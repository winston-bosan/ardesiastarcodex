@Nornagest, between his emphasis on biology, view on civilization and general approach to alien and unknown, denying racism in Lovecraft&#039;s work is like trying to deny its atheism to me.

I don&#039;t care either way, everyone&#039;s free to do alternative readings, but I can&#039;t help but sneer a bit as I would at Christians covering pagan statues with fig leaves.

Another point I see a lot is that he is only racist compared to our modern sensibilities, and that his racism is merely a reflection of his environment. He literally defended the Nazi party (although decrying its barbaric methods), which I doubt was anywhere close to median political opinion in 30s America.]]></description>

I had a Twitter exchange with the Quillette writer who wrote that. He says he got it from the hoaxers&#039; &lt;a href=&quot;http://leiterreports.typepad.com/files/project-summary-and-fact-sheet.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Project Summary and Fact Sheet&lt;/a&gt;, where they say:

&quot;The reviewers’ only concerns with these points so far have been that (1) we approach the topic with too much compassion for the students who are being subjected to this, and (2) we risk exploiting underprivileged
students by burdening them with an expectation to teach about privilege.&quot;

But I read the reviewer notes, as Eugene Dawn linked below, and...am I being too pedantic, or is that just a lie? Like, &quot;[treating privileged students this way] still makes me uncomfortable because it’s shame-y&quot; seems like an objection to me. Sure, it&#039;s weakly phrased, but especially in the context of claiming that they approach the topic with too much compassion (which as far as I can tell is also a lie), then I think it&#039;s a lie.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;The most common approach that I spot in the wild (including on here) is denial that there is anything intrinsically racist about Lovecraft’s fiction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I get the feeling you&#039;re picking a fight, but whatever.  Aside from &quot;The Horror at Red Hook&quot; and maybe a couple of others, that&#039;s a bullet I&#039;m willing to bite.  

It&#039;s also a fundamentally different statement, though.  You might for example be aware of Lovecraft&#039;s historical views and, if you&#039;re the type of person who thinks about this stuff all the time, be unable to read &lt;i&gt;The Shadow Over Innsmouth&lt;/i&gt; as anything other than a fable about miscegenation.   Disappointing, but fine.  It&#039;s even fairly likely that he &lt;i&gt;intended&lt;/i&gt; it as one to some extent, although if it were a straightforward screed it wouldn&#039;t have the last sentence it has.  But that doesn&#039;t make it &lt;i&gt;inherently&lt;/i&gt; racist as long as valid alternative readings exist.  It&#039;s a book, it doesn&#039;t have agency.  To be inherently anything it pretty much has to say it outright.]]></description>

These demographics aren&#039;t wildly different. The biggest differences between the two cities that one might expect to have an impact on public transit, the situation on the streets, etc, are the wider popularity and availability of heroin in San Francisco, and the much more rough-sleeping-friendly climate of San Francisco.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I’d mention the particularly absurd incident of an instrumental Zappa album getting an “explicit content” warning label for the title of one of its tracks, but this appears to be an urban legend. I find it believable that the warning label would be applied purely because of the censors’ personal dislike of Zappa with the track title as a pretext.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is widely reported and apparently false that the RIAA gave the 1986 album &lt;em&gt;Jazz from Hell&lt;/em&gt; a national Parental Advisory sticker. It is more likely that Zappa chose the name &quot;G-Spot tornado&quot; to protest the stickers, continuing his 1985 testimony. But there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openculture.com/2016/07/when-frank-zappas-instrumental-album-jazz-from-hell-received-an-explicit-lyrics-sticker.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;another claim&lt;/a&gt; that a particular chain gave it a sticker, with citation to a 2002 book.

It is true that a PMRC husband took official action against Zappa in another context, blocking his appointment to the Czechoslovak government.]]></description>
