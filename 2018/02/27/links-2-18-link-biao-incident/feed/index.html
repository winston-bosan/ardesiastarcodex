					<description><![CDATA[I just wanted to leave an extremely belated note that I have heard that the Basques also claim to speak the pre-Babel language.  (The legend is more plausible in their case since their language really is unlike that of any of their neighbors, whereas the linked article above says the Ewe are just a regular part of the Niger-Congo language family.  Also, the Basques have been Christian since late antiquity and therefore had more time to develop this myth - when did the Ewe become Christian?  And finally, the Ewe article no longer refers to any such tale - I wonder when it became part of the article and when it was removed.)]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rotherham is a fourth tier city in a country across the ocean and your referencing something that happened there ending half a dozen years ago.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Except that it didn&#039;t - &quot;grooming&quot; gangs are still in operation.  This is hardly the only UK town where such Muslim rape gangs operate.  And it isn&#039;t confined to the UK, or even just &#039;grooming&#039; gangs.  Mass sexual assault on New Years?  The ritual gang rape in  France, known as &quot;les tournantes&quot;?  

This is what you get when you let Islam into your society.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Not quite what I was getting at. Not wishing to get back into the weeds here, but I’m thinking of structural aspects. If I had to pick one it’s that Christianity starts as apolitical – “My kingdom is not of this world” – and makes its accommodation with worldly power, only later becoming powerful. Islam began as a political project, whether you accept the canonical version of its beginnings, or, what is seeming more likely, the idea that Islam began properly in the ninth century. The book to read here is In The Shadow Of The Sword by Tom Holland. Again, Harris is really good on that.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Check out Ehrman&#039;s book - Jewish apocalypticism at the time Jesus was around (most scholars agree he was an apocalypticist) and therefore early Christian apocalypticism is a bit different from the later Christian apocalypticism. It&#039;s a bit much to go into, but it would still be understood as political by people at the time - including, say, Roman governors. Not political like &quot;let&#039;s try to take over the world here and now&quot;, maybe more anti-political, but I wouldn&#039;t say it would have been understood as apolitical. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Speaking of books – thanks for those references. That’s another stack of thick books to add to my reading list 🙂 Have you read any of the Pope Benedict’s works on Christ? They look interesting.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Honestly, modern theology isn&#039;t my bag. My interest back when I was in school was critical study of the texts and the weird-but-extremely-cool story of how a minor Jewish peasant religious leader, executed by an imperial occupier, came to be the central figure of what would go on to become one of the world&#039;s major religions. 1st, 2nd century. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
N.B.: If you can recommend any authors specifically arguing against my case on Islam, I’d be very interested. I could only really find Doug Saunders, and he’s a shoddy arguer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Isn&#039;t Saunders mostly writing in a Canadian context? European and Canadian (North American, really) experiences of Muslim immigration are extremely different. People who appeal to one to discuss the other are being either ignorant or disingenous - they&#039;re not really comparable.]]></description>

I think the idea that the 2016 election was a WWC riot is an over-read and motivated reading it. 

After eight years of Obama, it was the Republican candidate&#039;s turn. That&#039;s all that&#039;s needed to understand the election. Any alternate theory bears a heavy burden of persuasion. Vague hand-waiving in the direction of the rust belt doesn&#039;t cut it.

In any event, even if I did buy the WWC riot theory, that still is vastly insufficient to justify unilateral love and respect towards a population from which I get back only contempt and hatred. At best it would justify certain policy tweaks.]]></description>

If no other reason, then because they can riot at the voting booth and help install a horrible government. The same as why I might tell my cousin that he should care about the fate of the poor inner city youth where he lives, when my cousin doesn&#039;t feel they respect him back at all. (And my cousin will scoff and say the riots hurt those inner city people more than him, why, that&#039;s proof they are stupid, you can&#039;t reason with that!!11)]]></description>

@Matt M, If Waco had happened a year earlier, when Bush Sr. was still president, you&#039;d see plenty of liberal outrage about it, and conservatives would never mention it. Since it happened during the Clinton presidency, it&#039;s liberals who don&#039;t like to talk about it, but I assure you I know plenty of liberals who don&#039;t approve of how the FBI and ATF handled that situation. It&#039;s really unfortunate that it is like that, as it shouldn&#039;t be a partisan issue (unless you believe, as seems very unlikely to me, that nothing similar could have happened under a Republican administration), but everything seems to end up that way in politics.]]></description>
