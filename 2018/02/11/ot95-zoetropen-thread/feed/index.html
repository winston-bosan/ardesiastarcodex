The hexagon is flat on the bottom for me, and the same goes for other polygons.

For the rational numbers, I have a sort of not-quite-visual concept of the dense order structure. Like, there are scattered points, but I am aware that if I look between the points I will find more points. This is different from real numbers which are in a straight line. Although since I&#039;ve been reading about nonstandard analysis lately I&#039;ve started to think of that line has having gaps in it too, where the infinitesimals should be.

I don&#039;t have any imagery for single integers (for the set of the integers I would think of evenly-spaced marks on an infinitely long ruler).

Higher-dimensional objects... well, I don&#039;t really know anything about them. Naively generalizing, a four-dimensional cube could presumably be thought of as an family of three-dimensional cubes parametrized by a real variable. So I have this picture of four or five cubes in a line in my mind, although that&#039;s more of a selection of a few cross-sections than a visualization of the whole object.]]></description>

My standard question when someone spams links to me goes like this: In your own words, what portions of the argument (which you ultimately find persuasive) do you think that each of your sources brings to the table? I live in the academic world; you make a list of references to go along with a written literature review section; it does not simply stand alone.]]></description>

No on two counts.

First, my wife has injured her foot so we aren&#039;t going. Alas.

But I did get another response via email from a mostly-lurker who will be there. I&#039;ll leave it to this individual to decide whether to reply to you in public, but it means there will be another SSCer on board. I&#039;d be very curious whether the two of you find each other.

Have a great time!]]></description>

@LadyJane

&lt;blockquote&gt;“trans women have some physiological traits associated with cis women and some physiological traits associated with cis men, and the former have a greater impact on their psychological state even though the latter are more obviously visible.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This sounds vague enough that we can likely swap in almost any condition which affects psychological state. It &lt;i&gt;certainly&lt;/i&gt; doesn&#039;t come with anything remotely close to the same rhetorical force of, &quot;A person has the &#039;mind&#039; of a male/female,&quot; which is why it seems like saying the latter is cheating.

&lt;blockquote&gt;your actual argument seemed to be “I’ve seen all the evidence and I’m not convinced,” which makes me feel like there’s little point in trying to persuade you otherwise.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not really. It&#039;s that I&#039;ve seen the brain scans. I&#039;m not convinced by them. That means that you can either proceed to explain why I&#039;ve insufficiently understood the evidence from brain scans, or you could also point to additional evidence aside from brain scans which you think make the point as well. &lt;a href=&quot;http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/02/04/open-thread-94-5/#comment-598581&quot;&gt;If I were teaching someone about aerodynamics&lt;/a&gt;, and they said, &quot;I don&#039;t think you can show lift over an airfoil via Bernoulli, because the flow doesn&#039;t have to meet back at the trailing edge at the same time,&quot; that doesn&#039;t mean that they&#039;re simply convinced that lift doesn&#039;t exist and there&#039;s not point in continuing. Instead, I have to go through the process of actually bothering to explain the details of the argument. Not doing so (especially when one suspects that his interlocutor is cheating, as above) is a pretty surefire way to not convince anyone.]]></description>

Iain, OK, maybe, &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; Chat&#039;s vague claims are false. Indeed, the decision of the OHRC to spell this out, both in 2014 and in response to Peterson is almost the opposite of her concerns about vague powers. But there is a big gap between her being wrong and Jane being right. I don&#039;t mean to pick on Jane, since she seems to have been dragged into the Canadian topic, but you specifically defended her reading. Moreover, you said that it was useful to read the law, when that is exactly where she went wrong. For example, her failure to know that &quot;discrimination&quot; includes &quot;harassment,&quot; although that is hardly original to Canada.

But the unconscionable error is in the CBA document. The content of any particular law hardly matters when the CBA is lying to you.]]></description>
