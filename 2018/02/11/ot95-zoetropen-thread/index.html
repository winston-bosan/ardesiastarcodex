<p>This is the bi-weekly visible open thread (there are also hidden open threads twice a week you can reach through the Open Thread tab on the top of the page). Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. You can also talk at the <b><A HREF="https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/">SSC subreddit</A></b> or the <b><A HREF="https://discord.gg/gpaTCxh">SSC Discord server</A></b>.  Also:</p>
<p>1. Happy Valentine&#8217;s Day! While you&#8217;re waiting for <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/18/practically-a-book-review-luna-whitepaper/">blockchain-based dating</A> to materialize, remember that there&#8217;s already a rationalist dating site, <A HREF="https://www.reciprocity.io/"><b>Reciprocity.io</b></A>. Go through your Facebook friends and check boxes for which ones you want to date or hang out with, and if they check you too the site will let you both know. It does require your Facebook friends also use the site, but if you&#8217;re socially exposed to the rationalist community many of them will. The Reciprocity team wants me to remind you that even if you&#8217;re already on there, this might be a good time to go back, update your selections, and see if anyone new has joined.</p>
<p>2. There will probably be an SSC meetup in Berkeley on March 3. I&#8217;ll post a clearer announcement later, but just wanted to give some advance warning.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m trying to find/source a quote from Richard Dawkins. It&#8217;s from some discussion (I think with a random person in an audience somewhere rather than someone famous), and essentially it&#8217;s along the lines of the below</p>
<p>Them: &#8216;Do you think humanities students are just not as intelligent as science students&#8217;<br />
Dawkins: &#8216;Oh no, I think humanities students are often just as intelligent as science students. But science students have something to be intelligent <i>about</i>&#8216;</p>
<p>Grateful for any help. Shockingly googling for Dawkins combined with things like &#8216;science&#8217; and &#8216;intelligence&#8217; don&#8217;t help me sift through the internet.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Is there an upper limit to human attractiveness, beyond which it only elicits diminishing responses?</p>
<p>Imagine there&#8217;s some neural mechanism in human brains that&#8217;s used to appraise physical attractiveness. What I&#8217;m wondering is if it&#8217;s capable of being completely maxed out, and whether everything over a certain point of hotness would be overkill.</p>
<p>Say you instructed a strong (and friendly!) AI to design what most humans would agree is the most attractive girl/guy possible. So through a series of optimizations, the AI uses its unfathomable knowledge of human biology and psychology to do just that.</p>
<p>Would the resulting human trigger a much different response than the people currently considered &#8220;the hottest&#8221;? Would it be like those Veelas in Harry Potter who make people completely lose their minds? Or would they just appear slightly more good-looking than your run-of-the-mill local beauty due to maxed out neural hotness receptors?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It seems like we could at least somewhat answer this with available data.  </p>
<p>First, look at how much difference in impact there is between (say) a woman at the 97th %ile for attractiveness (say, the prettiest girl in your dorm at college) and a woman at the 99.99th %ile for attractiveness (say, the prettiest professional model you can find).  When they walk through a restaurant or down a street, do we see notably more disruption from one than the other?  If we can find a way to measure impact of attractiveness, then that at least tells us whether we see large differences in impact within the range of attractiveness we can find by selecting among millions of people.  </p>
<p>Second, look at how much difference in impact there is between a very attractive woman (say, 97 %ile) with cosmetics and careful wardrobe choices to maximize attractiveness, vs jeans and a T-shirt and no cosmetics.  That tells us about whether we can have a noticeable effect on the impact of attractiveness with existing widely-used interventions we can do now.  </p>
<p>Third, look at the same question, but with plastic surgery.  (Though you have to be careful&#8211;some plastic surgery gets into uncanny valley territory.)  </p>
<p>Fourth, look at image enhancement techniques&#8211;see how much more impact you can get from a 97%ile woman after the professionals at a fashion magazine have done everything they can to max out her attractiveness.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Attractiveness isn&#8217;t a quantitative factor, but a qualitative one.</p>
<p>A better way to look at attractiveness, if we insist on numbers, is that people are compared to an ideal &#8211; or more likely, set of ideals &#8211; and their attractiveness is measured as a percentage of that ideal.  The best we can figure, the ideal is something like &#8220;average of people seen&#8221;, at least to a first degree of approximation.  (That is, facial averaging software produces faces that are pretty close to &#8220;perfect&#8221; attractiveness).  Obviously the brain isn&#8217;t running facial averaging software, so this is better regarded as a metaphor than the way things work.</p>
<p>101% attractiveness doesn&#8217;t make any sense, so there isn&#8217;t an overload problem.</p>
<p>There probably is a diminishing return.  And, amusingly, it is probably reached far lower than most people might expect; at, or perhaps even just below, average.</p>
<p>Think about it this way: How would the most shallow assholes imaginable react to an individual?  The biggest difference isn&#8217;t between &#8220;Meh&#8221; and &#8220;Woah!&#8221;, it is between &#8220;Ugh&#8221; and &#8220;Meh&#8221;, because that is the cut-off at which point dating somebody is socially acceptable within their social group.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p> The best we can figure, the ideal is something like “average of people seen”, at least to a first degree of approximation.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think this gets causation backwards. When you average faces, you&#8217;re going to remove small imperfections and asmymetries; that doesn&#8217;t mean symmetry and lack of blemish is only valued due to being close to an average.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>There is also gross anatomy to consider; the ideal face shape, for example.  Averages also happen to get this at least close to right.</p>
<p>Which is why I consider it a useful metaphor.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;d guess it is some kind of weighted composite of faces you have seen; black people who grow up around more white people often find white people more attractive than black, to pick an example that will annoy some people.  There is something going on there.  &#8220;Average&#8221; is a decent metaphor for whatever the hell it is.</p>
<p>But the fact that a single person can have multiple types of attractiveness &#8211; for example, maybe a long-haired brunette is attractive, but also a short-haired blonde.  Which is what I was getting at with &#8220;multiple ideals&#8221;.  So multiple weighted composites which don&#8217;t intersect.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d guess Freud would say something about mothers, I&#8217;d guess it is about positive affect &#8211; so you tend to be attracted to the clusters of characteristics you associate with positive feelings.  (Cluster of characteristics might be a better way of looking at it than compositing, really)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Thegnskald:</p>
<p>That sounds plausible, but how would you know if you were wrong?  What would we observe in a world where there really was an implicit ideal standard of beauty in everyone&#8217;s mind and we were measuring how close to that ideal someone got?  </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have any data, but one thing that seems off about your model is that you do, in fact, see people who grew up in (say) China surrounded by people who all look Chinese then go to Europe or the US and find someone with European features extremely attractive.  Or media consumers who don&#8217;t spend a lot of time hanging out with Somalians or even non-whites immediately finding, say, Iman Abdulmajid.  </p>
<p>How can I grow up around whites during the whole time I&#8217;m growing/building my ideal beautiful woman model, and then go to Japan and find some woman I meet there extremely attractive?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Well, it seems to me that we&#8217;d need not only an implicit standard of beauty but also some metric for how close you get to it, integrating across several very different dimensions, and there&#8217;s nothing saying that that metric must always weight (say) melanin levels or epicanthic folds highly.  And it seems to me that for most features, the amount of variation within an ethnicity is usually going to be higher than the amount of variation between ethnicities &#8212; so we wouldn&#8217;t be talking a hard restriction here but rather a statistical tendency.  </p>
<p>Also, &#8220;attraction&#8221; is not quite the same thing as &#8220;beauty&#8221;.  It seems quite plausible to me that someone might go to a faraway country, meet somebody, and find the locals somewhat less than perfectly <i>beautiful</i> by the standards they&#8217;re used to but more <i>attractive</i> &#8212; perhaps because their culture emphasizes attitudes that the traveler&#8217;s developed a liking for.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Hey local rocket scientists/engineers (I like that this is a place where that works): can John Schilling or one of you other fine people either explain to me (or point me to a good explanation of) why ignition of rocket engines is so difficult?</p>
<p>This is brought to my attention by the recent Falcon Heavy reignite failure, but it&#8217;s been weighing on me for a while . Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I understand the general principle that a rocket ignition that doesn&#8217;t happen on the ground Must Work. But I note that many in-orbit systems choose extremely hypergolic fuels despite what seem like serious disadvantages (lower performance, hilarious toxicity), and even rockets that use good ol&#8217; RP-1 (or LH2)/LOX often require TEA or the like to fire.  </p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m totally wrong about this, but it really doesn&#8217;t seem like it should be particularly hard to ignite liquid oxygen.  (Wikipedia claims one reason we abandoned LOX-based exposives was their tendency to spontaneously detonate!)  Sure, it&#8217;s cryogenic, but it&#8217;s also pure oxygen!  Apollo 13 certainly found a tank of liquid oxygen to be easily ignited by sparks.  (Though I guess the on-ground incident that caused the damage is evidence against this&#8230;)  </p>
<p>Overall my question remains: why is reliable engine ignition an extremely hard problem, as opposed to &#8220;introduce some small energy source into a nice mix of liquid oxygen and anything?&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I am not John, and he knows much more than I do, but I know at least part of the answer.  Basically, it&#8217;s really easy to turn the engine into shrapnel if you get it wrong.  After all, you&#8217;re feeding in a mix of a strong and concentrated oxidizer and a fuel.  If they mix, you get an explosive.  So you need to be very very sure that your ignition system works before enough propellant gets in to make that happen.  You can&#8217;t just try again, because now you have a bomb.  Hypergolics, of course, don&#8217;t have this problem.  (This is why Gemini got ejection seats, actually.)  Much of the work goes into &#8220;don&#8217;t be a bomb&#8221;, and if something goes wrong, the engine is most likely to not start instead.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Bean got part of it.  You need <i>immediate, uniform</i> ignition because you are pumping propellant into the engine at a prodigious rate and if any part of it doesn&#8217;t ignite within milliseconds, you&#8217;ve got the makings of a bomb.  This requires not just a very robust ignition source, it requires reliable, immediate, and uniform mixing of the propellant, because you can&#8217;t ignite rocket fuel if the rocket oxidizer is in a separate injection stream somewhere else.</p>
<p>The other part is that, for liquid-propellant rocket engines at least, it isn&#8217;t just <i>ignition</i> we are concerned with, it is engine startup.  &#8220;Engine&#8221;, as in piece of machinery that includes e.g. a very powerful fuel pump.  You need that, because once you do ignite the propellants in the rocket chamber, they will generate an extremely high pressure that impedes further flow of propellant.  And pretty nearly the only energy source that will suffice for a large rocket-grade fuel pump is to tap off some fraction of the energy produced by the burning propellant.  Which leads to an obvious catch-22, and a potential for instability, and you wind up having to choreograph an elaborate boostrap sequence starting from an independent power source, transitioning to feedback from the main engine through one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas-generator_cycle" rel="nofollow">several </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expander_cycle" rel="nofollow">interesting</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staged_combustion_cycle" rel="nofollow">cycles</a>, and keeping propellant flow, pump power, and energy transfer neatly balanced all the way to full power.</p>
<p>If this fails, the best you can hope for is that the engine sputters and dies.  Sometimes the turbopump overspeeds and explodes.  Sometimes you wind up with unburnt propellant accumulating and mixing in the chamber until it finds a spark.  Sometimes the whole thing just shakes itself apart.</p>
<p>Two other aggravating factors.  If one or both of your propellants are cryogenic (SpaceX uses liquid oxygen), then the first bit of propellant to enter the pumps and feed lines is going to boil instead of flowing neatly into the engine.  You&#8217;ll want to prechill all the plumbing to prevent that, but the only coolant readily available for that purpose is the propellant that you <i>don&#8217;t</i> want accumulating in the engine.  And if you are starting the engine in flight, then in the brief interval when you don&#8217;t have an engine running the vehicle will be in near-freefall.  Which means fluids can&#8217;t be counted on to flow to and accumulate in the &#8220;bottom&#8221; of the system before you&#8217;ve got a pump working to force them where you want them to go.</p>
<p>Also, if you&#8217;re trying to start an engine in flight, you don&#8217;t have the option of pressing the abort button and saying &#8220;that didn&#8217;t work, let&#8217;s see if we can fix it and try again tomorrow&#8221;.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>“introduce some small energy source into a nice mix of liquid oxygen and anything?”</p>
<p>&#8220;A nice mix of liquid oxygen and anything&#8221; does not necessarily describe the conditions in a rocket motor prior to startup and reaching a good steady state. </p>
<p>Keep in mind that it&#8217;s not like you&#8217;ve got a static pool of well-mixed already vaporized kerosene and LOX &#8211; you&#8217;re flowing both into the chamber at a high rate. You need to get ALL of that going, basically all at once, and that takes a LOT of energy (particularly for a complex molecule like kerosene &#8211; LOX / LH2 is still hard). I think even some the spark based engines use a small preburner to basically create a mini torch into the main chamber. I&#8217;m sure there is some amount of electric sparking you could dump into the chamber to make it work, but it would almost certainly consume more power (and therefore more weight, in the form of batteries) compared to the TEA-TEB system used on Falcon.</p>
<p>Falcon 9 is in even a weirder situation where it has to reignite, not in a nice zero gravity vacuum, but while zipping ass-first through the atmosphere, which I would think adds to the problem.</p>
<p>On top of all that you have to get the turbopumps going, and most rocket engines can only throttle over a limited range. Basically it&#8217;s a very complex, self-driving, self-cooling system that is very hard to operate outside a narrow band of parameters, and will often blow up outside that narrow range, so startup is something you want to get through ASAFP with 100% reliability. That&#8217;s much easier to do with a hypergolic (or spark-and-mini-flame) system.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Hmm.  I think most recreational drugs are fundamentally antisocial in that they either displace or degrade social interaction.  There are exceptions, of course, in particular &#8220;party drugs&#8221;, but the most conspicuous of these is the one that needs no research because it predates (and may have been instrumental in creating) human civilization.</p>
<p>So, to the extent that a society feels it has the right to meddle in such matters (most do) and has the power to do so without socially destructive Wars On Drugs, it may be in society&#8217;s collective interest to block widespread use of recreational drugs other than alcohol.  That <i>probably</i> points to blocking research into such drugs, unless maybe that research can be channeled towards socially useful ones.</p>
<p>Or society could shut up and mind its own business, but I&#8217;m not holding my breath.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Depends on who you ask.</p>
<p>My answer will tend to be &#8220;Yes&#8221;, if for no other reason than people are doing some really terrible drugs right now, and if we could make recreational drugs that are less terrible, that would be a win.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>But where is the profit in that?  The people who actually make the recreational drugs are going to want to make them intensely addictive, and they are going to want to make them enjoyable in solitude rather than limiting their customer base to people who already have enough friends to throw a party.</p>
<p>The people who insist on selling &#8220;party drugs&#8221; are going to find that the biggest profit is is in selling something which works really well off-label as a &#8220;date-rape drug&#8221;.</p>
<p>And if you let Society(tm) centrally plan the recreational-drug R&amp;D program for maximal social benefit, they&#8217;ll probably give you <a href="http://firefly.wikia.com/wiki/G-23_Paxilon_Hydrochlorate" rel="nofollow">G-23 Paxilon Hydrochlorate</a>.</p>
<p>And, yeah, there will be some freakish anarchists and rationalists and whatnot who want better nootropics and personality-enhancing hallucinogens and whatnot, but don&#8217;t kid yourself that this will be anything but a fringe of the market.</p>

<blockquote><p>I agree with this last part. I can think of many people who could run Nathan’s diner program well – but I notice Trump hasn’t put any of them in charge of anything. In fact, I can think of many people who could run a country well – but I notice Trump. Maybe things are more complicated than this?</p>

<p>And “ability to go elsewhere” is probably the most important ingredient. If I really want, I can spend some time looking into the dangers of sugary fruit juice. In fact, I did this a few years ago and haven’t bought any since; just like that, all of the horrors of capitalism lost their power over me. The last drink I bought was a sugar-free sparkling organic kiwi dragonfruit french soda with a total of five calories, because I personally preferred that to the two-thousand-or-so other options available within a five block walk of my house.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I also spent a long time looking into the dangers of Trump. I voted against Trump. I begged other people to vote against Trump. I wrote a blog post officially endorsing literally any person in the world who was not Trump. Despite all of this, Donald Trump is my president. I feel less satisfied with this system than with the other one, honestly.</p>
<p>Getting to choose my own food (and schools, and health care) works for me. I don’t want poor people to have to settle for anything less.</p></blockquote>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My wife and I leaned towards the natural/attachment side. It required fairly little of me, although it prevented some things others might value, like nights out alone or a swift return to work for the mother. Our children were happy and healthy from birth to present, n=3 and all, but their parents are generally healthy and easy going as well, so who knows where causation lies. My wife enjoyed having the children wrapped to her, and hey, it frees up the hands. Cloth diapers are good for the environment and cheaper, and breastfeeding is cheaper and less likely to cause allergies, especially if the mother is willing to try changing her diet.<br />
I did rebut my wife&#8217;s assertions that too much crying would cause brain damage or similar justification with the reasoning that &#8220;if that were true, the species would have died out long ago&#8221;&#8211;though the same reasoning led me to not fear co-sleeping, given we don&#8217;t smoke or drink. But on the same grounds, the intense dislike I have for a babies cries is probably not an instinct designed to lead me to encourage such behavior.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You know, I&#8217;m pretty skeptical of the baby advice industry. I probably lean a lot more towards &#8220;your instincts are probably correct, just do whatever feels natural.&#8221; My sister&#8217;s first kid sort of reinforced this: she read that the baby was only supposed to receive X ounces of milk at a time, and therefore only fed X ounces of milk at a time. Baby was always hungry, and screamed bloody murder non-stop. Baby was eventually fed to baby&#8217;s content, and baby stopped screaming. </p>
<p>This seems pretty reasonable to me.</p>
<p>Then I saw what my sister-in-law. And&#8230;.What. The. Fuck. She&#8217;d watch The Walking Dead with her kid. He STILL sleeps with her and refuses to sleep in his own bed (he&#8217;s 5). He didn&#8217;t start talking until he was 3, possibly in part because she never talks to him, he still speaks poorly, he&#8217;s hyper-active, and I think he&#8217;s still not even fully potty-trained (so I don&#8217;t know how the hell he is supposed to start kindergarten. Wear diapers? Still?)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know WTF happened with that, but there are clearly some missing lessons that might require some baby-book advice.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think Brad overstated the case a bit there, but there is a valid core in the argument, in that the argument for trans rights wasn&#8217;t much different than the argument for, say, gay rights.</p>
<p>Extrapolating out is, however, very difficult, because you don&#8217;t know what arguments people will come up with tomorrow, which is sort of the core of the whole thing.</p>
<p>Some predictions: Men&#8217;s rights will continue to slowly improve, because, as uncomfortable as society is with it, nobody can present any arguments against it.  Circumcision will probably be a cultural battlefield in the next few years, since support for it has gradually declined, and looks like it might reach a critical mass soon.</p>
<p>Poly rights will enter into the fray sometime in the next ten years.  I don&#8217;t know the outcome, because I don&#8217;t know the arguments, but I can see it building.</p>
<p>Prisoner rights will become a thing again, as a result of the rape thing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll have to think about it.  I&#8217;ll get back to you.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ve orphaned this thread by deleting the post re-created below while Thengskald was posting. Upon rereading I felt I was doing little other than attempting to sound clever. But, to avoid having questions about what this subthread is about, here is the deleted post:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p><a rel="nofollow"href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/02/11/ot95-zoetropen-thread/#comment-600547">I do think</a> someone with a particular set of meta-norms about respect and self identification going into that coma would pretty quickly see what was going and adopt the new norm without much fuss.</p></blockquote>
<p><i><br />
Curious if you would venture a guess as to what new norms may develop over the next five or ten years once as those norms are applied further afield.<br />
Will transracial take-off? There may not be brain scans to back it up, but what has that to do with respect, politeness, self-identification, etc. We&#8217;re often told that the definition of white expanded over the centuries to include Irish, Italian, Polish, etc. Would those principles suggest we&#8217;ll see other categories likewise expand, or for the concept to break down entirely?<br />
Will the mockery around trans-species or otherkin Tumblr snowflakes be viewed as bigotry, the new form of white supremacy, etc.?<br />
Will the institutionalized search for the fundamental particle of microaggression yield fruitful territory in engineering new forms of equality, or ought they realize that their goals have been won and there is nowhere else to push the borders, simply left with eternal vigilance of the newly established norms?<br />
I might have gotten carried away with the purple prose there, but the point is if these admittedly novel conventions are firmly rooted in established norms it should be possible to trace out their trajectory in advance as easily as convincing the 2008 Rip Van Winkle of continuity with the principles of xer time.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>I think it will change as soon as popular perception becomes that it is unacceptable to discriminate against men, and I think a lot of conservatives will go along with this one.  I used to talk to a young Christian man, who watched church attendance among men plummet &#8211; because the sermons were increasingly anti-father.  The particular case he gave which caused him to have serious doubts about continuing to attend was a father&#8217;s day sermon that was 100% berating the men in the congregation for the problem of children growing up without fathers.  He was never pro-men&#8217;s-rights, but he saw serious issues with the way men are treated in our culture, and if his observations of the congregation were correct, so did the other men in his church.</p>
<p>As far as funding goes, I think government funding for men&#8217;s issues in any significant capacity is much further down the road; the major shifts will be cultural, first.</p>
<p><i>As much as I wish it were the case, I don’t see anything happening with circumcision.

<p>The point that will make this work is that most circumcision in the US isn&#8217;t done by Jewish people.  I imagine, however, a religious exemption will probably end up being carved out &#8211; and I imagine the practice will die out regardless in a couple more decades.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Existing age of consent laws seem like a possible target. The ages got pushed up substantially over the past century and then restrictions on pre-marital sex get massively loosened, with the result that, in some states, the median age for loss of virginity is below the age of consent. </p>
<p>A lot of the people who would oppose lowering the age are also people with an idealized version of European, especially Scandinavian societies. At some point they may have to face the fact that the only even partly European state with as high an age of consent as California is Turkey, and most European states set it at fourteen or fifteen, below the U.S. median.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Why would you think this? If anything, hostility towards age gaps in relationships is growing, at least if it involves an older man. It&#8217;s seen as more exploitative than it used to be. If age of consent laws have changed recently, it&#8217;s been to raise them. If some director were to do today what Roman Polanski did back then, they would get hit so much harder than he did. Roman Polanski was in the 70s, sure &#8211; you seem to be alluding to that weird moment in the 70s where some people were quite lenient in their views about statutory rape &#8211; but to give another example, I think Chaplin would get hit harder today than he was in his time.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>There&#8217;s not really one far left, is there? I think there&#8217;s a very strong anti-libertine streak on the left, especially parts of the non-mainstream left today. The libertine streak in the 70s was not entirely the doing of the far left, either &#8211; while you had stuff like the Weather Underground trying to get rid of monogamy as bourgeois, you also had coked-up rockstars having sex with 15-year old groupies and not getting nailed for statutory rape, and while libertinism is usually left-coded, it&#8217;s not <i>political</i>.</p>
<p>I think on some parts of the far left (and this is a spectrum &#8211; this bleeds into the mainstream left, just as the far right bleeds into the mainstream right) you&#8217;ve got an anti-libertine attitude that comes from their understanding of power dynamics. Porn isn&#8217;t OK, BDSM isn&#8217;t OK, they make fun of poly people (the joke trope is the bearded poly guy who makes a big deal of saying he&#8217;s poly, or the woman with an undercut and her bearded boyfriend making a joint Tinder profile to look for women for threesomes and claim they&#8217;re &#8220;queer&#8221;), and they generally disagree with the notion that &#8220;anything two consenting adults do is OK&#8221;. </p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t really new, either. A decent chunk of later second-wave feminism, especially the more radfem bits, involved women who had experienced free love as coercive and as giving license to men to act in a predatory fashion.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Circumcision is interesting in this context. Done on infants it clearly violates consent. There are cases now of puberty blocking hormones being administered to pre-teens who feel trans (is that the same as a trans teen?)&#8211;Wikipedia says &#8220;commonly&#8221; though if pressed I don&#8217;t have examples at hand.<br />
Presumably the child is requesting this medical intervention, but they are considered too young to give consent to a great many things at the point that this is relevant, so I can see arguments made based on identity that hormone blockers are somewhat analogous to circumcision.<br />
Circumcision also brings in religious liberty issues, and frankly with only minor shifting of the overton window I could see this being seen as a quite extreme test case. What&#8217;s worse, a native wanting to partake some controlled substance, or a Jew or Muslim wanting to perform risky, elective surgery on their child&#8217;s genitals? On the other hand, I can foresee some extreme comparisons being made to a country banning a historic element of Judaic religion.</p>
<blockquote><p>Prisoner rights will become a thing again, as a result of the rape thing.</p></blockquote>
<p>It would be nice if it stopped being a joke. I could be talked into harsh sentences for harsh crimes, but the attitude that we should make criminals afraid of prison due to lax oversight of abuse is repellent.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Perhaps, but it is not a a case of looking for allowances to harm yourself, it&#8217;s allowances to cut your child&#8217;s genitals. This is at the confluence of consent, sexuality, religion, medicine&#8230; It could be very interesting, and I don&#8217;t say that just because it will be blue-on-blue. </p>
<p>Actually, Jews tend towards Liberals, but do the Jews who feel strongly pro-circumcision do so as well? I don&#8217;t know.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>True, but a religious exemption deals with the major objections neatly, and is on-line with the way we have handled this sort of problem historically.</p>
<p>But my confidence isn&#8217;t very strong on it (the exemption) happening, it depends on how strong the social pressure / social movement is.</p>

<p>The best non-religious argument in favor of circumcision that I&#8217;ve ever heard was &#8220;so I don&#8217;t need to spend so long cleaning shit out of there when I change his diaper.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Chiming in to say that you should definitely NOT be cleaning out the foreskin of a baby boy. It will still be highly connective with the glans and cause damage and pain if you force it apart to get in there to clean it. It will naturally separate as the child gets older and will keep itself clean without intervention. The rare case of UTI&#8217;s can be treated trivially with antibiotics.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Puberty blockers could raise a different set of issues, something I speculated about in <i>Future Imperfect</i>, when I was apparently behind on the tech. </p>
<blockquote><p>In our society people are not supposed to become sexually active until they become adults. In practice, it doesn&#8217;t work that way, leading to problems with which anyone who reads newspapers, watches television, or worries about his own children, is familiar. The essential problem is that we are physically ready to reproduce before we are emotionally or economically ready. That has become increasingly true as the age of physical maturity has fallen&#8211;by about two years over the past century, probably as a result of improved nutrition.<br />
With the continuing progress of medical science, we may soon be able to reverse that change.<br />
Suppose a drug company announces a new medication&#8211;one that will safely delay puberty for a year, or two years, or three years.  I predict that there will be a considerable demand for the product. Are parents who artificially delay the physical development of their daughters guilty of child abuse? May schools pressure parents to give the medication to boys about to reach puberty, as many now do for other forms of medication designed to make children behave more nearly as schoolteachers wish them to? If schools do require it, are parents who refuse to artificially delay the development of their sons guilty of child abuse—or at least subject to the same pressures as parents who today refuse to put their sons on Ritalin?<br />
While we are at it, what about the application of a similar technology to other species? Cats are lovely creatures, but kittens are much more fun. If only they stayed kittens a little longer …  .</p></blockquote>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>As I say above, I don&#8217;t have any good answers. But I would say that in 2008 I was in a professional grad school and there were already trans activists. The relevent club was already LGBT and there was already pressure in the group to look beyond gay marriage to issues that were important to trans people. Not that I thought back then that things would move nearly as quickly as they have, but there was a plausible path from there to here.</p>
<p>Today, I have no connections to institutions of higher learning. Well except paying the debts they left me with. Anyway, if there aren&#8217;t already interest / pressure groups on at least several college campuses regarding say poly or prisoners rights, then I&#8217;d say it is probably not going to have exploded to the mainstream ten years hence. Things can move very quickly these days, but there&#8217;s has to be a kernel of ideas to build on in the first place.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My guess is that support for prisoners&#8217; rights has to do with how upset/scared people are about crime, which is loosely correlated with how much crime there actually is.  If we see a huge crime spike, or a huge spike in fear/outrage about crime, then political interest in prisoners&#8217; rights will fade.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The kernel is in the current metoo movement (or rather the broader anti-sexual-assault movement), which is going to end up including men regardless of what its current proponents intend.</p>
<p>Once it includes men, and once you have a few prisoners speaking out, then it will be very difficult to fight against it.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say whether the poly movement will succeed or fail, but I can see the start of a movement starting up about &#8211; what, twenty, thirty years ago now?  Whenever that goddamn book was written &#8211; and just now starting to accumulate some inertia.  It will be sold, like everything else, as physiological/genetic/predetermined, as many poly people today sell it &#8211; there are people who are simply unable to be monogamous, and if forced into that situation, they will cheat on their partners.</p>

<blockquote><p>Some predictions: Men’s rights will continue to slowly improve, because, as uncomfortable as society is with it, nobody can present any arguments against it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Plenty of people present arguments against it, some are:<br />
&#8211; That men don&#8217;t have any structural/institutional problems, so there is nothing to improve<br />
&#8211; That men have all the power and/or are the sole cause of male problems, so it&#8217;s specifically up to them to fix any issues they have, not an obligation of society as a whole<br />
&#8211; That women&#8217;s problems are much worse, so we should exclusively focus on that for<strike>ever</strike> now<br />
&#8211; That demanding attention for men&#8217;s issues is not honest, but a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism" rel="nofollow">strategy</a> in the culture war</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen with #metoo that male victims and female perpetrators were generally ignored as much as possible by most of society, so the bias is still very strong. I think that a serious threat to female or general societal well-being, caused by men&#8217;s issues, is necessary before the bias is confronted. I suspect that the flash point will be male under-performance at colleges and the (increasingly) bad job situation for poorly educated people. Basically, women will increasingly have trouble finding the mates they desire and will be less able to benefit from benevolent sexism. This automatically means that the sacrifices that men make can&#8217;t be taken for granted as much. Furthermore, this severely weakens the memetically strong feminist narrative of men doing so well because they oppress others.</p>
<p>Of course, a shortage of well-educated and high-earning men makes the normalization of polyamory more likely, as more women will logically seek to share top tier men. If this solution is favored strongly, it may prevent a serious push to help men and instead, cause severe issues if men either start giving up on participating in society en mass (like in Japan) or try to take down the system (which is probably more likely in the US than Japan, because the US has a far more violent culture).</p>
<p>As for circumcision, that has become a (low intensity) atheist vs Muslim/Jews issue in my country (because Dutch people with a Christian background never adopted the practice). It seems plausible that part of blue tribe will ally with Muslims and/or Jews for culture war reasons. Generally, when people start talking about a law against it, you get the real backlash. Of course, even without a law, the practice may mostly just die out among Americans with a Christian background.</p>

<p>Nah.  The bias will be confronted like everything else; one day, suddenly, it will be Wrong to say men aren&#8217;t discriminated against, and a bunch of people will be fed to Moloch before people get the hint.  I don&#8217;t really look forward to that era, when, just after getting what I want, I will have to become The Enemy of Progress again for yelling at my ex-allies on the internet over mob justice.  Sigh.</p>
<p>This one is on the brink of falling over the edge &#8211; hell, I hear muggles talking about men&#8217;s rights now &#8211; and if not for Trump&#8217;s election distracting everybody with nonsense, I suspect it already would have.  I expect the sudden social shift anytime between this year &#8211; seriously &#8211; and five years from now, depending entirely on when something triggers it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikd0ZYQoDko" rel="nofollow">This is the sort of thing that will shove it over.</a>  Granted, that is from 2014, but the shift in tone on these matters over the last eight years has been quite remarkable; if that came out today, in the current anti-sexual-assault climate, it would be over tomorrow.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Circumcision will probably be a cultural battlefield in the next few years, since support for it has gradually declined, and looks like it might reach a critical mass soon.</p></blockquote>
<p>Porn.  An important driver for this will be porn&#8211;not that anybody is likely to admit it.  A major norm, at least in the US, is that the foreskin is weird and therefore gross.  (Consider, as a random example, Dean Venture&#8217;s various <a href="http://venturebrothers.wikia.com/wiki/Dr._Quymn,_Medicine_Woman" rel="nofollow">love</a> <a href="http://venturebrothers.wikia.com/wiki/The_Better_Man" rel="nofollow">interests</a> shuddering in revulsion upon discovering that Mr. Baldy will forever wear his turtleneck.)  The domestic porn industry has been extremely sensitive to this and basically never cast a man who was not circumcised.  </p>
<p>But California has passed laws that are (AFAIK) devastating the domestic porn industry.  The only thing US audiences want to see less than a foreskin is a condom.  Meanwhile, the international porn industry is much less inclined to cater to US specific biases.  I honestly can&#8217;t remember the last time I&#8217;ve seen a circumcised man.  We are currently raising a generation that will not share the previously prevailing notion that the foreskin is weird and gross.  Hell, older generations that are being exposed to the current porn landscape will have their anti-foreskin norm eroded.</p>
<p>In the not to distant future I foresee a &#8220;why do we do this again?&#8221; moment. If, in that moment, there is a slight &#8220;mutilating the genitals of infants is <i>probably </i>not cool&#8221; nudge, the practice will be on the outs.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>A good response to this will take some unpacking, because almost every word in that sentence is &#8211; wrong is the wrong word, but certainly not right.</p>
<p>First, I didn&#8217;t say rational.  I said argument.  A woman crying is an argument, based on the prior that you care about her pain.</p>
<p>Second, even if I had said rational, it would still apply; crying, as an argument, is an entirely rational way to demonstrate pain, as it is a difficult to convincingly fake signal of pain.  Assuming a shared prior that the other person cares about her pain, she has made a convincing argument that she is in it, and that thus the situation needs to change in some way.</p>
<p>Third, yes, rational arguments tend to be the driving force behind social change.  They are what movements coordinate on; the emotional shitshow is just what you see from the outside, because you are far removed from the coordination, and seeing the uncoordinated messes at the edges.  And by coordination, I do not mean a literal group of people in charge, I mean the influential members of the group trading ideas back and forth.  Most people get their cues from individuals who act as movement schelling points; these individuals are the elements of the movement responsive to arguments.  Members of the movement are less vulnerable to argument because they want to know their social group will approve of them, which requires their local schelling point to give arguments stamps of approval; this is perfectly rational behavior, because somebody who isn&#8217;t smart enough to identify the flaws in an argument shouldn&#8217;t therefore change opinion every time an argument is made, but instead appoint a trusted somebody to evaluate arguments for them.  But even the partisans can be swayed if it becomes apparent that there isn&#8217;t anybody on their side who can effectively respond to an argument.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>What happens when three thought leaders make up and go along with new doctrine A, four buy into the argument and switch sides, five ignore the argument and go along as before, and two make up and go along with new doctrine B?</p>
<p>It is kind of a self-correcting problem.  When thought leaders do that, they fragment their followers, and either become the leader of a tiny cult, or else their congregation gradually dissolves as the world marches on.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Poly rights will enter into the fray sometime in the next ten years. I don’t know the outcome, because I don’t know the arguments, but I can see it building.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes there are poly people on SSC and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s all working out great for you. Normalization is something else, though. Poly is a really weird one to me, because it&#8217;s not like Chesterton&#8217;s Fence where everybody&#8217;s saying &#8220;hey, what&#8217;s this fence doing here?&#8221; and the bull is lurking quietly on the other side. No, this is a glass wall, with a clearly visible rampaging bull bouncing and snorting and turning red with steam coming out of its nose like a Bugs Bunny cartoon. The normalization of poly relationships or marriages is not &#8220;everybody just loses their hang-ups and broadens their lovemaking horizons.&#8221; The normalization of poly relationships means Donald Trump has 100 wives.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to start with some celebrities, because no shit of course some Hollywood star can afford two women or two men, and they&#8217;ll make a reality show out of it, and then it&#8217;ll be normal, and then your dentist has two wives because why not? And then the pareto distribution eats society.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Maybe one way to see how this would work out in practice is to look at societies where openly keeping a mistress and some bastards is socially acceptable.  Or to look at Muslim societies where people are allowed to have multiple wives.  (Though I think Islamic law restricts men to no more than five wives&#8211;that might actually be a societal adaptation to the problem of very high-prestige men having a hundred wives.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>What&#8217;s changed today is that there is now a link at the bottom of the page for the book to a single file that has all of it, in addition to the links to individual chapters and the bibliography.</p>
<p>What has changed between the 2012 version and the current one? Lots of minor things. I would have to read and compare to see if there are any major changes, and that would be a lot of work.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Over on the thread about &#8220;The Case against Education&#8221;, we were discussing conformism as a quality employers seek. I&#8217;m wondering whether that&#8217;s really something all employers want, since some of them at least talk a good line about wanting people who &#8220;think different&#8221; or whatnot. But looking back on my career in a number of software companies, I&#8217;m struck by how ordinary all of my colleagues have been. If I had to pick the two oddest, there was one guy who has a New Order Mennonite and another who was openly homosexual. But neither of those are really all that odd.</p>
<p>Has anyone had a very different experience, and worked with some real freaks?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ve been told that I&#8217;m the team freak by every team I&#8217;ve ever worked with, so&#8230; yes ? That said, I&#8217;ve also worked with quite a few extraordinary people, as well as some more ordinary ones.</p>
<p>That said, having been on both the employer&#8217;s and the employee&#8217;s side of things a few times, I&#8217;d say that the traditional sense of &#8220;conformism&#8221; is too strong to describe what employers seek. Nobody wants a yes-man on the team who is just going to do whatever you tell him to do, to the letter &#8212; otherwise, you&#8217;d just replace him with a script. However, nobody wants a self-proclaimed rock-star genius, either; at least, not the kind of genius who will start randomly rewriting all your libraries from scratch just because he doesn&#8217;t like the way you format your braces. </p>
<p>Joining a team requires one to be able to learn, which does require some degree of conformity; but it is also expected that one would offer original ideas (and not merely offer them, but defend them), once he had learned enough.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yes, I should have said &#8220;conformity&#8221;, not &#8220;conformism&#8221;. It&#8217;s about being able to fit in and not piss people off, not about mindlessly doing what you are told. You&#8217;re right about that.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s a bit cliche at this point &#8211; but I think it&#8217;s true that most employers are looking for diversity of background, but <i>not</i> diversity of thought.</p>
<p>Background diversity (which roughly maps to race/gender/sexuality &#8211; but not quite!) is good just because it&#8217;s interesting.  I&#8217;m as skeptical of &#8220;diversity is our strength&#8221; claims as anyone &#8211; but I&#8217;ll readily concede that it&#8217;s just plain more interesting to work with co-workers who come from a wide variety of diverse backgrounds and can tell me stories about their childhood and upbringing that are unlike anything I ever experienced.</p>
<p>But when it comes time to work &#8211; everyone is expected to conform to &#8220;how we do things around here&#8221; and little deviation is tolerated.  Similarly, having unorthodox personal or political opinions is frowned upon &#8211; presumably for HR reasons.</p>
<p>Edit:  I&#8217;ll also add that diversity of background benefits the employer &#8211; if only for image purposes.  It makes their HR and recruiting teams look really good if they can find those &#8220;diamonds in the rough.&#8221;  Finding someone who grew up in a poor village in Nigeria and somehow struggled to obtain the skills to make them a viable candidate for Elite Employer X is a major coup.  Any company can scoop up the rich preppy kids who went to Harvard.  But &#8220;diversity recruiting&#8221; is where the real battleground is.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I have limited experience, and mostly in a rote, procedural environment. So take that FWIW. Nonetheless, there was still some talking about &#8220;thinking different&#8221;. So here it goes:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not JUST about racial diversity. In every company I&#8217;ve been at, we&#8217;ve had mandatory diversity training. They&#8217;ve emphasized that racial diversity is illegal, but they still want to encourage diversity of thought. Several times they have specifically mentioned introversion as an example. So, they acknowledge that racial diversity =! intellectual diversity, and they say they want the latter as much as they want the former. </p>
<p>However, &#8220;Think Different&#8221; is just buzzword. In most cases, culture eats strategy (and with that buzzword, I&#8217;m only 3 away from Manager Bingo!). Upper management and middle management like the <i>idea</i> of diversity&#8230;but honestly, I think it&#8217;s because their expectations are just too high. Their expectation is for some fresh hire with some out-of-the-box thinking (2 away!) to take a look at the best practices (1 away!) and come up with some low-hanging fruit (AND BINGO WAS HIS NAME-O!) to improve them. Like, Fresh Hire will come to my office and just come up with some brilliant new way to apply cash that no one has ever thought of before, and suddenly efficiency will jump through the roof. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s part of why these diversity examples in my college business books always seem to be marketing-based, particularly international marketing. Like, did you know Ford adverstised the Pinto in Brazil as a Pinto, even though Pinto means &#8220;tiny gentials?&#8221; Hahahahahaha, if only they had a Portuguese person on the team, #diversityisourstrength #livestrong #hopeandchange #resist #notmypresident. </p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s the reality? </p>
<p>In this case, I think it&#8217;s instructive to look where we do NOT want people to &#8220;Think Different.&#8221;</p>
<p>In my last position, we outsourced our A/R to a team in India. The US team was meant only to supervise. Now, you&#8217;d think if we wanted people to &#8220;Think Different,&#8221; this would be a GREAT opportunity! Dozens of people on the other side of the world with a cultural experience absolutely nothing like ours and no familiarity with any of our processes.</p>
<p>We did not tell them to Think Different. We had something like 4-6 hours of meetings every single day, which basically consisted of us trying to ram our Best Practices down their throats. We tried hard to change their entire culture, like getting their low-level employees to speak up on our conference calls, rather than deferring to their management structure. Except, &#8220;speaking up&#8221; wasn&#8217;t really the right word. We did not ask for their opinions. We gave them instructions. We expected &#8220;Yes&#8221; answers in return, even as we then got irritated that they reflexively answered &#8220;Yes&#8221; to everything.</p>
<p>We &#8220;wanted&#8221; them to explain their difficulties to us, and explain what they thought the priority should be. This would simply end in us lecturing them about what the REAL priorities were, how the difficulties weren&#8217;t really difficulties at all, and some added passive-aggressiveness about how stupid they were with a healthy dose of &#8220;you need to learn to think.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, these low worker drones? No, don&#8217;t &#8220;think different,&#8221; stick your nose to the grindstone. If I want your opinion, I&#8217;ll tell it to you. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s because the work really isn&#8217;t all the novel. It&#8217;s a series of set tasks. You sure as hell can <b>automate</b> some tasks, and possibly improve SOME processes. However, Worker Bees have next to no technological ability and next to no ability to work with our databases anyways, so they can&#8217;t really do much on the automation front. That work tends to be at the Director-level or above, and these people work directly with the Application Analysts, Business Analysts, Network Analysts, etc, that support the department. I could go to the IT teams myself, but on the futility scale it ranks probably a few steps below &#8220;write a letter to Trump&#8221; or &#8220;send an email to the CEO.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the process side, Worker Bees tend to ignore Chesterton Fences with reckless abandon. The Worker Bee normally has knowledge of the purpose of these Fences: they usually are not established for the Bee&#8217;s own work, but either to prevent novel situations, to ensure an audit trail, or to make things easier for another department (which the Bee may or may not interface with). Razing the fences might seem like a good idea to the Worker Bees, but it&#8217;ll unleash holy hell with other processes.</p>
<p>So basically Worker Bees have almost no useful ideas. We don&#8217;t need them to Think Different. </p>
<p>We do need them to THINK, at least a little bit. We need them to make decisions on priorities, we need them to know when they can make a decision and when they need to defer to a manager, we need them to know when an issue is stuck and they need to escalate to a manager, we need them to provide useful information to the manager without overloading the manager with useless information. </p>
<p>A good example might be, say, driving a truck. It&#8217;s not the most innovative job in the world. You&#8217;re not going to be able to 10X productivity as a truck driver. But you need to not be a complete idiot. You need to know that Wal-Mart will penalize you if you are more than 5 minutes early or late, you need to know that you can speed in certain areas and not in other areas, you need to know when it&#8217;s wayyyyyy too dangerous to drive in a blizzard and when it&#8217;s totally okay to drive, and how that might vary depending on how important your load is. You need someone who knows some basic algebra, so if they are 500 miles away and driving 60 miles an hour, they will be there in 8.33333 hours, except maybe he will need to stop and pee and eat some lunch and actually the speed limit in the city is 30 MPH and traffic is sometimes bad on I-80, so let&#8217;s call it 9.5 hours.</p>
<p>So you need a truck drive who can think at least a little bit, but throwing Einstein in that position is useless. Throwing a non-conforming disagreeable idiot in there who takes pleasure in &#8220;thinking differently&#8221; isn&#8217;t going to improve efficiency, he&#8217;s going to drive 90 MPH in a school zone while flicking off a cop, and then say &#8220;WHAT? I thought this was America!&#8221; when he gets pulled over.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&gt;some of them at least talk a good line about wanting people who “think different”</p>
<p>How different are we talking?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure they want employees who think creatively, are willing to challenge dogmas, etc. They probably don&#8217;t want employees who throw temper tantrums and show up late and make racist remarks. They need a way to filter these people out.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My office is fairly weird. We&#8217;re mostly white men, but we&#8217;ve got all sorts- hardcore conservatives, hardcore liberals, swordfighters, marathon runners, falconers, math-geeks, people-who-hate-math, readers who never stop carrying a book, people who haven&#8217;t read a book since college, people with PhDs, people who never went to college at all (in the same ranks), Mormons, atheists, reformed Jews, born-again Christians, vegans, near-obligate-carnivores, etc.</p>
<p>Our main requirement (beyond professional skills) is that people get along well with others, can joke around a bit and resolve conflicts diplomatically, that don&#8217;t get heated and defensive when pressured, etc.</p>
<p>EDIT- We are getting better about the &#8220;mostly white men&#8221; thing. Our original core was a bunch of startup-y high-risk-tolerant folks in Sacramento, CA, with a big programming skew. Since then we&#8217;ve hired at more demographically-normal rates for our region.</p>

<p>Currently if someone made a slot machine to Vegas spec, built to accept a token to allow voting (issued by staff at the voting hall with tokens tracked and votes written to a visible paper tape etc etc) they would be so much better than the standard crapware-laden-barely-working-unpatched-windows-xp-physically-insecure-Diebold-shit that seemingly gets used as standard.  </p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My understanding is that most electronic voting machines are non-networked.  As in, not on a wireless or wired network. (At least, the ones in use in my area are of that type. For more than a decade, I was an election-worker in the State of Michigan.)</p>
<p>Still hackable, but most such hacks require physical access.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Wait, has anyone serious come out with evidence voting machines were actually hacked, by Russia or anyone else? I thought the only real accusations were that Russia hacked HRC&#8217;s emails and/or the DNC, and paid trolls to spread their preferred message.</p>
<p>Also, while it may be technically simple to hack most of our voting machines, you&#8217;d need physical access to each machine individually, since they&#8217;re not connected to the internet. So you&#8217;d either need a whole lot of agents to infiltrate a whole lot of precincts, which ups the likelihood that one of them gets caught or blabs to the wrong person, or have an already-close election and successfully predict in advance a small number of precincts where hacking will change the overall election outcome.</p>

<p>No. But lots of people refer to other things vaguely in the hope that people will think there is.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I believe the bigger hacking concern is upstream of the actual polling locations, e.g. if the source code was altered at the factory. I don&#8217;t think anyone has suggested that this has happened, just that it has been proposed as a risk.</p>

<p>Case study of some old diebold machines showed that you don&#8217;t need physical access to each machine. Once one is infected poll workers distributing the settings for the next election can spread your infection to the rest. </p>
<p>1: the lock on the machine could be picked in a few seconds by a semi skilled picker, on a par with luggage locks. </p>
<p>2:Now with access to the ports it was trivial to write a virus which would infect the machine and spread to any other drives connected to it. </p>
<p>3: infected drives could then spread it to other voting machines. </p>
<p>So simply walk into the booth. Pick the lock, plug in a flash drive, unplug and close it up again. </p>
<p>The next time legit workers go around updating the machines your code infects them all, carried by the legit workers between machines. use custom code and you can avoid AV scanners.</p>
<p>Defcon had an event for this last year. Turns out some voting machines even have wifi enabled or are networked. </p>

<p>That could be true, but neither of your links supports it&#8211;do you have one that does? The two stories you link to about Defcon describe hacking by people with physical access to the machines and the only one where they mention a WiFi connection is a machine not by Diebold but by a company that has been out of business for a decade, used in &#8220;some county elections.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Murphy,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure we&#8217;re talking about the same thing.</p>
<blockquote><p>1: the lock on the machine could be picked in a few seconds by a semi skilled picker, on a par with luggage locks.</p>
<p>2:Now with access to the ports it was trivial to write a virus which would infect the machine and spread to any other drives connected to it.</p>
<p>3: infected drives could then spread it to other voting machines.</p>
<p>So simply walk into the booth. Pick the lock, plug in a flash drive, unplug and close it up again. </p></blockquote>
<p>The example that I saw when I worked as an election-inspector was:</p>
<p>A. Voter receives paper ballot<br />
B. Voter takes ballot to voting booth<br />
C. Voter marks ballot with pen<br />
D. Voter takes ballot, inside secrecy sleeve, to the Tabulator. (This it the piece of electronics that I think we are discussing as <i>voting machine that might be hackable.</i>)<br />
E. Voter inserts ballot into tabulator, which confirms whether or not the ballot was marked in a readable manner.</p>
<p>F. The entire process is supposed to be overseen by election workers who have affirmed that they are from more than one political party.<br />
At the end of the day, these worker use the keys/controls on the Tabulator to print out the voting results. The results, plus a sealed box containing ballots, are taken back to the local City/Township Clerk with a signed book of Poll Results.</p>
<p>G. If a recount is ever attempted, the boxes of paper ballots and their seals are checked, and the paper ballots are run through the tabulator again.</p>
<p>You are <b>correct</b> that the Tabulator is a piece of programmable electronics, inside a box with a lock (by appearances, easier to pick than most door-locks) and a seal (tricky, but not impossible, to bypass). If any part of the process is hackable,  it is the Tabulator.</p>
<p>But the Tabulator is <b>not inside the privacy of the booth</b> with the voter.</p>
<p>I recall that other regions/States use some form of electronics ballot with electronics that are inside the privacy of the booth. However, I&#8217;m pretty confident that even those regions do not give the Voter private access to the Tabulator/voting-machine.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Wait, that&#8217;s news?  I saw a Defcon presentation that demonstrated that three or four years ago.</p>
<p>The hard part isn&#8217;t hacking the machines, it&#8217;s hacking <i>enough</i> of the machines to affect the election and doing it without immediately getting caught.  No centralization means no one point of entry, and poor standardization means it&#8217;s hard to scale.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>IMO the bigger story is that the American political system is so unstable, that a moderately large troll farm (perhaps combined with a few judicious bribes) has a very good chance of influencing the Presidential election. Sure, this time it was Russia who got there first; tomorrow it will be China or Bosnia or the freaking Sierra Club, for all we know. Sure, nominally we still live in a democracy, but the fact that the system appears to be almost completely unmoored from reality should cause us at least some concern.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so cheap to steal the election that the side who was outspent nearly 3:1 is the only one who figured out how to do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>I mean if you want your narrative to be that red tribers and/or Russians are just <i>that much smarter</i> when it comes to computers than the blue tribe is, I could go with that too.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My worry is not that the Russians are somehow &#8220;that much smarter&#8221;, but than any rando with a troll farm can swing an election. This means that a). both major parties are about as computer-savvy as a drunken squirrel, but more importantly, b). either the number of swing voters is critically low (and thus influencing even a small number of them is effective), and/or there no longer exists a reliable mechanism for people to stay informed about the issues they care about (possibly because neither political party has any definitive platforms to speak of).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>My worry is not that the Russians are somehow “that much smarter”, but than any rando with a troll farm can swing an election. </p></blockquote>
<p>OK &#8211; but why did no other troll farms figure this out?  Why didn&#8217;t the Hillary campaign employ a rando troll farm?  Why didn&#8217;t George Soros?  Why didn&#8217;t any other foreign country who might have preferred an HRC victory (as far as I can tell, media consensus is that absolutely every foreign country <i>except</i> Russia absolutely hates Trump)?</p>
<p>It strikes me as decidedly non-credible to simultaneously argue:</p>
<p>1.  It&#8217;s very easy to steal an American election (can be accomplished with a monetary cost &lt;1% of what the typical Presidential campaign spends)<br />
2.  Only Vladimir Putin was able to figure out how &#8211; nobody else ever bothered to try</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Nybbler,</p>
<p>That was a hypothetical.  My personal opinion is that <i>of course</i> Hillary tried something similar.  Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders probably did too.  Given the money and power at stake here, it&#8217;s unbelievable to me to suggest that only one side was engaged in this sort of behavior.  Especially when it&#8217;s the side that is generally assumed to be older and less tech-savvy than the other&#8230;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>These discussions seem to confuse several different things:</p>
<p>1. Hacking into voting machines to alter the results. As best I can tell, nobody has offered any evidence that that happened, although a lot of people talk as though it has, presumably in the hope that ignorant listeners will be fooled.</p>
<p>2. Illegally getting access to true information unfavorable to one side in an election and spreading it. That happened, and it may well have been done by Russians.</p>
<p>3. Doing things that are entirely legal to influence an election, such as using Facebook to persuade people that a candidate is bad,  done by foreigners. There seems to be good evidence that it happened.</p>
<p>Note that 3 was also done, openly, by Obama in an unsuccessful attempt to influence the Brexit vote.</p>

<p>So far as I know, it&#8217;s plausible. If you have physical access to an electronic device, the sky is the limit in what you can do with it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>First, voting machines are generally insecure, in the sense that when you give serious computer security experts access to those machines, they always seem to end up with a bunch of attacks that they can demonstrate at least in laboratory conditions.  </p>
<p>This is actually what you should expect.  Computer security is *hard*.  Designing a computer that will resist this kind of attack is really, really hard.  Voting machines are made by companies that have little specialized expertise in security, and they don&#8217;t have a ton of money to spend on getting things right.  And in fact, most computerized things that get exposed to computer security experts get broken&#8211;IoT devices, the internal computer networks in cars, medical devices, etc.  </p>
<p>Second, there&#8217;s a *huge* distance between hacking the machines (even with some clever hack that spreads through all the machines) and altering the vote totals in the election.  Pretty much every jurisdiction (sometimes states, sometimes counties) has different technology and customizations and different procedures, which makes your job (as an attacker) a lot harder.  (Consider your software QA problem.)  I&#8217;m not claiming this is insurmountable, but it&#8217;s not enough to just find a way to hack the machine, even for the crappiest DREs&#8211;you still need to figure out how to get your attack to work, and not to trigger on any testing done on the machines.   </p>
<p>Further, you need to make your attack fairly subtle&#8211;if all the Diebold DREs in the country give 100% of their votes to the libertarian candidate in 2020, nobody&#8217;s going to believe the result and they&#8217;ll reverse it in court.  Realistically, you can probably shift the vote by a few percent without it being obvious.  This is actually a common pattern&#8211;if you want to tamper with an election by, say, &#8220;cleaning&#8221; the registration database in a way that gets rid of more legitimate voters on the other side than on your side, or you want to mess around with poll opening/closing times to depress turnout in the other side&#8217;s precincts, or you want to pay homeless people to vote under dead peoples&#8217; names in some precinct, you&#8217;re going to be able to move the vote totals a little bit, but you&#8217;re not going to be able to change a clear victory for one side into a victory for the other side without being really obvious.   </p>
<p>Finally, and most importantly IMO, most states now use voting technology that includes some kind of paper trail.  (<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Voting_methods_and_equipment_by_state" rel="nofollow">This link</a> gives a listing of election technology in different states.)  </p>
<p>DREs are just computers that ask you what your votes are and count them.  They&#8217;re the most vulnerable to software-only attacks, but they&#8217;re also pretty rare at this point, because we&#8217;ve had like a decade plus of computer security experts pointing out how vulnerable they are.  </p>
<p>Some DREs have a paper trail&#8211;usually a receipt-type printer bolted on the side.  You make your selections on the screen and then eventually the printer prints out the same selections on the paper, and you can look at them.  </p>
<p>A lot of the DREs with paper trails are really badly designed and hard for voters to check well, but they *do* put a limit on how much fraud you can engage in&#8211;either you leave a paper trail that contradicts your electronic records, or you print a different thing on the paper than you put on the screen and leave the chance that the voters will notice.  </p>
<p>For optical scan ballots (human-marked ballots that get scanned electronically and counted), you&#8217;ve got very clear human-readable  ballots that can be recounted if there&#8217;s a question about the electronic totals.  A software-only attack can change the electronic totals, but as soon as someone smells a rat and gets a recount done, this gets detected and we can get the correct result by hand counting.  </p>
<p>For mail-in or paper ballots, again, you&#8217;ve got human-readable, human-countable ballots.  They&#8217;re probably machine counted by default, but you can always do recounts.  </p>
<p>All those systems really need some kind of automatic random recounts as part of their procedures, to keep the systems honest.  But even without them, the power of a software-only attack is pretty limited by the existence of the paper trail.  </p>
<p>The result of all this: I don&#8217;t believe that outsiders (Russians, Chinese, Israelis, Germans, whatever) tampering with our voting software have any serious chance of changing the election outcome.  I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a realistic threat.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>So far as I know, it’s plausible. If you have physical access to an electronic device, the sky is the limit in what you can do with it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The same is true of mechanical devices, like ballot boxes.  Yes, even ones with &#8220;tamper-proof&#8221;seals.  </p>
<p>Election security absolutely cannot depend on assuming that your voting hardware will remain secure even if you allow enemy agents to have physical control of it.  Fortunately, it doesn&#8217;t need to be.  Particularly with highly decentralized systems like the ones used in the United States, it is operationally infeasible for anyone to secure the level of broad access that would be required to reliably control national election outcomes without getting caught in the act.</p>
<p>But if the Russians just want to cast doubt on the US electoral process and so damage the legitimacy of the US government whomever the winner turns out to be, they can do that easily enough and without hacking a single voting machine.  For that goal, the number of voting machines hacked is absolutely irrelevant, what matters is the number of useful idiots running around shouting &#8220;It is <i>technically possible</i> that the Russians hacked our election machines!  Be Afraid!  Be Very Afraid!&#8221;</p>
<p>You are answering the wrong question, to the advantage of the adversaries of the United States.  Are you sure that&#8217;s what you meant to do?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Is the accusation that Trump is a stooge of the Russian government? </p>
<p>Or that the Trump campaign engaged in back-channel negotiations with foreign spies in an attempt to dig up dirt on Hillary Clinton?</p>
<p>Or that a foreign agent, likely from Russia, tried to use the &#8220;we have dirt on HIllary&#8221; approach to request special promises from then-candidate Trump?</p>
<p>Or is the accusation that the Russian government finds it useful to cast doubt on the validity of the American electoral process?</p>
<p>On that last front, the Russian government may be succeeding.</p>
<p>The counter-accusations appear to be that the Clinton campaign and/or the Obama Executive Office used allegations of some of the above as a reason to use USGov counter-intelligence agencies against some of the officials of then-candidate Trump. (I&#8217;m not clear whether the phone-tapping that was approved also included retro-active access to call-data/call-metadata/text-messages.) This may, or may not, have involved the FBI treating a political-opposition-research company, and its documents, as the only source of the above allegations. (The political-opposition-research company, known as FusionGPS, tried to hide who had paid for the research&#8230;best information I have is that the research was paid for by a law office that was working for the Hillary Clinton campaign.)</p>
<p>There is a side-order of claims that Federal investigators deciding the results of the Hillary Clinton private-email-server investigation before they finished the investigation. And of FBI agents using their text messages to discuss some sort of &#8220;insurance policy&#8221; against the possibility of Trump winning the campaign.</p>
<p>And there is another potential foreign-collusion scandal. Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, may have accepted donations to the Clinton Foundation as <i>quid pro quo</i> for her signing off on the sale of many Uranium mines in the U.S. to the Russian company known as Uranium One.</p>
<p>My opinion is that neither political campaign has clean hands in this. And it is also my opinion that the FBI has been doing some internal house-cleaning. (Have you noticed how many FBI officials have resigned or been re-assigned to different roles in the past few months?)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Above, David Friedman breaks the situation up into three categories. Using those as a starting point:</p>
<p>1. Russian hacking of voting machines: there&#8217;s no evidence that this happened, and it is not a major element of the ongoing story. (It is independently true that many / most current voting machines are woefully insecure, and steps should be taken to prevent future hacking.)</p>
<p>2. Illegally getting access to true information unfavorable to one side in an election and spreading it: this definitely happened. There is solid evidence that Russian groups were behind it. (<a href="https://twitter.com/pwnallthethings/status/816621553643294720" rel="nofollow">For example</a>, the infrastructure set up to phish John Podesta&#8217;s account was reused to attack a large number of other targets of clear interest to Russia.) Similar things have also taken place in other countries: for example, during the French presidential runoff between Macron and Le Pen, the <a href="https://www.snopes.com/2017/05/10/french-election-russian-hack/" rel="nofollow">Macron campaign&#8217;s emails were hacked and released shortly before the vote</a>. In all the cases I&#8217;m aware of, the side that says mean things about Putin has come under attack, and the side that says nice things has not: for example, Marine Le Pen supported Russia&#8217;s control of Crimea.</p>
<p>3. Facebook propaganda campaigns: This definitely happened. Notably, this part of the campaign was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/us/politics/russia-2016-election-facebook.html" rel="nofollow">non-partisan</a>: the ads are a weird mishmash of pro-Trump, pro-Bernie, pro-cop, pro-BLM, and so on. It looks like the goal was to encourage partisan polarization and get people worked up, rather than to support any particular candidate. (My favourite example: the Russians <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/3kvvz3/russian-facebook-trolls-got-people-to-protest-against-each-other-in-texas" rel="nofollow">allegedly organized</a> both a protest and its simultaneous counter-protest.) The troll farm is not about swaying the election to one side or another; it&#8217;s more about general disruption.</p>
<p>4. The Mueller investigation is ongoing. Mueller has proven pretty good at keeping things quiet when he wants to &#8212; see, for example, the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/01/politics/papadopoulos-timeline-events-russia-professor/index.html" rel="nofollow">three-month gap</a> after the arrest of Papadopoulos before it became public knowledge &#8212; so it&#8217;s hard to say exactly where that is. There have been a few indictments. There is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/01/17/577624204/as-trump-enters-year-two-in-office-mueller-looking-at-money-laundering" rel="nofollow">some evidence</a> that he is looking at money laundering. He is apparently looking to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/us/politics/mueller-trump-interview-russia-investigation.html" rel="nofollow">interview Trump himself</a>. There&#8217;s been lots of talk about trying to fire Mueller, but at least so far he&#8217;s been allowed to operate freely. Reading the tea leaves only gets you so far, though: people on either side will claim that Mueller&#8217;s actions prove them right, but we&#8217;ll only know for sure when he releases a report.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The Russian propaganda campaign looked like it was intended to stir shit up and make it hard for Hillary (they presumably expected her to win, just like everyone else) to govern.  This actually makes a lot more sense than trying to control the outcome of the election.  The Russians were trying to push sideways on the rope&#8211;rather than trying to sway voters toward Democrats or Republicans (where they&#8217;re playing tug-of-war alongside vast teams of people pulling on both sides), they can maybe make it harder to get anything done, or discourage voters on both sides, or whatever.  </p>
<p>This seems entirely consistent with the Trump investigation, to me.  The Russian government may have offered dirt to Trump&#8217;s associates with the hope of causing more trouble in the election and subsequent Clinton administration than they could do by leaking it to Wikileaks or putting it on their own websites or on RT.  Now that Trump&#8217;s in power, they presumably are just fine with lots of information about that coming out and undermining Trump&#8217;s ability to govern (such as it is).  A war between the president and the intelligence community, a large chunk of the population convinced the deep state has railroaded their guy out of the white house, reflexive suspicion on the FBI/NSA/CIA by Republicans&#8211;all that&#8217;s probably a pretty good outcome, from a Russian government perspective.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Agreed; from Putin&#8217;s point of view, there&#8217;s very little downside.</p>
<p>1). Stir shit up, Hillary wins: it becomes hard for her to govern. The USA is destabilized. Russia can now act with some degree of impunity.<br />
2). Stir shit up, Trump wins, he&#8217;s now in your debt: even better, you can extract concessions directly.<br />
3). Stir shit up, Trump wins, he&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t care about you: Same as (1), only more so, since now you&#8217;ve got an incompetent leader in charge.</p>

<p>This is actually my biggest problem with the Russian hacking narrative.  There is clear evidence that the Podesta hack was carried out by Russians, but the worst thing to come out of the Podesta hack was Pizzagate, which convinced absolutely no one who did not already believe Hillary Clinton was a lizard person of anything.  What is the evidence that the Russians had anything to do with the DNC hack?</p>
<p>(That&#8217;s not just a rhetorical question, by the way.  If anybody knows what that evidence is, I&#8217;d love to hear it.  It&#8217;s just that nobody is talking about it, for whatever reason.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not saying the Mueller/Russia stuff won&#8217;t go anywhere. There might be campaign finance violations &#8211; either taking in-kind contributions from foreign nationals, or plain old embezzlement and misuse of funds. If not, well, Trump is certainly short-sighted enough to obstruct justice where there&#8217;s no underlying crime. But it won&#8217;t get him out of office, and all the hacking stuff is nonsense.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Most of my fellow Democrats are still in denial,</p></blockquote>
<p>This, and in a most self-destructive way where their last, best hope is to fail.</p>
<p>There are plenty of avenues of attack available against Trump, most of which lead to an ineffectual Trump presidency and Democratic wins in Congress 2018 and the White House 2020.  The &#8220;Impeach Trump because Russia&#8221; attack is almost certainly not going to be a winner, because the evidence isn&#8217;t going to be there for anything more than taking down some of his staff.  But the attack will encourage ambivalent Republicans to defend &#8220;their&#8221; man, the failure will make Trump look stronger and the Democrats weaker, and in the unlikely event that Mueller comes through with something impeachment-worthy&#8230;</p>
<p>Welcome President Mike Pence.  Or maybe Paul Ryan.  Either way, a <i>competent</i> Republican with a mandate to avenge Trump and strike down the Democrats and whatever &#8220;cuckservatives&#8221; crossed the aisle to impeach him.  Way to go, Democrats.</p>
<p>Or do they still believe that somehow, Mueller + Russia &#8211; Trump somehow adds up to President Hillary Clinton?</p>

<p>A lot of Trump&#8217;s sharpest critics would be fine with that.</p>
<p>They certainly don&#8217;t <i>like</i> his policy, but, although I&#8217;ve heard stuff like &#8220;if you take down Trump you have to take down Pence too&#8221; here and there, I don&#8217;t get the impression that it&#8217;s in the driver&#8217;s seat.  They don&#8217;t like him because he&#8217;s rude and crass, and probably most importantly because he drips contempt for conventional standards of political delicacy.  And in terms of long-term <i>strategy</i> this might not be as short-sighted as it seems: Trump&#8217;s not getting a lot done directly, but as long as he&#8217;s in office he proves that candidates can buck those standards and get away with it, which removes one of the strongest weapons from the Democratic arsenal.</p>
<p>Even if it is that short-sighted, though, I think a lot of people would be willing to give up some policy wins for a return to &#8220;normalcy&#8221;.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Agreed: The path to victory for Democrats runs directly through the 2018 midterms, and the 2020 presidential election. Of the angles of attack that can be used against Trump, Russia does not appear to be a particularly strong one.</p>
<p>Disagreed: In the unlikely case that Mueller comes up with something potent enough to get Senate Republicans to vote Trump out of office, the resulting GOP civil war has got to be good for Democrats. Trump&#8217;s base will be incandescently angry, sure, but Trump&#8217;s base is not enough to win an election on its own. Gerald Ford was not a powerful president; why should we expect a more powerful Pence?</p>

<p>It wouldn&#8217;t just be Trump&#8217;s base.  Everyone who even leans Republican will see a not-bad Republican incumbent faced with a Democratic challenger whose campaign slogan is almost certainly &#8220;Now it&#8217;s payback time!&#8221;.  They may not have liked Trump, and some of them didn&#8217;t vote for Trump, but look, Trump is gone, mission accomplished, and why rock the boat?</p>
<p>Since Trump won in without the #NeverTrump Republican votes in 2016 and with the boost to Democratic turnout that Trump incited, that pretty much has to be an electoral victory for a Republican incumbent who can keep Trump&#8217;s base on board.  Which seems to be something Trump&#8217;s VP could do.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>In a hypothetical world where 15+ Republican senators feel strongly enough about Mueller&#8217;s revelations to remove Trump from office, it is safe to assume that many moderate Republicans will feel the same way. Equivalently, but more cynically: if moderate Republicans do not feel the same way, no conceivable revelation will get 15+ Republican senators to put their necks on the chopping block and remove Trump from office.</p>

<p>Every election is decided solely by the 5-15% of the populace who <i>isn&#8217;t</i> a blind partisan.</p>
<p>The electorate tends to reward the party when things are going well, and punish the party when things are going poorly.</p>
<p>Even a good economy wasn&#8217;t enough for Al Gore to shake off the stink of having been the VP of a slimeball who got impeached.  If Trump was <i>removed</i>, the next GOP nominee, whether it was Pence, or anyone else, would lose in a landslide.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It was Hitler. Eric Harris was obsessed by the Nazis, for reasons that had much more to do with nihilism, and a psychopathic obsession with violence than any coherent political ideology.     </p>
<p>@outis </p>
<p>Around the time of Columbine the militia movement was doing a pretty good job of making right wing fringe look dangerous and frightening, so nobody would have felt the need to tar them by trying to connect the massacre to any political agenda.  </p>
<p>Though the term did not exist at the the time, the mid nineties forerunners of the alt right committed dozens of act of violence culminating in the murder of 168 people in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which stood until September  eleventh 2001 as the deadliest act of Terrorism in American history .   </p>
<p>As for Elliot Rogers, he  was not part of any political movement, but if your using &#8220;alt-right&#8221; to mean little more than racist, then his inane manifesto provides plenty of evidence for that.  As much I would rather not expose anybody unnecessarily to the mental diarrhea of this pathetic distended rectum of a human being, the following   quote is pretty representative: </p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8230;this black boy named Chance said that he lost his virginity when he was only thirteen! In addition, he said that the girl he lost his virginity to was a blonde white girl! I was so enraged that I almost splashed him with my orange juice. I indignantly told him that I did not believe him, and then I went to my room to cry. I cried and cried and cried, and then I called my mother and cried to her on the phone. How could an inferior, ugly black boy be able to get a white girl and not me? I am beautiful, and I am half white myself. I am descended from British aristocracy. He is descended from slaves. I deserve it more. I tried not to believe his foul words, but they were already said, and it was hard to erase from my mind. If this is actually true, if this ugly black filth was able to have sex with a blonde white girl at the age of thirteen while I’ve had to suffer virginity all my life, then this just proves how ridiculous the female gender is&#8230;

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Can I just say that I saw the new slogan, and immediately had to reread it, knowing there was a second &#8220;the,&#8221; that I had missed. </p>
<p>I was a little less susceptible than usual to this on the annual survey, but man it&#8217;s annoying to keep getting caught like that.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, this illusion was in a Highlights Magazine. (Look, I was a kid a long time ago, and we had magazines. On paper.) I looked for the the puzzle for about an hour, which was an eternity for me. I don&#8217;t know when I figured it out &#8211; I think I came back to it days later. </p>
<p>I have a strong eye for detail, too. My brain just doesn&#8217;t want to learn this one.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&gt; Sorry to sound a bit critical but … </p>
<p>Please do.</p>
<p>&gt; what’s the delta over the wikipedia page? </p>
<p>Wikipedia has too many examples and lots of text and things like history, how to calculate, etc. Here I try to go to the point. Wikipedia also keeps neutral, whereas after showing the current options, I point out why one seems strongly preferred.</p>
<p>&gt; And in general, there seems to be a ton of discussion out there as to why these techniques are bogus (you cite some) – so anyone who is open to hearing this probably already has.</p>
<p>Many people seem to be mostly unaware of the problem. So this helps those.</p>
<p>Other are aware but think it&#8217;s just a matter of fixing the &#8220;right threshold&#8221;. Over there, I try to show that the problem is deeper.</p>
<p>Also, there are the undecided. They see a ton of discussion and just assume it&#8217;s all too complicated. Then they keep doing their p-values as usual. I show the options and point out why one seems superior. I also went through many of the papers and selected  to link over there some of what I considered the best.</p>
<p>&gt; Two of your ‘what you can do’ steps urge people to insist on ‘proper methodology’ but here, crucially, you don’t have any citations or pointers.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right, and that&#8217;s intentional. The focus of the page is to remove what doesn&#8217;t work. Suggestion of what to do instead is a separate matter. Read the second Trafimow quote. And to paraphrase Cohen (1994): &#8220;First, don&#8217;t look for a magic alternative to NHST, some other objective mechanical ritual to replace it. It doesn&#8217;t exist.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; (N.b. if there is a ‘proper methodology’ that has a hope of usurping p-values and s.s., you’ve missed the most important target in your list of “if you are a …” recommendations: the statistics teaching profession, who should surely appreciate all your arguments as well as anyone, should then universally stop teaching p-values and statistical significance altogether (because the arguments are compelling), and teach these proper methodologies right from stats 101. Why aren’t they?)</p>
<p>Thank you, ALEF. Professors should be on that list. I will add that. </p>
<p>For what <i>the</i> proper methodology is, have a look at Gigerenzer &amp; Marewski 2015 linked there.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>So what do you recommend instead of p values?</p>
<p>The biostatisticians at my institution prefer 95% CI and effect size, but that doesn&#8217;t seem substantially different than reporting p value and effect size. It&#8217;s a bit easier to interpret and conveys a bit more information but seems like a small difference to justify making such a big stink.</p>
<p>Bayes factors seems interesting but using Bayesian statistics runs into the problem of choosing prior probabilities. I don&#8217;t trust scientists not to  fudge by <a rel="nofollow"href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/02/if-its-worth-doing-its-worth-doing-with-made-up-statistics/">using made-up statistics</a>. The only way I would support moving over to a Bayesian standard would be if it came with  commitment to employing <strike>the Principle of Indifference as the accepted method of generating priors.</strike> <i>objective Bayesian statistical inference</i>.</p>
<p>Edit: My previous statement was too strong. While the PoI is a great heuristic, here are other forms of information which can be justifiably used. The important point is that it&#8217;s not up to the whims of individual researchers but set by some established procedure.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Here&#8217;s a non-answer.<br />
  There&#8217;s no valid alternative to p-values, and never will be, if you want the same or similar utility. People learning statistics come away thinking (which hey, is what they wanted in the first place!) that there&#8217;s all sorts of useful stuff the field can give you as deterministic_function(&#8220;a few basic properties of your domain&#8221;, &#8220;your data&#8221;). Turns out that this isn&#8217;t possible, and nothing within a million miles of it is possible. &#8220;p-values&#8221; that the ilk say it is, but an honest alternative is going to seem so complex and so limited that no one will (or given institutional incentives, could) care. We are stuck with &#8220;statistics&#8221; as &#8220;reading rabbit entrails&#8221; for a long time.</p>

Something like the concept of the inevitability of conflict due to inherent tragic flaws versus that of capricious circumstances afflicting mostly innocent people, with the possibility of sudden amelioration.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Cohen_(adventurer)" rel="nofollow">Moishe Abraham &#8220;Two-Gun&#8221; Cohen</a> was a London juvenile delinquent born to Polish Jewish immigrants. Said parents shipped him off to Western Canada in his late teens in hopes that farming and cow-punching would reform him. Becoming a gun-slinging, gambling cowboy stereotype, he made friends with the local Chinese community when he beat up a man robbing a Chinese restaurant and hurled him into the street. His Chinese friends invited him to join the Tongmenghui, Sun Yat-Sen&#8217;s resistance movement to replace the Qing Dynasty with Chinese Democracy. These connections would lead to Cohen moving in with Sun Yat-Sen as his bodyguard in 1922, but first he had to go fight in World War I and almost get killed at the Third Battle of Ypres&#8230;</p>

<p>I think that the remaining people would be richer if there were fewer people. Whatever proportion of doctors, nurses, builders, we need can be maintained,  but with more space and resources for everyone.<br />

<p>I suppose with respect to space and peace of mind as resources, in some ways things have become cheaper.<br />

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Unlikely. You are wildly exaggerating the magnitude of predictable effects of climate change. Making Minnesota as warm as Iowa, which is about what the IPCC projection for the end of the century amounts to, is not going to kill hundreds of millions of people.</p>
<p>The latest estimate I saw of the effect on human welfare of warming of 2.5°C was that it was about equivalent to losing one year of economic growth.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>1) Climate in itself is a highly unpredictable thing.<br />
2) I think you understand that global warming is not only about warming.<br />
3) I heard that the latest (+-10 years) natural disasters in some parts of the world possibly were caused (strongly correlated with) by changing climate. But I cannot firmly prove the truth of those claims &#8217;cause I didn&#8217;t dig the papers on the topic.<br />
4) Sometimes it&#8217;s may be better to exagerrate for laypeople. Sure, people driven by fear is not a good option to begin with. But are rational arguments so convincing for the majority? I doubt it. We might combine emotional and rational arguments though.</p>

<p>That sounds like a recipe for disaster (no pun intended). Does it generalize? How many other public debates do we get to do this for?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Sometimes it’s may be better to exagerrate for laypeople.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other commenters have pointed out some problems with that. But there is another and perhaps less obvious problem.</p>
<p>On an issue like climate, nobody knows enough to form an opinion based only on his own first hand knowledge. Each specialists is looking at his bit of the issue, using as some of his inputs what he believes other specialists have found. If the position you argue for is accepted as the norm, each of them has an incentive to slant the results he reports&#8211;in particular, to avoid reporting anything that could be quoted as evidence against the orthodoxy he wants laypeople to believe.</p>
<p>Since everyone is doing that, including the people whose work feeds into his, the result may be that he believes in an orthodoxy that isn&#8217;t true. </p>
<p>One way of looking for such an effect is to look for patterns in false predictions. Some time back, after observing that people on each side of the climate dispute claimed the IPCC was biased for the other side, I tried the experiment of looking at each of the early IPCC reports and seeing what, on the basis of that, I would predict for global temperature thereafter. I reported the results <a href="http://daviddfriedman.blogspot.com/2014/03/have-past-ipcc-temperature.html" rel="nofollow">on my blog</a>.</p>
<p>They projected high four times out of four, twice by a lot.</p>
<blockquote><p>2) I think you understand that global warming is not only about warming.</p></blockquote>
<p>Correct. In particular, the effect we can predict with most confidence is due not to warming but to the increase in CO2 concentration that causes warming&#8211;the effect of CO2 fertilization on agricultural yields.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&gt; That’s when average world birthrate is expected to go under average world death rate.</p>
<p>I never know what to make of this. I assume you are referring to the global decline in fertility, particularly as societies become wealthier.  By now this just seems to be a fairly robust fact about the modern world so, granted continued progress in the world, we should really expect global birthrate to fall near/below replacement in the foreseeable future. I guess any long term demographic projection has to be approached with caution, but this would seem to be backed strongly by the evidence. (Furthermore, it&#8217;s a really nice thing to believe IMO; it makes the future look much brighter if Malthus never arrives.)</p>
<p>And yet &#8230; where is evolution in this? Wealthier societies with a reasonable safety net will today allow one to have a large number of &#8216;successful&#8217; (live to adulthood) children, and even if your life in doing so isn&#8217;t a fulfilling one, the selective edge of (say) 5 offspring vs 1 or 0 is seems huge. Even if biology can&#8217;t do much over 5 or 6 generations (even against this pressure?) why shouldn&#8217;t we expect highly-fertile sub-cultures to utterly prevail over a hundred year timespan? I think there probably is a reason why not, or this would be more apparent already, but I&#8217;d like to understand it better: <i>why</i> is the evolutionary argument not right/compelling?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>OTOH, there almost certainly is something like a genetic resistance to certain memes. I expect that in the long run, resistance to anti-natalist ideas will be bred out of the human population. The memetic plague of anti-natalism is particularly pronounced in our time, but I expect that a substantial minority of us will make it through this evolutionary bottleneck.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The gripping hand is, however, that resistance to today&#8217;s memes does not imply resistance to tomorrow&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Whatever survives, survives &#8211; meaning that whatever memetics color our brains in the future will be perfectly adapted to filling whatever emotional or physical need that evolution cranks up.</p>
<p>That is the real kicker; memes flourish best exactly when they redirect and &#8220;fulfill&#8221; evolutionary drives.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m still <i>sincerely</i> puzzled by my original question, but your short answer doesn&#8217;t enlighten me. There are memes (certain religious beliefs, others) than encourage high fertility. Even if we take biology off the table (and a 5:1 selection ratio, or more extreme, is this definitely right?) why isn&#8217;t there a huge selection pressure to high fertility beliefs.</p>

<p>Because two people spending their effort converting people to their meme is more efficient than two people spending their effort producing more people for their meme, and memes are penalized for complexity (or rather, complexity doesn&#8217;t reproduce well).</p>
<p>Breeding memetics are the herbivores of memetic evolution.  Conversion memetics are carnivores.  The metaphor works  right down to running into trouble when they run out of herbivores to eat.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Why do you say that having many offspring gives people a selective edge?  It doesn&#8217;t.  Offspring are not the parents.  And my existence grants absolutely nothing to my distant ancestors &#8211; who are all still dead and who all still spent a great deal of their lives seeing that their children would thrive, partially in the hope that their children would take care of them in their old age.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you&#8217;re seeing this as a cultural selection or a personal selection, the below analysis should still stand &#8211; cultures and people both change, even in isolation, which they aren&#8217;t.  At a minimum technology and environment forces that change:</p>
<p>I see in this a balance between two kinds of egocentrism: 1) Time for one&#8217;s self, spent on one&#8217;s self (and possibly partner) &#8211; this includes siloed work at one&#8217;s company. 2) Identifying kids as an extension of one&#8217;s self, and thus having them.</p>
<p>There is a tension between 1 &amp; 2, and the balance changes as means of living change.  Too much of an emphasis on 1 used to mean having no support in one&#8217;s old age, or against one&#8217;s enemies. In many ways having children now adds to burdens far more than it takes away from burdens (children are no longer co-workers with the parents, and making older siblings take care of younger [ala <i>19 kids</i>] is beginning to be seen as unfair behavior, and also may have a negative impact on those kids&#8217; own children #s).  And since children are now far less likely than prior centuries to follow in the same work or beliefs as their parents, that form of egocentrism is weakening.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t understand your comment.<br />
  I don&#8217;t have any idea what it means that a person has a selective edge. But I assume (perhaps this is where we differ -?) that the desire to have (and then love/support) children has a significant genetic component. I imagine a genetic situation that encourages someone to have as many children as they can, regardless of one&#8217;s &#8220;self&#8221; situation. Nowadays, in a western society, those children have a solid chance at thriving no matter what else your life is like. Why aren&#8217;t these genetic (or memetic) cases being selected for with a pressure rarely seen before in nature?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&gt; They are. Where are you getting the idea that they aren’t?</p>
<p>Because today&#8217;s western societies just aren&#8217;t growing that much in size, especially after removing net immigration. Imagine a gene (or meme) that urge one to have as many children as possible. Given that society will support all those children, how long or short should it take before we (credibly! evidenced!) hear  that &#8220;those people&#8221; will dominate our future. But there doesn&#8217;t seem to be such. O.k. you say, we haven&#8217;t waited long enough &#8230; ??? &#8230; but we&#8217;ve see at least three generations where a 5:1 selection ratio is a lower bound (on the metric:- there are no effective resource constraints; breed as much as you  can and your children will all be viable). Everything I know says we should be facing Malthus. In reality, it&#8217;s not so, indeed (in the west, at least) it seems emphatically the opposite.</p>

<blockquote><p>Because today’s western societies just aren’t growing that much in size, especially after removing net immigration.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed they aren&#8217;t.</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine a gene (or meme) that urge one to have as many children as possible. Given that society will support all those children, how long or short should it take before we (credibly! evidenced!) hear that “those people” will dominate our future.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://infogalactic.com/info/Amish#Population" rel="nofollow">Amish</a> were already mentioned by Douglas Knight. </p>
<p> They definitely have a pro-natalist memeplex, and given that they allow free exit, and only 20% or so leave the Amish (), I expect that they have plenty of genetic basis supporting that memeplex. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying they will actually do it, because I&#8217;ve no ability to look into the future. The Amish certainly didn&#8217;t seem to be on a road to domination a hundred years ago &#8211; but they are now, but it seems largely because they stayed the way they were, and the outside world has changed. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://infogalactic.com/info/Puritans#New_England_Puritans" rel="nofollow">New England Puritans</a> pulled off a similar feat of reproduction, but subsequently appear to have lost their memeplex. I can&#8217;t find a source, but I remember Puritan descendants being something in the range of tens of millions currently. </p>
<blockquote><p>But there doesn’t seem to be such. O.k. you say, we haven’t waited long enough … ??? … but we’ve see at least three generations where a 5:1 selection ratio is a lower bound (on the metric:- there are no effective resource constraints; breed as much as you can and your children will all be viable).</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what you mean. Humans aren&#8217;t like chickens, which can raise like twelve chicks per hen per year. Human reproduction is really slow. </p>
<p>The last high-fertility generation was around a hundred years ago, but society overall has fallen under replacement only about 25-45 years ago. This isn&#8217;t quite enough time to easily see the problem, given the advances in staving off death. But if you look at the <a href="https://infogalactic.com/info/Population_pyramid" rel="nofollow">population pyramids</a>, they have changed, a lot. Lots more old people, lots fewer children. </p>
<p>Additionally, high-fertility people don&#8217;t have easily-identifiable birthmarks on their forehead. You could be surrounded by high-fertility genotypes and not realize. (And at the moment, the hedonic/careerist memeplex is suppressing most of natural fertility, so it&#8217;s even less likely to spot those who would have big families in a different social environment.)</p>
<p>People who are a) natalists, b) drink their Kool-Ade, c) are resistant to social pressure to have few or no kids, are few and far between. Some countries have concentrated and organized minorities, such as the aforementioned Amish in the USA and the <a href="https://infogalactic.com/info/Haredi_Judaism" rel="nofollow">ultra-orthodox Jews in Israel</a>. But most places, there&#8217;s no organized opposition to the basic lifepath of &#8220;pursue happiness, get educated, have a career&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote><p>Everything I know says we should be facing Malthus. In reality, it’s not so, indeed (in the west, at least) it seems emphatically the opposite.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes. We probably will face Malthus eventually, but at the moment food production is so easy, we&#8217;d probably not reach it yet even if we were reproducing like rabbits.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Evolution takes time because human generations are long.</p>
<p>In 1920, there were 5 thousand Amish and 100 million Americans. Today there are 300 thousand Amish and 300 million Americans. At that relative growth rate, it will take 230 years for the Amish to become a majority.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>One interesting point Bodde notes is that the Chinese rarely offered religious justifications for law codes. Instead, laws were described as explicitly by man, for man, and, in very early sources, even a foreign innovation. The Book of Documents, for example, describes a now-extinct non-Han people who, unlike the ancient Han people, used severe punishments to order their society rather than moral example. The high god took pity on all those innocent victims of harsh punishments and wiped out these people.</p>
<p>This is also a point on which the early Daoists and Confucians agreed: Laozi says &#8220;when laws are many, thieves and robbers are many.&#8221; Confucius says &#8220;I have heard many cases, but what I want is to not need to hear cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idealized compromise with the Legalists, who wanted strict, clearly defined, evenly applied law, was to have written law but with lots of wiggle room for consideration of e.g. status differences, extenuating circumstances, the astrological desirability of meting out punishment (certain times of year, such as periods of new growth, were deemed inauspicious for harsh punishments and executions, for example).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ve noticed in the past few years a lot of <a href="https://xkcd.com/1289/" rel="nofollow">comics</a>, memes, etc. making fun of people who are concerned about big technological and/or cultural changes by essentially pointing out that culture has always been changing, before people had their eyes glued to cell phones people were worried about too much novel reading, etc. etc.</p>
<p>Historical perspective is nice antidote to alarmism, sure, as well as a good reminder how good we have it compared to people of times past in so many ways. That said, this kind of thing has really started to rub me the wrong way because it seems to support, essentially, a Hegel-Fukuyama view of history where everything that happens is inevitable and good and anyway, it&#8217;s all been done before anyway, so no need to worry.</p>
<p>But problem is this isn&#8217;t true. People can really be more or less alienated. Art and music can get worse. Culture and behavioral norms can get worse. I&#8217;m not saying go full Amish, but the idea that you would actually consider what sort of effect a new technology is going to have on a culture does not deserve to be mocked.</p>

<p>Sure, it <i>can</i>.  But if the overall historical trend has seemingly always been &#8220;things get better&#8221; then I think the extreme onus is on critics of technology to prove why <i>this time will be different</i>.  It&#8217;s not <i>just</i> that people today say &#8220;cell phones will destroy society&#8221; and before they said &#8220;newspapers will destroy society&#8221; and were wrong, it&#8217;s that the <i>exact specific criticisms</i> they have of cell phones are the exact same ones that previous generations had of newspaper.  The same criticisms of online porn are the same criticisms of Elvis Presley.</p>
<p>If you are alleging a huge shift in broad historical trends, <i>you</i> need to prove why we should take you seriously, and you damn well better have a <i>new</i> argument&#8230;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Is it really true that practices get better, or is it just that they get closer to current practices/values as they get closer to the present?</p>
<p>MLK has that famous quote about the arc of history bending toward justice.  But it might be an illusion, the way every point in an expanding universe will appear to be the center of the expansion.  Suppose we are no more likely to have the right moral values than anyone at any other time/place, and that societal moral values slowly and randomly drift over time.  Then we would expect to observe the arc of history bending toward justice.  </p>
<p>In some alternative universe, the societal moral consensus is that eating any animal or animal product is unthinkable, that slavery is a moral necessity for caring for the lesser races, and that homosexuality is a grave sin that must be stamped out at all costs.  Over time, people in that universe will note that meat eating has diminished to almost none (like cockfighting in our universe) over time, that opposition to slavery has faded out and slavery has expanded to benevolently care for all those lesser peoples who need to pick our cotton for us for their own good, and that, while people a hundred years ago tolerated a certain amount of homosexuality as kind-of open secrets, we&#8217;ve stamped out most of that stuff now, and filled the asylums and prisons with gays.  And they will see that as the arc of history bending toward justice.  &#8220;Why, do you know that in the past, there were people, apparently no crazier than anyone else, arguing that we should abolish slavery and treat the races equally?  And most of them made these &#8220;moral&#8221; arguments over dinners of cooked animals, sometimes while associating with obvious gays as though they were just normal people instead of pariahs?  What can you say&#8211;the past is a foreign country.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think this is an important potential bias to keep in mind: the fact that history tends to look more like the present the closer you get to it combined with status quo bias may give the impression you are on a morally positive trajectory at any given time.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t know when this became a moral debate.  I&#8217;m talking about life expectancy, GDP per capita, and virtually any other measurable outcome you might generally use to measure &#8220;quality of life.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you have some sort of moral system wherein the best thing is to live in the woods alone, and everyone having cell phones makes it harder for you to do that for some reason &#8211; then fine, complain away.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s hard for people to sell me on &#8220;technology is destroying society!&#8221; when virtually all of the objective measures we use to evaluate how &#8220;societies&#8221; are doing are trending rapidly upward.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Define “get better”. I don’t think anyone doubts that current technology is more advanced than previous technology and that people live longer lives with higher rates of consumption. But that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s better.</p>
<p>As far as criticism being the same, the difference in scale is massive. Maybe there were people who read so much they missed out on life’s experiences. But that’s different from nearly every person having a smartphone. The criticisms may have been similar but the situations are certainly not the same.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Do you have examples of people saying that newspapers, cell phones, and Elvis would destroy society? Did they say anything more than &#8220;destroy society&#8221;? If they said something specific, did society change in that specific way?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about those examples, but there are lots of examples where people made concrete predictions that came true. It&#8217;s just that we, today, think positively of these changes. Maybe because we adapted and there&#8217;s more to the change than the headline, or maybe it&#8217;s because we changed our morality to fit the new status quo (cf albatross).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The fact that children almost never play outside and get most of their socialization on the Internet, which from my experience and apparently a lot of scientist&#8217;s opinion is way lower quality socialization than the real thing, as opposed to our grandparents and to some degree parents generation where you could just go to the local empty lot and meet other kids to kick a ball around with, seems to me to be a provably existent and somewhat provably negative change.</p>
<p>I remember being young and hearing stories from my grandfather and reading stories from the 20s-60s about what children got to experience back then and being extremely jealous. Kids raced around in wagons and home-made wooden cars back then, I was lucky if I spoke to another person outside of school more than once every few months!</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s certainly both to some extent or another, though I think &#8220;insanely overprotective&#8221; is unfair. I&#8217;m a parent now, but I was raised to believe &#8220;stranger danger&#8221; and all that stuff, and even though I kind of unlearned it later in life there are a lot of other external enforcement mechanisms &#8212; social and otherwise &#8212; that keep it intact for many people of my generation. Add to this that the availability of screens in all their forms also lowers the cost to parents of keeping kids inside.</p>
<p>(With no computer in the house and none of our 13 TV channels being of interest to us kids most of the day, our mom would have been driven crazy if my brothers and me were kept in the house all day.)</p>
<p>So my basic point is, I agree parents keep their kids inside too much, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s because parents are insane and overprotective.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I agree, that&#8217;s part of it. But I&#8217;m saying another part of it is that keeping your kids inside in front of screens is kinda shitty, but it isn&#8217;t that crazy &#8212; and I say that with a solid record of ludditism, smartphone-hating, and instincts toward free-range parenting styles, at least where play is concerned.</p>
<p>Technology lowers the cost of keeping your kids inside. It&#8217;s a pulling force.</p>
<p>Another factor might be divorce: with no fathers around (and sometimes even with), moms don&#8217;t have the confidence to let their kids roam, so the natural maternal neuroticism overpowers the more rational tendencies.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Agreed.

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Chiming in for further agreement. If you look for them, there are *definitely* multiple readily obtained examples of things getting worse, culturally. </p>
<p>Fall of Rome -&gt; Middle Ages.<br />
Amarna -&gt; post-Amarna Egypt (?)<br />
Any of several transitions in China<br />
Greenland nordic community pre-collapse =&gt; post-collapse</p>
<p>There are also really persuasive examples of specific technologies nowadays that were really harmful. (E.g. lead in gasoline) and unexplained bad trends that might relate to technological change (why is everyone fatter?) and kinds of technological change that seem almost assuredly must have some costs, but whose costs are the kind nobody can be bothered to find, because that tech is a ship that has sailed and can&#8217;t be recalled. (does radio/cell phone/etc radiation mess with our bodies? Does widely available pornography mess with social cohesion and result in Nash equilibria where anomie and alienation are inevitable for thinking people? Maybe there&#8217;s no point in anyone researching these questions, because we&#8217;re not putting these genies back in their bottles.) Is the right description of the service Facebook provides is &#8220;It captured your network and everyone else&#8217;s, and is leasing our network back to us, where the rental price is the price of navigating an algorithmic interface aimed at maximizing addictiveness/advertising effectiveness.&#8221; </p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth thinking about these things and, where possible, aiming to coordinate a little to have that better, more deliberate life.</p>

<p>A.  How do the problems associated with lead in gasoline compare to a counterfactual wherein gasoline was not invented until an unleaded version could be worked out?</p>
<p>B.  Similar.  As a hypothesis, perhaps everyone is fatter because food is no longer meaningfully scarce.  Fatness is the price we pay for eliminating large-scale starvation.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yeah.  Gasoline engines are prone to abnormal ignition (&#8220;knocking&#8221;), which damages engines over time and causes various other problems, and which can be minimized either with some complicated engineering work on the engine or by anti-knock additives in the fuel.  Tetraethyl lead is a cheap and effective anti-knock agent that also happens to be a neurotoxin.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I wasn&#8217;t pointing at these things as definitive, just as proof that being reflective about ways technology can make things worse is a valuable. As in, otherwise we wouldn&#8217;t have noticed that lead was making us stupid and/or violent. Otherwise we wouldn&#8217;t be looking for ways to counteract any possible harmful effects of more often seeing friends via Facebook than via real life. And so on.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>However, tetraethyl lead is not the only anti-knock agent known at the time; it was known at the time that ethanol blends also have reduced knock. The standard story would have it that tetraethyl lead was used partly because the oil industry was hostile to ethanol (presumably because an ethanol blend includes less gasoline, and they didn&#8217;t like the idea of reducing demand for their major product).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>A common trope in that discourse is to mention that Plato/Socrates decried the divine invention of writing:</p>
<p>&gt; If people learn this, it will implant forgetfulness in their souls; they will cease to exercise memory because they rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves, but by means of external marks. What you have discovered is a recipe not for memory, but for reminder. </p>
<p>I find it boundlessly amusing that people appear to cite this with the implication that Plato would be <i>wrong</i>.  To me it&#8217;s perfectly evident that he was obviously correct.  People have, indeed, ceased to exercise their memories thanks to writing.  How many song performers do you know who could recite a whole epic comparable to the <i>Iliad</i>? (“Those guys in the Balkans”—the remainder of the <i>oral</i> tradition; my point exactly).  Hell, how many people can even recite a long-ish poem or a good section of a holy book?  How tidy is your memory palace these days? How long has it been since mnemonic aids like “in the first place” became dead idioms?</p>
<p>“But it was a price worth paying”.  Natürlich.  This is also perfectly obvious.  The kind of externalization of expertise that we&#8217;re building on the Internet is worth its price, too.  These are, nonetheless, <i>prices</i>; it&#8217;s illogical to pretend that progress is <i>just</i> progress, that nothing is ever lost.  Just compare our lifestyles to that of hunter-gathering.</p>
<p>On that note, it&#8217;s remarkable that one of the most common sacrifices demanded by the God of Progress are <i>kinds of pleasure</i>.  Roland Barthes has a snippet describing the early French tram cars: they had open train wagons at the tail, meant for cargo but also usable by people in the everyday; and going in an open wagon was a delight, a festive choice, people smiled and rode with the wind.  I had similar experiences as a child in rural Brazil, driving atop the cargo compartments of trucks and pickups, happily growing brown with dust.  These practices were, of course, incredibly dangerous and not very smart, and that they were abolished is a progress—with regards to safety.  But in terms of delight, progress took away a kind of fun in transportation.  It gave us new ways of enjoy (e.g. a 3DS), but ate those old ones.  It appears to me to be nonsensical to claim that the average Westerner has <i>more</i> fun than a Pirahã; by any neuro metric such as cortisol, dopamines etc. the Pirahã will prove to do just as well, pre-progress hardly changing from post-; progress give us new delights while destroying others, in matters of fun we have &#8220;change&#8221; more than &#8220;progress&#8221;.  For those who miss <i>the specific kinds of pleasure</i> of their childhood, it&#8217;s perfectly rational to feel sad that progress took them away. If you&#8217;re craving for waffles, you&#8217;ll be sad that waffles are over, even if they give you free cake in exchange. (In other metrics—e.g. the number of people who can have fun, or how long are they alive to have fun in the first place—true progress is possible.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Fatalistic and nihilistic view: things are not getting better or worse (because that doesn&#8217;t mean anything objectively), they&#8217;re just changing, they always have and always will, and adopting new technology is not actually a choice. Societies that are late in the technological game get swept away by early adopters. And once a technology is here there is no coming back. Once hunter-gatherers get a taste of agricultural life, taste cheese, alcohol, bread and cultivar vegetable, they have zero incentive to get back to the foraging life. Same for agricultural people getting a taste of the industrial life.</p>
<p>Even the Amish are not really a reversion, because to be allowed to be part of American society, they still have to use electricity and computers for a number of professional activities, and they still vaccinate their kids, use modern roads and have direct or indirect access to news and information from all around the world. They don&#8217;t live like premodern, agricultural humans, they live like poor industrial farmers in developping countries.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Onyomi says</p>
<blockquote><p>That said, this kind of thing has really started to rub me the wrong way because it seems to support, essentially, a Hegel-Fukuyama view of history where everything that happens is inevitable and good and anyway, it’s all been done before anyway, so no need to worry.<br />
&#8230;<br />
People can really be more or less alienated. Art and music can get worse. Culture and behavioral norms can get worse. I’m not saying go full Amish, but the idea that you would actually consider what sort of effect a new technology is going to have on a culture does not deserve to be mocked.</p></blockquote>
<p>You respond with nihilism and fatalism, and conclude no need to worry. </p>
<p>If I understand Onyomi&#8211;or anyway, if you want to know what was in my head when I agreed with Onyomi, well, your comment is an example of the problem being complained of. </p>
<p>I see this pretty commonly with most of the places I encounter nihilism and fatalism day-to-day. It&#8217;s not from people who are nihilistic or fatalistic in any overarching philosophical way. (As in, they still experience their lives as containing meaningful projects where effortful engagement with the problems can improve prospects of success.) It&#8217;s just knee-jerk mockery of ideas they find inconvenient as insufficiently &#8220;woke&#8221; to the meaninglessness/futility of &#8220;it all&#8221; at the same time that they plan to go right on taking convenient ideas as fertile ground for effortful pursuits and meaning. </p>
<p>So, I respond: The fact that you may have some degree of choice w/r/t/ what you do about the fact that so many of your own/your kids&#8217; friendships are only-mostly or online-only is *fact* and you do have a *choice* to make about what you do in the face of that fact, and philosophical fatalism/nihilism about meaningness can be a balm (maybe) for the general philosophical malaises that you may experience when faced with this fact, and with the limited range of options you have to respond to the fact (<a href="http://existentialcomics.com/comic/87" rel="nofollow">care bears explain philosophical malaise</a>) but it remains the case that you have a choice to make, as do the rest of us, and we don&#8217;t need to be mocked for considering our options mindfully.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I am not mocking anyone. I don&#8217;t believe in free will, so I don&#8217;t believe in choice. I trully do not believe in objective values or morality. This is not a balm or a curse. It&#8217;s just what I believe.</p>
<p>I am not saying Onyomi&#8217;s concerns are laughable (or rather, I am not saying they are any more laughable than any other kind of concern stemming from any other variety of moral realism). I am explaining why, from my point of view, this is a non-question.</p>
<p>To the question &#8220;what do we do about the disturbances brought about by technological progress&#8221;, I just answer &#8220;we do nothing, because there&#8217;s nothing to do, and because there&#8217;s no &#8216;we'&#8221;.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Heraldry in western/central Europe is an interesting example of pre-modern standardization.</p>
<p>Starting from fairly local and idosyncratic systems in the early middle ages, by the Renaissance French, English, German and Southern European heraldry had largely converged to the same inventory of tinctures (up to using the same crosshatch patterns in lieu of color when the latter wasn&#8217;t avalaible), the same spatial divisions of the coat of arms, the same rules of composition/combination, the same figures, and the same conventional written system to describe a given coat of arms unambiguously, so that a German noble reading the translated description of a Portuguese coat of arms could accuratedly picture its appearance.</p>
<p>This wasn&#8217;t *completely* standardized &#8211; there was a lot of stylistic leeway in the interpretation of a given description within the framework imposed by heraldric rules, although this was mainly equivalent to glyph/police variation in a text: just like an A was an A whether it was written in humanist or gothic script, a &#8220;lion rampant&#8221; is a &#8220;lion rampant&#8221; whether its design is extremely flowery or on the contrary very minimalistic.</p>
<p>This is speculation, but I imagine the origins of this standardization are to be found in the frequent intermarriages of the various noble families of Europe; thus the different systems were frequently exposed to each other and mixed together, resulting in a natural drive for homogenization, perhaps reinforced by coats of arms having a legal weight as a symbol of nobility, and thus many of the rules becoming enshrined into law as well, and not just local law, but into the &#8220;international&#8221; law of the time, the codes that all the monarchies came to agree upon regarding aristocratic matters.</p>
<p>This is in sharp contrast, for instance, with units of measurements, which until the industrial era often varied from province to province, sometimes even from village to village, and the standardisation of which was often brought about by sudden and authoritarian movements (the French revolution instated the metric system, which Napoleon&#8217;s conquests then propagated through Europe).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I believe they were rendered in French everywhere, as it was the <i>lingua franca</i> of the time? Even in English we adopt the French words and word  order for &#8220;lion rampant&#8221; for example.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>German wikipedia has a <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tingierung" rel="nofollow">small dictionary</a> of colors, in German, French, and English. The French and English are slightly different. They are often spelled differently, but there are some substantial differences, like Vert vs Sinope. The German is completely different, ordinary German words. I post this mainly to suggest that the prior commenters are wrong, although I&#8217;m not sure. In particular, I&#8217;m not sure the German column is intended as historically accurate technical terms, rather than modern descriptions. But <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Löwe_(Wappentier)" rel="nofollow">gelöwte Leopard and leopardierender Löwe</a> (leopard rampant and lion passant) sound like technical terms.</p>

<p>Based on this, it appears that English more or less directly adopts the French terms, other Romance language loan the French terms or translate them if there&#8217;s a close equivalent, while German and Dutch generally prefer to translate them and use native syntax rather than French one. So for &#8220;lion rampant&#8221; we get:</p>
<p>lion rampant (fr./eng.)<br />
león rampante (es.)<br />
leone rampante (it.)<br />
steigender Löwe (de.)<br />
klimmende leeuw (nl.)</p>
<p>Though borrowings do also occure in German and Dutch, as can be seen in the names of some of the tinctures:<br />
English &gt; Azure, Gules, Vert, Purpure, Sable<br />
German &gt; Blau, Rot, Grün, Purpur, Schwarz<br />
Dutch &gt; Azuur, Keel, Sinopel*, Puper, Sabel,</p>
<p>(*: borrowed from French &#8220;sinople&#8221;, which is the French heraldic term for &#8220;green&#8221;, whereas &#8220;vert&#8221; which English borrowed is the ordinary French word for &#8220;green&#8221;).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>In addition to intermarriage, you also had tournaments with knights competing from a variety of countries. That doesn&#8217;t force standardization–all you really need is the ability to recognize the members of your own team. But it does expose people of one country to the heraldry of other countries.</p>
<p>I addition, of course, a lord might have holdings in more than one country, hence want to be able to describe his device in the same way in different places.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The Olympic Mixed Doubles Curling is down to the medal round, and  (Spoilers!) the gold medal game is no surprise &#8211; reigning world champions Jenny Perret and Martin Rios of Switzerland take on Kaitlyn Lawes and John Morris of Canada. </p>
<p>Canada won the round robin game between the two handily, but it’s hard to bet against the Swiss. Canada probably has the best chance of any country to sweep (ha!) the three curling events, this will be a tough out for them. </p>
<p>The bronze medal match is first, and is between Russia and Norway.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Thanks for the link, Iain.</p>
<p>It really is mostly sweeping. People unfamiliar with curling tend to really underestimate how athletic sweeping is, and how much of a difference it can make in the shot. A curling shot covers about a hundred feet from the time of release until it stops, and might take 30 seconds to do that. During that time, you might need to be sweeping as hard as you can &#8211; pressing as much force as possible into the broom head and moving it as fast as possible. If you aren&#8217;t out of breath after a hard sweep, you could have been sweeping harder. In a 10-end game, the two lead players will repeat this 60 times. Yeah, curlers might not always look like the fine physical specimens on the speed skating track, but out of shape curlers will never be elite sweepers.</p>
<p>The ability to carry a stone an extra couple feet over your competition is a huge asset &#8211; you&#8217;ll miss less shots because there are a wider range of weights that will result in the stone coming to rest where you want it. You can shoot a wider variety of shots with lower risk &#8211; maybe you can use a good sweep to sneak around a guard and then let the rock finish with a strong curl and end up nicely buried. Sweeping can fine tune the trajectory of a take out shot &#8211; meaning that not only will you hit the target stone, but your shot rock will roll exactly where you want it. </p>
<p>Net result of that, plus the second factor (more speed while remaining in control) is that elite men have shotmaking accuracies (discussed in my last post) about 10% or a little less better than similarly elite women. That&#8217;s basically the difference between the best and worst finishing teams at The Brier (the top Men&#8217;s tournament) &#8211; and doesn&#8217;t account for the fact that the men might be attempting objectively tougher shots. </p>
<p>Of course tradition also plays a role &#8211; not only in gender segregating the sport to begin with, but also in that there may be a larger pool of men playing at a seriously competitive level, there is more money in men&#8217;s professional play (therefore more full-time curlers that support themselves with the sport), etc. </p>
<p>FWIW, when this has come up among curlers, the usual consensus is that the best women&#8217;s team would probably rank somewhere in the Top 20 of men&#8217;s teams &#8211; not nearly as far off as say tennis or golf, but not enough to be consistently competitive. </p>
<p>I will say at the club level curling is usually coed until it gets quite competitive. At this low-amateur level individual skill matters more than gender. Then again our club has plenty of interest to support one men&#8217;s only league and a few coed leagues, but no ladies&#8217; league.</p>

<p>OK. So the action plan is to:<br />
a) drastically cut refined sugar intake, since that probably sinks your testosterone a lot,<br />
b) cease porn and masturbation forthwith, since that reliably lowers sex drive and may cause erectile dysfunction.</p>

<p>How am I supposed to know? All I know is what you&#8217;ve told me, and according to my learnings, some of those things may be the cause of your loss of sex drive. If you want better advice than me helping you google this suff, I suggest visiting an actual doctor.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I would say actual doctor is the way to go if you&#8217;re having a reduction in sex drive you find unacceptable at 24. Not that any of those other things couldn&#8217;t possibly help, but unless you&#8217;re unusually sensitive to something they shouldn&#8217;t be having a dramatic effect at 24. I seem to do a decent number of things that I shouldn&#8217;t, according to previous comments in this thread, and yet have plenty of sex drive in my 40s. I&#8217;d put it down to individual variation (which seems to be huge), but you say you were fine in your teens, so I&#8217;d say you really should investigate the possibility that you&#8217;ve developed some health problem between then and now.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@DunnoWhatToDo </p>
<p>if you&#8217;d said 30&#8217;s or 40&#8217;s that would be unsurprising but if you&#8217;re a reasonably healthy early 20&#8217;s that&#8217;s a tad unusual&#8230;.</p>
<p>I mean some reduction from the teenage &#8220;holy shit my mind is filled with this all the time&#8221; levels of sex drive is normal but such reduction that it&#8217;s causing you distress is a bit more worrying. </p>
<p>re: anon, porn and masturbation are probably irrelevant except in the super-short term. Sugar consumption, while good to control also shouldn&#8217;t destroy your sex drive. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll agree with Protagoras, if it&#8217;s such an extreme dropoff that it&#8217;s distressing you it might be a sign of something you might to check out with a doctor.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>OP here. Lemme try something new here..</p>
<p>Hypothesis: my sex drive has been reduced.</p>
<p>In support of the hypothesis is my own anecdote. But my own anecdote is based on (unreliable?) memory (or perhaps comparison?) to my 19 year old self.</p>
<p>So, obviously I need to find evidence that my sex drive actually did go lower, rather than me believing that it actually did go lower. Perhaps it&#8217;s a cognitive thing?</p>
<p>Any ideas for some good tests? I&#8217;ve fired up my (inactive) facebook account and looked at pictures of girls I like, and yep, my reaction is still &#8220;hot damn, what a babe&#8221;. So I still have some. A more generalized version of this idea is to put myself in situations where people&#8217;s sex drive does fire up, and see what happens. I&#8217;ve tried imaging a situation where I get a hug from a girl, and yep, I did feel like just lifting her up in the air and sticking her up against a wall and doing all kind of fun stuff. I even got turned on a bit, to.</p>
<p>A different tangent would be that I&#8217;m more able to control it, but something doesn&#8217;t feel right about it.</p>
<p>Anything I can do to improve my hypothesis testing?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s hard to compare since now I am a married man and actually getting some on the regular, but this is closer to my experience, excluding the madness that is age 19. Anecdotally, I&#8217;d say that more sex actually leads to more libido (it probably raises your T levels or something), but it becomes much more controllable because you know where and when your next fix is coming from.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The few times my SO and I have had to do the long distance thing I&#8217;ve had a reminder of how much more sucky life is with a dialed-up sex drive. It is so so much easier to enjoy normal social events when the bit in the back of my head isn&#8217;t screaming &#8220;hey! HEY! Hey! Have you noticed that girl has amazing tits! Hey! Hey! HEY! Look at the amazing curve on those hips! HEY! HeY!&#8221;</p>
<p>The reduction from simply sleeping cuddled up with my SO grants almost zenlike inner calm by comparison.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I miss my sex drive when I was 30. I see you&#8217;re only 24. Gather ye rosebuds.</p>
<p>Probably a lot of variation between people here. At 16 I was constantly thinking about sex. Yeah, I might take it if I was married to someone with an equal drive. Otherwise, at 16, it was to the point of being a nuisance.</p>
<p>I can tell you that the really big drop in my sex drive (routinely having sex twice or more in a session to basically never doing so) happened in my mid 30s. Sucks to get old. You eventually get used to it. I am happy to say that the continuing decline from 35 to almost-50 has been quite gradual and mild in comparison.</p>
<p>You can be reasonably optimistic that sex will remain fun. I have some tendencies toward anhedonia myself. Sex, and (less so) eating still stay enjoyable even when not much else is. Maybe you should take up cooking.</p>
<p>I agree with the other guy that you might want to see a doctor if you&#8217;re sure you&#8217;ve experienced a sharp drop in drive. I also agree with the usual health recommendations here: exercise, enough sleep, not eating crap, not overstressed with responsibility.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>No. The constant erections, hours upon hours of time lost watching sexy things that I immediately lost interest in despite seeming incredibly compelling shortly before (not just porn but also bad movies with sexy parts, or even MTV spring break bikini dancing shows,) powerful urges to betray lifetime friends at the drop of a hat, not being able to enjoy the company of exclusively male friends at a get-together because &#8220;this is too much of a sausage party,&#8221; never knowing when to escalate while talking to any remotely attractive female, even in obviously inappropriate situations, always wanting to escalate things to sex as soon as possible instead of delaying things to make sure there&#8217;s a good interpersonal basis with a mate, the urge to dominate and all the side effects like driving like an asshole, not being able to pay attention in class from 13-21, sweating (god the sweating!)</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I would never be happy with celibacy or impotency; but every year libido diminishes, the better life is</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Eh, I mostly mean a lack of attraction or intimacy, not frequency. I&#8217;ve seldom felt a strong enough connection in that regard to justify permanent exclusivity or to feel capable of offering it. Never mind sexual compatibility having a tenuous relationship to other positive qualities in a spouse. If I cared less about sex, it would be easier. I could go into greater detail, but I should probably be giving up &#8220;complaining about my sex life&#8221; for Lent.</p>

<p>Some good confirmation of the cost disease posts from Angus Deaton.  And some hints at why free markets, and making them freer, as opposed to more pro business &#8211; would be better for poor people than socialism. </p>

You’ve got libertarians on one hand and left-wingers on the other hand that would agree that rent-seeking is a really bad thing. They may not agree that free market capitalism is a good thing, but they can agree on disliking rent-seeking. Maybe there’s something of a consensus to be built there</p></blockquote>

<p>I doubt it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rent-seeking&#8221; strikes me as a boogeyman phrase, like &#8220;neoliberal,&#8221; seemingly maximally designed to get everyone to agree that it sucks &#8211; even while specific examples of it in place remain popular.</p>

<p>You could not get bipartisan support on a change to any one of these three things individually.  And if we could compromise on some sort of deal where we change them all at once, we already would have.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Jumping in&#8211;the mutually reinforcing dynamic of homeowners in desirable suburbs restricting housing development to avoid newcomers to their schools, the quality of which maintains and enhances their home values. It&#8217;s a situation that both the left (wealthy suburbanites lean conservative, and it hits on economic/racial inequality) and right-libertarian (because it&#8217;s all propped up by government intervention on free markets in housing and education) sides can hate.</p>
<p>But of course, the policy answers are diametrically opposed: the left (broadly speaking) wants mandates from the state or federal government (or judiciary) that require integration across communities to level out quality and make the &#8220;opportunity hoarders&#8221; mix with the rest of society, and more money for poor-off schools. Libertarians want to liberalize land use regulations and build market-based alternatives to public schools, ruining both the means and the incentive for municipalities to restrict housing so heavily. Meanwhile, both the Republic and Democratic parties have large and influential chunks of their constituencies that benefit from the status quo and would (at least in the short term) lose out under either set of alternatives.</p>
<p>As someone with sympathies for both left and libertarian thinking, I&#8217;d love to see a compromise hammered out here, but you&#8217;re right to be cynical on the potential for consensus here.</p>

<p>I would suggest that the status quo <i>is</i> the compromise.  It gives both parties a little bit of what they want, while requiring a little bit of a sacrifice as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, nobody loves the status quo.  But they love it more than they&#8217;d love either the left-wing or the right-wing solution.</p>
<p>So like, it&#8217;s not <i>false</i> to say &#8220;the one thing we agree on is that this compromise kinda sucks.&#8221;  But at the same time, it&#8217;s not really an actionable thing that can lead to any reasonable change&#8230;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The more I think about this, the more I think I&#8217;m onto something here &#8211; not just for rent-seeking specifically, but for any sort of scenario where someone jumps up and says:  &#8220;We all agree that this situation is not ideal!  So surely there&#8217;s an easy compromise to be had!&#8221;</p>
<p>Consider that any time you are looking at something everyone views as sub-optimal, you are quite possibly looking at the <i>result</i> of a compromise, rather than the opportunity for one.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not so sure I agree on that. Suburbs are battle-grounds. Looking at the Illinois House of Representatives, I see a bunch of wealthy suburbs represented by Democrats.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, walking through my neighborhood every day, I see a LOT of &#8220;Hate Has No Home Here&#8221; and &#8220;In this House we believe in Love and Science&#8221; placards. Just looking at my precinct, HRC took a good 57% of the vote. </p>
<p>They also really hate density. So I think there are a lot of wealthy liberal suburban types that still don&#8217;t want big apartments going up next door.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>There&#8217;s certainly some pure aesthetics. Wanting to live on five acres down a long twisty unpaved road isn&#8217;t mutually exclusive with almost any ideological positions. (Some kind of extreme green maybe.)</p>
<p>But on the other hand, when the mooted apartment building isn&#8217;t literally next door, when it&#8217;s on the other side of town and you aren&#8217;t going to see it while riding around on your riding lawn mower, and the increased traffic argument is looking pretty thin given that there&#8217;s shopping closer to the proposed site in the other direction, it starts to look at lot like you just don&#8217;t want &#8220;those&#8221; kids in &#8220;your&#8221; school.</p>
<p>Which, okay, doesn&#8217;t exactly make you Adolf Hitler, but don&#8217;t go around with your nose in the air about how left wing you are. Maybe my attitude towards these guys, summed up by:</p>
<blockquote><p>The people of old Mississippi<br />
Should all hang their heads in shame<br />
I can&#8217;t understand how their minds work<br />
What&#8217;s the matter don&#8217;t they watch Les Crane?<br />
But if you ask me to bus my children<br />
I hope the cops take down your name<br />
So love me, love me, love me, I&#8217;m a liberal</p></blockquote>
<p>ends up hurting the candidates I prefer by alienating people that would rather I don&#8217;t notice their hypocrisy. But frankly, I don&#8217;t much care. I&#8217;m not a politician and it isn&#8217;t my job to figure out how to win elections.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yeah, that&#8217;s also my suspicion, Brad. Even if it&#8217;s not necessarily racial, if you&#8217;re a left-leaning individual, I don&#8217;t see why you wouldn&#8217;t want to share our pretty-good school districts with some underprivileged kids. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care if they argue against this. They moved here for the same reason I did, it has really good schools. </p>
<p>A lot of it is argument against density, just for density. The apartments going up by me are luxury condos with a combined HOA and mortgage higher than what I pay on my own house! However, the arguments preventing higher density in livable areas directly lead to higher rents, therefore pricing out lower income households (especially minority households).</p>

<p>Why do you imagine the liberals in question (as well as conservatives in the same neighborhood) don&#8217;t want poor, mostly minority kids going to their kids&#8217; school?

<p>Because then the school has to spend a bunch of money educating poor kids, which is less money for other things. Plus peer effects: now my kids are hanging out with poor kids with bad behaviors as opposed to upstanding upper middle class kids that are going places.</p>

<p>Firstly, because the quality of a school is mostly determined by the quality of the attending students.</p>
<p>Secondly, because once you add enough _really terrible_ students, you reach a tipping point where the school becomes completely ineffective due to those students actively disrupting things.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m going to have to agree with Matt M here. A focus on rent-seeking is likely a dead-end, because the faction of people opposed to it in principle is extremely small. This is because the Left and Libertarians both want to use rent to increase their share of wealth.</p>
<p>On the Left: Rent-seeking is the basis for welfare, using the government to transfer wealth from one person to another. The Left is absolutely opposed to the concept of structuring our economy so that only producers receive wealth, hence their support for things like CHIP, Medicaid, public schooling, ect.</p>
<p>Libertarians: A significant blind spot in libertarian discussions against rent-seeking, is that <i>the seeking of rent is rent-seeking behavior</i>. Land rent is, at its most  basic, an increase in wealth that is independent of wealth creation. The current libertarian trend of trying to divorce &#8220;the seeking of rent&#8221; from &#8220;rent-seeking behavior&#8221; is not  convincing. So unless libertarians want to abolish one of the fundamental powers of private property ownership, they are stuck with economic rent.</p>
<p>In addition, the concept of &#8220;rent-seeking&#8221; itself is mired in quasi-LTV philosophical ambiguity. Is the rent you pay to your landlord really &#8220;rent&#8221;? After all, he does&#8230;something every month, right? (Driving to the bank to cash checks is work!) And why is regulatory capture necessarily considered &#8220;rent-seeking&#8221;, if the industries are still are adding wealth to the economy? Do we have to compare it to a (wholly hypothetical) non-rent-seeking baseline to determine if its less productive than it could be?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I wonder whether procreation would actually slow in that case.</p>
<p>I mean, if we&#8217;re curing natural aging, physical decrepitude and senility, a silly issue like menopause doesn&#8217;t sound like a problem for the medicine to get around. In the long run, I would expect that in a situation where the only causes of death are disease, accident and homicide, the population would be increasingly genetically predisposed towards extreme natalism. Just because they&#8217;re the ones having a kid every one or two years, and intend to continue doing that as long as they live.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>What are you talking about? Don&#8217;t you mean <i>after</i> radical life extension? As per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy" rel="nofollow">wiki</a>, world-wide life expectancy at birth was 31 years in 1900 and 71.5 in 2014. &#8220;During the 20th century, despite a brief drop due to the 1918 flu pandemic[41] starting around that time the average lifespan in the United States increased by more than 30 years, of which 25 years can be attributed to advances in public health.&#8221; </p>
<p>You&#8217;re living in the radical life extension era <i>right now</i>. </p>
<p>Also, what bugmaster said.</p>
<p>Perhaps more helpfully: Lots of people use religion to deal with their fear of death, and it seems to work well for many of them. They tend to go for some form of eternal life (in &#8216;heaven&#8217;) instead of just some more decades on Earth. Religious approaches also allow you a lot more flexibility in terms of the desirable end state conceived and are generally culturally conceived of as much harder to &#8216;disprove&#8217;, and address many concerns and issues which might be relevant in a life extension context (issues of affordability and access, for example).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That&#8217;s not so much &#8220;life extension&#8221; as &#8220;preventing diseases from killing a whole lot of infants&#8221;. Advances in life expectancy at adulthood have been <a href="https://www.infoplease.com/us/mortality/life-expectancy-age-1850-2011" rel="nofollow">much more modest</a>. </p>
<p>The current state of the art isn&#8217;t life extension per se, but rather incremental advances in fighting unnatural causes of death. I think OP is after stuff that would extend natural human lifespan from the 120ish limit, possibly even extending the amount of time you have on the Earth before senile decrepitude sets in.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yeah, when you look at the nitty gritty, things aren&#8217;t as encouraging as would be suggested just by looking at the progression of average life expectancy.  </p>
<p>Basically, modern medicine is helping more and more people to live closer to the natural limit, which is a great thing.  But must people understand &#8220;radical life extension&#8221; to mean a great deal more than that.  For me, it means that maintaining the human body is like maintaining an automobile, i.e. you can keep it running literally forever if you have the money for replacement parts and fuel.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s iffy enough at the moment that it&#8217;s easy to ignore and instead compare yourself to the poor unfortunates who were born before the 20th century.</p>
<p>But one can imagine a situation where an anti-mortality pill comes out but it&#8217;s initial price is prohibitive for 90% of the world&#8217;s population.  That would be psychologically difficult for a lot of people, perhaps enough so that the world&#8217;s governments step in and force/subsidize the supply to be dramatically increased.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think there is an issue here of people, including you, having differing assumptions as to what will or will not kill them which they falsely assume to be universal.</p>
<p>You seem to assume that we will develop anti-aging technology, but it won&#8217;t be in your lifetime (correct me if this is wrong, please).</p>
<p>Burgmaster seems to doubt that such technology is even possible, and I know others do, too.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I would argue that if you are below 40, you are already unlikely to die of aging, and much more likely to die via human extinction.</p>
<p>So you might want to list your assumptions before asking these kinds of questions, and limit responses to people who agree. But if you actually believe what I ascribed to you here, my advice as to how to deal with it is: buy a cryonics insurance and hope that things work out.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Probably to the normal hodge-podge (what you get when you&#8217;re a Catholic convert who spent time in the Episcopal world and has Orthodox friends.)  Also note-I&#8217;m very intolerant of dairy, so I will avoid it, but I do that year-round.</p>
<p>No meat except on Sundays.<br />
Vegan on Fridays, probably most Wednesdays.  (My goal is more days vegan each week than days with meat.)<br />
No sugar (what we chose as a family, since we weren&#8217;t going to avoid meat on all weekdays.)<br />
No alcohol (because I do it every year), and alcohol and sugar are similar.</p>
<p>Probably will have water only from Thursday of Holy Week until after the Great Vigil.  That is a mind-changing experience, and I try to do it every year.</p>
<p>For context&#8211;the Orthodox fast is vegan except on a couple feast days, and no food with oil on Wednesdays and Saturdays.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I read Hanson&#8217;s latest book and I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about undisclosed motivations.  It&#8217;s a bit depressing, but I&#8217;ve been paying close attention to my and other peoples&#8217; conversations, and a shocking percentage is devoted to showing off; establishing dominance; and/or trying to get laid.</p>
<p>Is it good to be aware of one&#8217;s hidden motivations?  One could argue that we fool ourselves for a reason and an individual is better off believing that he has pretty motivations.  But having thought about it a bit, I am leaning towards thinking that it&#8217;s better to be aware.  If you are subconsciously trying to show off and you become aware of  it, then one can use one&#8217;s conscious mind to think of more effective ways of showing off.  </p>
<p>Not only that, but a lot of the time people don&#8217;t really object if you are somewhat open about your selfish motives.  When I say &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to do the right thing and I&#8217;m also trying to make a few bucks in the process,&#8221; it doesn&#8217;t seem to upset people.  </p>
<p>I wonder what colleges do with applicants who write things like &#8220;And of course a big part of the recent I want to go to Harvard is because I want to have a successful career and it will be a boost both to be able to tell people I went here as well as to make connections with other people with a similar privilege.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think the spaces in which being bluntly open about selfish motives is accepted is smaller than you think, and therefore the college-app gambit you suggest goes poorly. </p>
<p>This is true even in business contexts where you might expect it to be otherwise. Do (non-financial) companies market themselves as &#8220;we&#8217;re driven by making a boatload of money?&#8221; No. They say they&#8217;re &#8220;obsessed with data&#8221; or &#8220;driven to create the best possible [product] or &#8220;customer-centric&#8221; or any number of buzzwords that deliver an impression that money is a pleasant byproduct of the stuff they care about. Everyone knows it&#8217;s sort of bullshit, in the sense that if the data-obsessed engineers weren&#8217;t getting paid they&#8217;d be out in a heartbeat, but the fact that it&#8217;s near-universally adopted, whereas &#8220;we&#8217;re the best because we want to get paid a lot&#8221; is not, should make you question whether your &#8220;and I&#8217;m also trying to make a few bucks&#8221; tagline is serving you well.</p>
<p>The college-app question is like the probably-apocryphal story of the class asked to write an essay on &#8220;What is courage?&#8221; and the student who turns in a one-word response&#8211;&#8220;This.&#8221;&#8211;and gets an A. Cute, but it can only work once (if it ever did), since submitting the same response once you&#8217;ve heard it works is neither brave nor clever. Similarly, the college application letter is a filtering mechanism for selective colleges to, among other things, provide their students with a group of high-quality peers to make social and potential future business connections with. Blunt pragmatism is, as you said of Hanson&#8217;s book, a bit depressing, and not very fun at parties. Moreover, it may be interesting and shocking the first time you hear it, but any halfway-clever 17 year old could tell you that &#8220;Go to Harvard &#8211;&gt; ? &#8211;&gt; Profit&#8221; is a solid plan. If it&#8217;s known to work, it&#8217;s a poor signal, because anyone can do it. An essay tying together your science fair project, your missionary trip to Haiti, and your lifelong love of chess may be a load of BS, but it does require individual, hard-to-fake effort.</p>
<p>All that said, I think some self-awareness about motives can provide value and better guide strategies to accomplish your ends, especially in directing effort towards life projects where surface-level motives and hidden motives don&#8217;t conflict badly. But there are diminishing returns, in that telling yourself &#8220;I&#8217;m not learning to play the piano/improving my tennis serve/gunning for my next promotion because I like these things, but to impress people and get laid&#8221; is going to make the learning process a lot less enjoyable, and probably hinder your eventual results. Many athletes describe being too goal-oriented as a hindrance to peak performance, and being process-oriented as a desirable mindset.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My theory is that if you admit your hidden motivation, it just gets double counted. I.E. companies begin with the assumption that people asking for a job want money, so if they say &#8220;why do you want to work here&#8221; and you say &#8220;because I need a job for money,&#8221; they get the message that money is literally the only thing you care about and that seems kind weird.</p>
<p>Or maybe it&#8217;s not &#8220;double-counting&#8221; and more just that you&#8217;re not supposed to say things that everyone already knows anyway (unless it&#8217;s in a &#8220;the Ultimate Good Thing sure is ultimately good, huh?&#8221; way), so if you do people just think you&#8217;re weird.</p>
<p>Like if a fella approaches a lady to talk to her in a bar or a club or something, she&#8217;s going to begin with the assumption that he wants to engage with her, uh, &#8216;romantically&#8217; so to speak. So if the guy goes up to her and says &#8220;ayy bb u wan sum fuk&#8221; he&#8217;s implying all sorts of things that aren&#8217;t immediately apparent, even if the core message wasn&#8217;t anything anyone didn&#8217;t know already.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Really it&#8217;s all in the delivery.</p>
<p>If I pitched my company to another business as &#8220;we&#8217;re in it to make money, and I&#8217;m personally trying to maximize my salary given my input&#8221;, of course that&#8217;s going to be shit.</p>
<p>But if I say &#8220;we&#8217;re maintaining a proud tradition of more than 4 decades of profitable revenue growth every single year, we pay well for the quality talent we need to continue that growth, and I&#8217;m working to drive value to the company and grow my own career and personal opportunities&#8221;&#8230; well, I think I heard some version of that nearly a hundred times last year.</p>

<p>Yup. Once you read Hanson you never go back.</p>
<p>Me, I&#8217;m glad I did. I like feeling like I understand things, and social-status-colored glasses make a lot of things clearer than they were before. Although in my case I think it helped that I was getting older and starting to notice social patterns more on my own anyway. Might have felt more conflicted when I was younger.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always tended toward socially awkward bluntness and oversharing. If anything, learning to see the status positioning/affirming involved in everyday interactions has improved my social graces. A little. Sometimes.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Given the extraordinarily high salaries good software engineers can command not only in the Valley but all across the US, why is outsourcing and offshoring not used more by startups and the big tech companies?</p>
<p>The explanations I have heard usually refer to the difficulty of working with remote teams across language barriers and different time zones, in addition to having contractors who are incentivized to only perform the minimum work to meet the requirements, get paid and move on to the next project. Which is a reasonable explanation for why outsourcing does not eliminate the high wages of US engineers compared to engineers around the world, but still leaves offshoring unexplained, where Google would open offices in cheaper countries and hire people there. </p>
<p>In fact, all big tech companies have already opened up a lot of offices across the world, and started to let foreign engineers work on their core product (so it&#8217;s not just sales people that they hire).</p>
<p>Even if one could argue that India&#8217;s or China&#8217;s education system is just not up to parenting with the American education system, which just produces more exceptional engineers, surely this can&#8217;t explain why the Big 4 would not hire across Europe and Canada. An engineer at Google London makes AFAIK 60000 dollars a year, which is just one third of his colleague in the Valley. </p>
<p>Given that the major operating cost for tech companies is labor, this seems very counterintuitive to me. Is it American culture that makes better engineers? Or are the big tech companies so successful and rich  at the moment that they don&#8217;t perceive the external pressure needed to change their way of doing business, aka market inefficiency?</p>

<p>Also, there is a certain amount of self-fulfilling prophesy going on. Everyone knows Silicon Valley is the place you find the best engineers, so ambitious companies are keen to locate there and are willing to pay a premium, which pulls in ambitious and capable engineers and enables them to stay, fulfilling the prophesy.</p>
<p>Finally, Silicon Valley is far and away the easiest place to get venture capital funding to start a company, because that&#8217;s where the VCs are located. The VC community is shockingly parochial and prefers to fund companies they can drive to. Hot young companies are therefore disproportionately likely to start in the Bay Area, and mostly stay.</p>

<p>&#8220;The people who have moved to Silicon Valley and bought property are invested in bringing more people to Silicon Valley to continue bidding up property values. If we discover people can do software anywhere in the US, SV land values will plummet.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure I believe that last sentence, but a huge portion of SV paychecks are just going straight into rents and mortgage payments, so I ask who benefits most from this racket?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Argos</p>
<p>Outsourcing and offshoring work great for the hypothetical development cycle: get specs -&gt; built to specs -&gt; get specs -&gt; etc. Unfortunately, reality doesn&#8217;t follow the theory.</p>
<p>The issue is that writing extremely good specifications is pretty much impossible for business oriented people and quite hard and unpleasant for technically oriented people. So the actual specifications that get produced are generally half-baked, missing all kinds of details.</p>
<p>So if programmers merely built what is asked, they tend to have unhappy customers. So instead, they have to figure out all the missing details on their own. This is not that easy and becomes much harder if you don&#8217;t share a cultural context. It is harder if you are not close to the customer. It is harder if you come from a culture where taking initiative is generally punished, rather than rewarded. It is harder if you have to ask questions by mail and regularly have to wait hours/a day because of time zones. Etc.</p>
<p>This is also a major reason why agile development methodologies were developed, BTW. The quick turnaround times and having the customer (representative) near the team makes the real development cycle more effective: guess what the customer wants -&gt; built it -&gt; get feedback -&gt; guess what the customer wants -&gt; etc.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You also have to consider the &#8220;pipeline effects.&#8221;</p>
<p>When you hire an entry-level software engineer, <i>part</i> of what you want is entry-level coding or whatever.  But another part of what you&#8217;re expecting to get is a 1 in 1000 chance you just hired your future CIO or CTO or maybe even CEO.  </p>
<p>If you outsource everything, you have no real leadership pipeline to assume the really important, non-transactional jobs in the future.  When I was in business school, it was common knowledge that most businesses actually lose money on MBA hires for the first 2-3 years.  They treat people like private equity funds treat investments.  You&#8217;re fine with getting no return or even losing money on most of them, so long as you hit a &#8220;home run&#8221; and get 5-20x return every once in a while.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>In addition to all the good reasons you and others have given:</p>
<p>The tech sector continues to be the only reliable growth sector in recent years. That means investors can&#8217;t wait to buy into it, and successful companies make cash hand over fist.</p>
<p>With so much money going into the system, and so much unpredictability in individual results, you&#8217;re going to see results that are:<br />
&#8211; inefficient, because the industry can well afford to be in ways few other can, and<br />
&#8211; more focused most on increasing odds of a runaway success (e.g. &#8220;the next Google&#8221;) than saving money</p>
<p>Runaway success requires multiplicative effects and are incredibly hard to predict. Given that, the investors would rather follow the formula that&#8217;s known to work (&#8220;a small and expensive team that sees its other faces, and is from the culture the product targets&#8221;) than innovate on model to save a bit on underlying cost.</p>
<p>Of course, this is specific to the U.S. tech market. I&#8217;ve seen some evidence that things are different elsewhere, though not enough to speak certainly.</p>

That is, intentionally growing slowly and strongly, keeping money saved up instead of behaving like the stereotypical startup. Like, it seems like you&#8217;re suggesting companies are inefficient just because of insufficient competition, rather than any kind of Moloch-y type stuff, which would presumably leave spare energy for someone to come in and do better if they knew it was an option.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>In an OT in the past, we discussed whether Bill C-16, which adds gender identity and expression to the Canadian Human Rights code, could be used to suppress (supposedly) trans-critical speech or such.</p>
<p>Back then we didn&#8217;t discuss a case that Peterson points at as evidence, which I&#8217;ve recently become aware of, which is the Lindsay Shepherd case (I was aware of the case before, but not of the C-16 link). In her class, teaching assistant and grad student Lindsay Shepherd showed a Jordan Peterson clip that was earlier shown on Canadian public television.</p>
<p>She was subsequently invited to a meeting with 3 people:<br />
&#8211; two professors, one of which was her supervisor<br />
&#8211; an acting manager for &#8216;Gendered Violence Prevention and Support&#8217;</p>
<p>She was admonished in the meeting for showing the clip and partway through the meeting, decided to tape it. The full transcript of what she taped is <a href="https://pastebin.com/2k3jjGKJ" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The relevant part to C-16:</p>
<blockquote><p>Supervising Professor (SP): So the thing is about this, if you&#8217;re presenting something like this, you have to think about the kind of teaching climate that you&#8217;re creating. These arguments are counter to the Canadian Human Rights Code, and I know you talked about C-16. Ever since this passed, it is discriminatory to be targeting someone due to their gender identity or gender expression. So bringing something like that up in class, not critically, and I understand that you&#8217;re trying to-</p>
<p>Shepherd: It was critical. I introduced it critically.</p>
<p>SP: Howso?</p>
<p>Shepherd: Like I said, it was in the spirit of debate.</p>
<p>SP: Okay, &#8220;In the spirit of debate&#8221; is slightly different than &#8220;This is a problematic idea that maybe we want to unpack&#8221;</p>
<p>Shepherd: But that&#8217;s taking sides.</p>
<p>SP: Yes.</p></blockquote>
<p>So the demand was that teachers may only use such clips, if they declare that they are wrong and explain their wrongness, instead of allowing students to come up with arguments in favor and against &amp; then to come to their own conclusions. So this means that they want to disallow Peterson&#8217;s point of view from being advocated for in the classroom, by students.</p>
<p>Furthermore, given the reason that was given, one can assume that this point of view would also not be acceptable outside of the classroom, in places where college authorities have power to decide what is unacceptable. After all, the claim was that the point of view is &#8220;counter to the Canadian Human Rights Code&#8221; and that the viewpoint is &#8220;targeting someone due to their gender identity or gender expression.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I think that we can then conclude that this case was an example where at a college, people in a position of power compared to students/teaching assistants, attempted to stifle free speech using Bill C-16.</p>
<p>However, this of course does not mean that their interpretation will be upheld by the courts, nor that the entire university supports this reading, especially since one of these professors from the meeting (was probably forced to) write a letter of apology. This suggests that the university as a whole does not support this interpretation. However, it does suggest that this interpretation has non-trivial support at this college (after all, 2 professors and an acting manager supported this interpretation). Given Cthulhu, one can see why some people, like Peterson, may worry that more and more people will interpret the law this way, perhaps including judges.</p>
<p>In the US, we see that Title IX, which seems totally benign if one reads the law, has resulted in Title IX panels. These are outside of the judicial system, resulting in people being tried by people without legal training, resulting in trials with absurd rules that often withhold important rights from the accused (and sometimes also from the accuser). When convicted people appeal to the (real) courts, they seem to often get a verdict in their favor, suggesting that some/many colleges over-interpret the law. However, I see no evidence that a correction is happening at universities, to act more in line with the judicial interpretation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if students get a judicial verdict in their favor, this generally merely means that they get monetary compensation, while their education has still been severely disrupted, at an age where such disruption may be very damaging. Students may also not always have the cultural baggage or means to fight back, especially since Title IX cases seem to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/09/the-question-of-race-in-campus-sexual-assault-cases/539361/" rel="nofollow">target minorities</a> very disproportionately. So many people may continue to be harmed, especially when reasonable improvements are resisted due to culture war reasons.</p>
<p>So I would argue that it is equally possible for colleges or other places where certain ideologies are common to wield power against those in a weaker position, based on C-16 type laws, even in the absence of judicial support for an interpretation of Title IX that bans such things as:<br />
&#8211; Not using a pronoun that a person wants to be used<br />
&#8211; Arguing that two genders exist, which have somewhat different biological properties on the group level<br />
&#8211; Arguing that people who don&#8217;t fit in a gender binary are abnormal relative to normal human development<br />
&#8211; Being critical whether certain trans identities are &#8216;real&#8217;<br />
&#8211; Arguing in favor of Blanchard&#8217;s transsexualism typology</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I fail to see the problem. It&#8217;s perfectly fine for universities to take sides, and prohibiting teachers from expressing certain points of view (e.g. that a particular race is inherently superior or inferior) is well within their rights. Freedom of speech does not equate to freedom from the consequences of that speech, such as getting reprimanded or fired, nor does it entail a positive right to a public platform (and certainly not one with official institutional backing like a university podium). As long as people aren&#8217;t getting sued or going to jail for expressing offensive opinions (or otherwise being punished by the government, or by extra-governmental entities using violence or the threat thereof), then the libertarian principle of free speech is not being violated.</p>
<p>Now, you could argue that even if universities could prohibit their employees from expressing certain views, that doesn&#8217;t mean they <i>should</i>. But I would argue that the entire purpose of universities is to teach facts that &#8211; to the best of the modern academic establishment&#8217;s collective knowledge &#8211; are empirically correct, and thus preventing their representatives from spreading misinformation is exactly what they should do. If there was a university that allowed science professors to teach young Earth creationism and hard climate change denialism, then I wouldn&#8217;t consider it to be performing its function well. (And yes, I consider Blanchardism to be just as empirically wrong as creationism and climate change denialism, just like I consider &#8220;trans people&#8217;s gender identities aren&#8217;t valid&#8221; to be as offensive and inaccurate as &#8220;non-whites are physically and mentally inferior to whites.&#8221; If you disagree with me on those points, then at least you can start engaging me about those object-level issues instead of making this about free speech.)</p>
<p>And as for the pronoun issue, people like Peterson make it sound trivial, but the fact is that deliberately misgendering someone on a frequent and consistent basis amounts to harassment. They like to argue that trans people shouldn&#8217;t be so sensitive, but cis people would consider it harassment too, and that&#8217;s obvious if you actually stop to consider the scenario. If someone kept insisting that one of their cis male co-workers was a woman, and exclusively referred to them by female pronouns, that would be seen as extremely rude and unprofessional behavior, and could easily get that person fired if they continued to do it. But since the gender identities of trans people aren&#8217;t seen as valid, the same behavior is somehow considered more acceptable when aimed at them, at least in the eyes of people like Peterson.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Then it&#8217;s a good thing the SSC forums aren&#8217;t your university.</p>
<p>No one is saying that all discussion of this topic should be completely banned. I was saying that universities should not endorse something like Blanchardism as the correct theory or even as a possible correct theory, not just because it&#8217;s offensive, but also because it&#8217;s just plain wrong (at least according to the vast majority of the modern scientific and medical establishment). It&#8217;s the same reason that universities shouldn&#8217;t endorse creationism as correct or possibly correct.</p>
<p>So yes, I would be fine with a professor getting reprimanded or fired if he proposed &#8220;trans women are all just either repressed gay men or autogynephiles&#8221; as a valid theory (or worse, the only valid theory) of transgenderism. Professors should only teach Blanchardism in the context of being an obsolete and discredited worldview, in the same way that they should only teach flat Earth theory in the context of being an obsolete and discredited view.</p>
<p>Now, I don&#8217;t think a student should get in trouble just for bringing it up those ideas in class, since students aren&#8217;t acting as official representatives of the university&#8217;s views and should have more freedom than professors to question the academic establishment. But I would expect a psychology student&#8217;s grade to suffer if he continually insisted that Blanchardism was correct in class discussions and on tests/essays, just like I would expect a geography student&#8217;s grade to suffer if he continually insisted that the Earth was flat.</p>

<blockquote><p>So yes, I would be fine with a professor getting reprimanded or fired if he proposed “trans women are all just either repressed gay men or autogynephiles” as a valid theory (or worse, the only valid theory) of transgenderism. Professors should only teach Blanchardism in the context of being an obsolete and discredited worldview, in the same way that they should only teach flat Earth theory in the context of being an obsolete and discredited view.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is an extremely inaccurate presentation of &#8220;Blanchardism&#8221;. Maybe Blanchard&#8217;s terminology for type 1 (&#8220;homosexual transsexuals&#8221;) may be misleading, but not only don&#8217;t Blanchard &amp; Bailey say that type 1 transwomen are repressed homosexuals, but Bailey is closer to saying that homosexuals are repressed type 1 transwomen. He says in his book (and there are many studies that say the same) that most of the feminine little boys become gays, not trans, as adults, and that some gays were feminine in childhood, but as adults they are embarrassed by remembering that, because femininity is perceived as unattractive by the other gays. </p>
<p>Far from &#8220;Blanchardism&#8221; being &#8220;an obsolete and discredited worldview&#8221;, an important part of Blanchard&#8217;s theory was repeatedly confirmed by research: <b>Blanchard&#8217;s hypothesis about the <i>fraternal birth order effect </i>on gays </b> &#8211; that the more older brothers a man has, the more chances he has to be gay (or type 1 MTF trans):</p>
<p><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-017-1007-4" rel="nofollow">Fraternal Birth Order, Family Size, and Male Homosexuality: Meta-Analysis of Studies Spanning 25 Years</a></p>
<blockquote><p> Meta-analyses were conducted on 30 homosexual and 30 heterosexual groups from 26 studies, totaling 7140 homosexual and 12,837 heterosexual males. [&#8230;] The Older Brothers Odds Ratio was significantly &gt;1.00 in 20 instances, &gt;1.00 although not significantly in nine instances, and nonsignificantly &lt;1.00 in 1 instance. The pooled Older Brothers Odds Ratio for all samples was 1.47, p &lt; .00001. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The third finding was that the FBOE occurs in different cultures and in widely separated geographic regions. The FBOE has been demonstrated in Brazil (VanderLaan et al., 2016), Canada (Blanchard &amp; Bogaert, 1996b), Iran (Khorashad et al., 2017), Italy (Camperio-Ciani, Corna, &amp; Capiluppi, 2004), The Netherlands (Schagen, Delemarre-van de Waal, Blanchard, &amp; Cohen-Kettenis, 2012), Independent Samoa (VanderLaan &amp; Vasey, 2011), Spain (Gómez-Gil et al., 2011), Turkey (Bozkurt, Bozkurt, &amp; Sonmez, 2015), the UK (King et al., 2005), and the U.S. (Schwartz, Kim, Kolundzija, Rieger, &amp; Sanders, 2010).</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/115/2/302" rel="nofollow">Male homosexuality and maternal immune responsivity to the Y-linked protein NLGN4Y</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Plasma from mothers of sons, about half of whom had a gay son, along with additional controls (women with no sons, men) was analyzed for male protein-specific antibodies. Results indicated women had significantly higher anti-NLGN4Y levels than men. In addition, after statistically controlling for number of pregnancies, mothers of gay sons, particularly those with older brothers, had significantly higher anti-NLGN4Y levels than did the control samples of women, including mothers of heterosexual sons. The results suggest an association between a maternal immune response to NLGN4Y and subsequent sexual orientation in male offspring.</p></blockquote>

<p>I know nothing about Blanchardism beyond what I can deduce from the discussion here, but I am curious as to the basis for your confidence. Are you a professional in one of the relevant fields? Have you made an effort to find and argue with intelligent supporters of Blanchard&#8217;s views and found that you are familiar with all of their arguments and what is wrong with them, while they have obviously never seen your arguments or the evidence you offer?</p>
<p>In part, my reaction to the confidence of your statement reflects my experiences long ago in another field. When I was an undergraduate at Harvard another undergraduate commented that he couldn&#8217;t take an economics course at Chicago because he would burst out laughing. That attitude, by a student who had been exposed to one side of an academic controversy, is what your confidence reminded me of.</p>
<p>Within a decade or so, the Chicago view on some of the controversial issues, such as the meaning of the Phillips Curve, had become the orthodoxy. At this point, Chicago has accumulated more Nobel prizes in economics than any other university.</p>
<p>I note that your comment was followed  by a response by someone arguing in some detail that you are mistaken. I await with interest your crushing rebuttal. Since Blanchardism is, according to you, not merely wrong but so clearly wrong that a professor ought to be punished for teaching that it might be right, it should be easy.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@a reader: The part of Blanchard&#8217;s work that I find the most objectionable is his concept of &#8220;autogynephilia&#8221; as an explanation for trans lesbians, and the psychiatric establishment has basically rejected that theory wholesale.* As a trans lesbian myself, I find the idea <i>extremely</i> dehumanizing (and no, reciting the litanies isn&#8217;t going to make me change my mind).</p>
<p>I also strongly dislike the fact that he refers to straight trans women as &#8220;homosexual transsexuals,&#8221; since it&#8217;s implicitly rejecting the idea that they&#8217;re actually women. But I&#8217;m willing to cut him some slack for that, given the time period that he was writing in.</p>
<p>Also, if all gay men are repressed trans women (which is not an interpretation of Blanchardism that I&#8217;ve ever heard before, but I&#8217;ll take your word on it), then why are there so many masculine gay men? Are they all just embarrassed of their femininity? Do they engage in sexual activity with other guys simply because they want to feel like women, rather than out of any genuine attraction? I find that all very unlikely. And what about cis lesbians, straight trans men, and gay trans men? How do they fit into the equation? Is &#8220;autoandrophilia&#8221; a thing too?</p>
<p>More to the point, regardless of which direction the causal chain goes, why does one&#8217;s sexual preferences have to be tied to their internal sense of gender identity in the first place? I&#8217;ve known plenty of cis homosexuals/bisexuals and plenty of trans people of every orientation, and that makes it very hard for me to believe that sexual orientation and gender identity exist on the same axis. If that was the case, wouldn&#8217;t at least some of those combinations not exist?</p>
<p>And yes, Blanchard was completely right about the fraternal birth order effect on cis male homosexuals. He&#8217;s also made a lot of valid contributions to the study of sexual paraphilias. Scientists can be correct or partly correct on some things and still be egregiously wrong on others. When I denounce Blanchardism or &#8220;Blanchard&#8217;s theories,&#8221; I&#8217;m referring to his ideas on trans people, most specifically his transgender typology (which he actually distanced himself from in his later years).</p>
<p>*The DSM-5 does mention autogynephilia, but it&#8217;s considered an isolated sexual paraphilia that&#8217;s unrelated to gender dysphoria.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@albatross11:</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that there is definitive evidence yet and I am not sure how such evidence could be obtained. Maybe by studying the brains &#8211; and also testing the psychological similarities/differences &#8211; of a large sample of both types of MTF transsexuals before starting taking hormones, compared with control groups of (cis) hetero and gay men and women? </p>
<p>There was a study about the brains of MTF trans before starting hormones, but it seems to have a conservative bias: they seemed to want to prove that MTF transgenders are men, so they restricted their sample to &#8220;gynephillic&#8221; MTF trans (that would be type 2 &#8220;autogynephiles&#8221; according to Blanchard&amp;Bailey typology):</p>
<p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/21/11/2525/275208" rel="nofollow">Sex Dimorphism of the Brain in Male-to-Female Transsexuals </a></p>
<blockquote><p>Gender dysphoria is suggested to be a consequence of sex atypical cerebral differentiation. We tested this hypothesis in a magnetic resonance study of voxel-based morphometry and structural volumetry in 48 heterosexual men (HeM) and women (HeW) and 24 gynephillic male to female transsexuals (MtF-TR). Specific interest was paid to gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) fraction, hemispheric asymmetry, and volumes of the hippocampus, thalamus, caudate, and putamen. Like HeM, MtF-TR displayed larger GM volumes than HeW in the cerebellum and lingual gyrus and smaller GM and WM volumes in the precentral gyrus. Both male groups had smaller hippocampal volumes than HeW. As in HeM, but not HeW, the right cerebral hemisphere and thalamus volume was in MtF-TR lager than the left. <b>None of these measures differed between HeM and MtF-TR. MtF-TR displayed also singular features and differed from both control groups by having reduced thalamus and putamen volumes and elevated GM volumes in the right insular and inferior frontal cortex and an area covering the right angular gyrus.</b>The present data do not support the notion that brains of MtF-TR are feminized. The observed changes in MtF-TR bring attention to the networks inferred in processing of body perception.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course <i>&#8220;The present data do not support the notion that brains of MtF-TR are feminized.&#8221;</i> if they exclude by design the ones whose brains are probably feminized &#8211; and the sample is small (24 trans) but anyway, this is the only study I know about the brains of the supposed type 2 &#8220;autogynephiles&#8221; without mixing them with type 1.</p>
<p>For the psychological traits, maybe some evidence can be found by analyzing Scott&#8217;s survey (the one from 2016 had an unexpectedly big sample of transsexuals).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I get the impression that Peterson is not objecting to using a transgender person&#8217;s normal masculine or feminine pronouns, especially if they personally ask you to (i.e. referring to a female-presenting person as she/her and a male-presenting person as he/him) but to having it punishable by the government not to use whatever neologism a particular person wants used (ze, zer and things of that ilk).</p>
<p>And this particular case, as far as I can tell, was not about Shepherd being censured for expressing her point of view (in the sense of siding with Peterson in the debate clip she played &#8211; she says she didn&#8217;t) but rather for failing to take sides against him. Not sure if that makes a difference to your argument, but if Peterson&#8217;s argument was that Bill C16 would have a serious chilling effect on freedom of expression (afraid I&#8217;ve not actually watched the clip in question yet, and am not on a machine with sound right now), then I wouldn&#8217;t have thought that that could be reasonably compared to espousing creationism in a biology class.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s also made the argument elsewhere that he considers the law to be likely to do more harm than good to the gender-fluid / non-binary people it purports to protect, by making potential employers extremely wary of hiring them, if they could be held criminally liable if any of their employees inadvertently fail to use the correct neologism for the person in question. Again, you can argue that he&#8217;s overblowing things, but I don&#8217;t think you can reasonably claim that he is <i>obviously,</i> young-Earth creationist level wrong.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>To clarify, I didn&#8217;t think Peterson&#8217;s views on this law were akin to creationism. I think the object-level idea that trans identities aren&#8217;t valid (i.e. that trans women are just delusional cis men and trans men are just delusional cis women) is akin to creationism. Over the past two decades, there&#8217;s been an enormous amount of hard scientific evidence confirming that trans people have noticeably different neural structures and hormone levels than cis people, to the point where gender dysphoria could basically be considered an intersex condition.</p>

<p>I think <a rel="nofollow"href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/">Scott&#8217;s response to this argument</a> is definitive:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Imagine if we could give depressed people a much higher quality of life merely by giving them cheap natural hormones. I don’t think there’s a psychiatrist in the world who wouldn’t celebrate that as one of the biggest mental health advances in a generation. Imagine if we could ameliorate schizophrenia with one safe simple surgery, just snip snip you’re not schizophrenic anymore. Pretty sure that would win all of the Nobel prizes. Imagine that we could make a serious dent in bipolar disorder just by calling people different pronouns. I’m pretty sure the entire mental health field would join together in bludgeoning anybody who refused to do that. We would bludgeon them over the head with big books about the side effects of lithium.</p>
<p>Really, are you sure you want your opposition to accepting transgender people to be “I think it’s a mental disorder”?</p></blockquote>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>But the surgery/hormone route is pretty radical, compared to other potential discoveries, is it not?</p>
<p>What if we could just give someone a pill that would cause them to &#8220;forget&#8221; they were trans and immediately be happy and content identifying with their biological sex?</p>
<p>How do you think people would react to such a discovery?  Could anyone even get money to start research on such a thing?</p>

<p>Scott&#8217;s response is definitive only if you already agreed with it.  I, and I&#8217;ll bet everybody on my side, agrees that you shouldn&#8217;t misgender people.  The issue our sides disagree on is which direction the &#8220;misgendering&#8221; arrow points.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to use female pronouns for somebody born male.  (Or vice versa)  The farthest I&#8217;m willing to go is to compromise by avoiding the use of pronouns entirely.  Having a doctor chop off your hoink and give you a counterfeit vagina doesn&#8217;t change the fundamental facts.  I&#8217;m willing to feel bad for people so afflicted; I&#8217;m not willing to be browbeaten into dishonesty.  &#8220;Let the lie come into the world, let it even triumph. But not through me.&#8221;</p>

<p>That may, for all I know, be true. But it doesn&#8217;t follow that someone who is biologically male and has gender dysphoria is really female, hence that anyone who thinks that person is male with dysphoria is objectively wrong, which seems to be what your argument requires.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@DavidFriedman: Even by a strict biological definition, sex is not purely defined by chromosomes or visible genitalia, it&#8217;s a classification that encompasses a lot of different traits (e.g. internal genitalia, secondary and tertiary sex characteristics, hormone levels, neural structures).</p>
<p>If gender dysphoria is indeed caused by endocrinological and neurological factors (and there&#8217;s an overwhelming amount of evidence showing that it is), then someone who was assigned male at birth but feels gender dysphoria isn&#8217;t biologically male <i>or</i> biologically female, they&#8217;re biologically intersex. If someone has a Y chromosome and a penis, but they also have developed breasts and high estrogen levels and low testosterone levels and neural structures that resemble those of cis women more than cis men, then I wouldn&#8217;t consider them male by a strict definition of the term, and the medical community would agree that they should be classified as intersex.</p>
<p>It is, in fact, objectively wrong from a biological perspective to say that trans women are exactly the same as cis women. My point is that it&#8217;s <i>also</i> objectively wrong from a biological perspective to say that trans women are exactly the same as cis men.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@LadyJane: My working hypothesis is that some &#8220;transwomen&#8221; have intersex brains and other body parts, and some don&#8217;t. I think some biological males in areas of leftist hegemony are performing a role to get better treatment (&#8220;I&#8217;m not a cishet dude, I&#8217;m a lesbian! Look how I wear my hair (while making no other effort to pass!)&#8221;<br />
I think there&#8217;s a very low rate of background gender dysphoria, 0.2% tops, and a society can increase gender-bending among females by being rigidly patriarchal or among males by being absurdly Blue.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Le Maistre Chat: Sure, but who cares? Some people pretend to be disabled to get government benefits, but it would be ridiculous to use that as evidence that no one is really disabled, or to subject all disabled people to rigorous scrutiny in all social situations because they might be faking it. And I&#8217;m sure there are a lot less people pretending to be trans than pretending to be disabled, since there are a lot fewer concrete benefits to being trans.</p>

<blockquote><p>Would this change your feelings?</p></blockquote>
<p>Still being deceived.  I mean, obviously I wouldn&#8217;t know that I&#8217;m being deceived, by the terms of your hypothetical.  However, even a deception that you can get away with is wrong.</p>
<p>@Brad</p>
<blockquote><p>I think we are all familiar with the very selective compulsion to never speak an untruth. Funny how that tic works.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which statements of mine are you thinking of?  I&#8217;ll be happy to clarify.  I try to be consistent, but humans can be inconsistent, and I&#8217;m human, so therefore I&#8217;ve done it in some of my posts.  Post a link and we can talk.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Here’s a picture of my new baby. Isn’t she beautiful?”<br />
“No, actually she looks like an alien.”</p></blockquote>
<p>1) A small social white lie to get through a one-off conversation is a little different than an ongoing demand.  I generally try to be honest but noncommittal (see 2), but if I can&#8217;t avoid it I&#8217;ll bite my tongue a couple times.  However, if they keep waylaying me with pictures of the kid and demanding to know if she&#8217;s beautiful, the truth is eventually going to come out.  As tactfully as I can, but there&#8217;s a fuckin&#8217; limit.</p>
<p>2) Tapdancing to technically tell the truth is my preferred solution.  I&#8217;ve been lucky to not be presented with a baby or pictures thereof that isn&#8217;t cute, so I&#8217;ve not been faced with this exact situation. However, &#8220;Wow, she is something!&#8221; are words to consider&#8211;the parents can take them as they will.  I&#8217;m not a superstar in tact, so if suddenly confronted with this situation I might not get a technically-true but noncommittal statement mentally put together before reaching for the social lie, but putting in the effort is often worthwhile.</p>
<p>3) Most everybody would agree that the white lie is, well, a lie.  If I were to turn to a compatriot after the parents leave and say, &#8220;Whoa.  That kid is going to have a rough time of it,&#8221; I would expect agreement.  Here, however, the debate is about what the truth <i>is</i>.  I mean, unless you&#8217;re willing to acknowledge that we&#8217;re all just lying by calling a woman &#8220;he&#8221; to make transsexuals feel better.  I&#8217;d be willing to talk, if you&#8217;re saying that&#8217;s the case, since I would consider it an improvement over the status quo.</p>
<blockquote><p>Surely you aren’t willing to be browbeaten into dishonesty, right? Something, something the gulag! Four lights!</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I went back and forth on including the Solzhenitsyn quote.  I&#8217;ve never actually been confronted with this issue in real life, so I can&#8217;t claim there&#8217;s some kind of oppression I&#8217;m personally fighting here.  I went with it because it&#8217;s the most concise statement of the necessity to be honest, even in the face of a dishonest world.  It also ties in with the Lutheran conception of adiaphora in the Formula of Concord, and the necessity to stand firm in what would otherwise be unimportant details when you&#8217;re being forced to make a change.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s better to fight it before it <i>becomes</i> oppression, and it feels like we&#8217;re heading in that direction.  The demand that we acknowledge that men are really women and vice versa is absolutely bonkers on the order of &#8220;four lights&#8221;, though nobody is threatening the things I care about to try to make me acknowledge it.  Yet.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The fraction of AMAB people I know that wound up having what Tumblr used to call &#8220;genderfeels&#8221;, leading to social transition in most but not all cases, is as best I can figure somewhere north of 2% &#8212; so one or two orders of magnitude higher than the old estimates for intersex conditions or GID.  Now, I don&#8217;t think any of them were or are consciously faking it for attention or to gain special treatment, but I also have a hard time believing that they&#8217;d all have lived the rest of their lives in gender misery if they&#8217;d been born twenty or thirty years earlier.  That seems like the kind of thing that would&#8217;ve been noticed, by Freud et al. if no one else &#8212; 2% is about the prevalence of most personality disorders.</p>
<p>Also, it just occurred to me that most, maybe <i>all </i>the transwomen I know not only live in extremely Blue environments, but also grew up in Red ones or in non-Western countries.  We aren&#8217;t talking &#8220;moved to somewhere that&#8217;ll accept their real self&#8221; either, though &#8212; in every case I&#8217;d known them for years as men before they transitioned.  Granted, it&#8217;s not exactly <i>rare</i> to move like that, but it&#8217;s uncommon enough that this probably isn&#8217;t a coincidence.  Not sure what to make of it though.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>It is, in fact, objectively wrong from a biological perspective to say that trans women are exactly the same as cis women. My point is that it’s also objectively wrong from a biological perspective to say that trans women are exactly the same as cis men.</p></blockquote>
<p>The question isn&#8217;t whether they are exactly the same–no two people are. It is whether, given a grammatical structure with only three options&#8211;male, female, neuter&#8211;which makes a better imperfect fit for the trans woman.</p>
<p>The answer is not obvious. So far as my intuition goes, it can be either male or female depending on which the person comes across as&#8211;which is a statement about external appearance and behavior, not what someone thinks of him/her self as. </p>
<p>Other people might draw the line in other ways. But your position seems, if I correctly understand what you have been posting, to be that everyone has an obligation to draw the line in the way you prefer, to classify someone who self-identifies as female as female, someone who self-identifies as male as male. </p>
<p>Is that a misreading of your position?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@LadyJane</p>
<p>Many people see two distinct groups of transwomen, those who generally transition early and those who generally transition late. Many in the latter group seem to describe their trans feelings as having increased over time, which is peculiar and which suggests a possible cultural cause (or a combination of nature &amp; nurture).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen several trans people argue that the &#8216;I always felt that I was my new gender&#8217; is a false narrative that they use for expediency, because people cannot understand their true feelings.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard quite a few people argue that they have autogynephilia.</p>
<p>We also see that a fairly large percentage of kids <a href="http://www.psypost.org/2017/12/many-transgender-kids-grow-stay-trans-50499" rel="nofollow">stop feeling transgender later in life</a>. So apparently, these feelings can both increase and decrease over time.</p>
<p>In very blue tribe environments, there also seem to be subcultures where gender non-conformance is seen as being trans. I wonder if these people are not just being confused by a broken subculture that assumes an overly strong link between traits and sex, so they think that having traits that are less common for one sex, means that one is<br />
(partially) of the other sex.</p>
<p>I think that some blue tribe environments are highly misandrist, so it makes sense that some people would try to escape that oppression by claiming to be trans. I would seriously think about doing so if I were forced to live in such an environment. When being &#8216;oppressed&#8217; is seen as legitimizing bad behavior towards the &#8216;oppressors,&#8217; it is crucial to stay out of the latter group.</p>
<p>Finally, lots of the research and other information around this subject seems tainted by advocacy, where people reason towards conclusions that they think will help them/transgender people.</p>
<p>So this leaves me wary of drawing strong conclusions right now, including dismissing or accepting Blanchard&#8217;s transsexualism typology, believing or not believing that transitioning is helpful for everyone who at one point in their life has dysphoria, believing that there is a single cause or not, believing that there are a substantial portion of people who claim to be trans who are honestly or dishonestly faking it, etc, etc.</p>
<p>When the evidence is so weak, I also believe that professors/teachers should be allowed to have and espouse their own beliefs, preferably while noting that the evidence for their beliefs is highly imperfect and that there are other beliefs.</p>
<p>Ultimately, universities are not just about teaching, but they are about generating knowledge. This requires that professors can have heterodox views.</p>

<blockquote><p>3) Most everybody would agree that the white lie is, well, a lie. If I were to turn to a compatriot after the parents leave and say, “Whoa. That kid is going to have a rough time of it,” I would expect agreement. Here, however, the debate is about what the truth is. I mean, unless you’re willing to acknowledge that we’re all just lying by calling a woman “he” to make transsexuals feel better. I’d be willing to talk, if you’re saying that’s the case, since I would consider it an improvement over the status quo.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t say lie because I don&#8217;t think the group of people for which the pronoun &#8216;she&#8217; should be used is the kind of question for which there is a fact of the matter in the first place. Your side of this debate seems to implicitly transform each usage of &#8216;she&#8217; into some kind of creedal statement.</p>
<p>But to the general point, yes, I would expect you to say &#8216;she&#8217; under the same reasoning that you would say &#8216;what a pretty baby&#8217; and for much the same reason. LadyJane may not be happy with me for saying so, but that&#8217;s my position.</p>

<p>News to me. When I read that argument, I ignored it as a non-sequitur of some sort. Now I think it&#8217;s a strawman, but it&#8217;s not Scott&#8217;s fault, obviously. </p>

<p>I don&#8217;t oppose accepting transgender people any more than I oppose accepting schizophrenics or people who believe they are Napoleon. I think their plight &#8211; dysphoria &#8211; is real, and unfortunate. </p>
<p>What I oppose is:<br />
&#8211; Regarding the condition as perfectly normal, or deserving of normalization, as opposed to a delusional state like other mental disorders.<br />
&#8211; Attempting to solve the issue via means that cannot possibly work with the current medical technology, most notably SRS.<br />
&#8211; Propagandizing and privileging the condition so much that people who are not afflicted pretend to be to gain bennies.</p>

<p>If it&#8217;s a question that you think can&#8217;t be answered one way or the other, then why do you care which I use?  If you happen to think that it&#8217;s a trifling matter about which we can&#8217;t really know the truth anyway, then why the issue with me using the ones that I feel strongly about?</p>
<blockquote><p>Your side of this debate seems to implicitly transform each usage of ‘she’ into some kind of creedal statement.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just as your side of the aisle transforms the use of &#8220;he&#8221; in that situation into a creedal statement.</p>
<blockquote><p>But to the general point, yes, I would expect you to say ‘she’ under the same reasoning that you would say ‘what a pretty baby’ and for much the same reason. LadyJane may not be happy with me for saying so, but that’s my position.</p></blockquote>
<p>You&#8217;re trying to use the language of politeness as a lever to enforce your policy prescriptions.  FWIW, I think you&#8217;re sincere, but incorrect.  If I don&#8217;t agree with your policy prescriptions, saying &#8220;Oh, just suck it up.  You don&#8217;t want to be <i>rude</i>, do you?&#8221; is a hell of an imposition.</p>
<p>That aside, I actually do not agree that politeness demands that I use the pronoun &#8220;she&#8221; for a MtF transsexual (or vice versa).  I think the maximum that I&#8217;m obligated to do is to <i>not</i> use the pronoun &#8220;he&#8221;, which is a real stretch, but one I&#8217;d be willing to make.</p>
<p>As I said, I&#8217;ve not been faced with this situation IRL, but if it came up my objective would be to avoid having anybody notice I&#8217;m not using pronouns for the individual in question.  Given that the Pronoun Police would be out in force at that point (the only place I could see this coming up is work, since I&#8217;d probably drop a personal relationship or group that required it), I doubt I could keep it unnoticed for very long, but I&#8217;m damn sure going to make somebody look for it.  I&#8217;m certainly not going to announce it, and evade to the maximum extent possible if asked about it.  However, what I will not do is actually use &#8220;she&#8221;.</p>

<p>OK, then where exactly does sex/gender reside?  A person with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome may always have appeared outwardly female, despite the XY genotype?  Are they (perhaps accidentally) deceiving people about their gender?  A person with Swyer syndrome  (also XY) will appear female as a child, but fail to develop secondary sexual characteristics without hormone therapy&#8230; are they deceptive if they take the therapy?</p>
<p>Is it just that they once were anatomically male?</p>

<p>That is the solution I try to use in real life for a situation where my perception of a person&#8217;s gender and that person&#8217;s self identification are different.</p>
<p>I think putting it as my perception is more accurate than putting it as &#8220;what the person&#8217;s gender is.&#8221; The one MTF post surgery transsexual I know comes across to me as a woman, if a somewhat odd looking one, so I would be more uncomfortable using &#8220;he&#8221; than &#8220;she.&#8221; The one person who I know self-identifies as female while having an apparently male body and behavior I think of as male, so try to avoid using gendered pronouns when referring to.</p>
<p>If I knew that someone was genetically one gender but morphologically the other, as I gather very occasionally happens, I&#8217;m pretty sure I would go with the morphology.</p>
<p>The reason using the &#8220;wrong&#8221; pronoun feels to me like lying is that my speech expresses my thoughts, so if I don&#8217;t think of someone as female it is dishonest to use feminine pronouns for him.</p>

<p>Words are just tools that we use to communicate. Some languages use separate words to refer to light blue and dark blue; others, like English, use only one and modify it. Is the sky the same colour as my blue jeans? What is the truth of the matter?</p>
<p>Pluto is no longer a planet; plenty of people argued against the change, but as far as I&#8217;m aware nobody did so on the basis that denying the planethood of Pluto would be a lie, and that would violate their moral convictions.</p>
<p>Words are just Schelling points. If you refuse to acknowledge Mrs. Rockefeller as Nelson&#8217;s wife, you aren&#8217;t falling back to some immortal truth about what the word &#8220;wife&#8221; really means. You are making a political claim about how you think society should be organized, and what the institution of marriage should look like, in an attempt to shift the Schelling point. Similarly, if you refuse to use somebody&#8217;s preferred pronouns, that&#8217;s not a heroic commitment to the truth. It&#8217;s an assertion about what the word &#8220;she&#8221; <i>should</i> mean. It&#8217;s a claim that society is better when we think about gender in terms of birth sex than when we think about gender in terms of a person&#8217;s self-conception.</p>
<p>Now, maybe that claim is right, and maybe not. We each have our own opinions. But it&#8217;s not the sort of claim where either side can just say &#8220;We are defending the truth, and you are asking us to lie&#8221;. The entire debate is about where we should draw the boundaries of a category. When you claim that your preferred boundary is the truth, you aren&#8217;t making an argument; you&#8217;re just stating a conclusion.</p>

<p>You have it exactly correct.  I very much do believe that &#8220;that society is better when we think about gender in terms of birth sex than when we think about gender in terms of a person’s self-conception.&#8221;  The reason I originally commented (and I normally scroll by all arguments of this type here because they&#8217;re uninteresting&#8211;this one is boring, too, but I&#8217;m trying to avoid throwing a grenade and then leaving) was because of your claim that Scott&#8217;s article was &#8220;definitive&#8221;, where it really requires a bunch of left-wing assumptions.</p>

<p>For myself it&#8217;s a non-issue. I&#8217;m not trans and I don&#8217;t have any friends or family that are trans. But some people really care quite a bit. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think they especially care whether or not you &#8220;really&#8221; believe that they are a woman. I think using the desired pronouns is good enough. More like Judaism than Christianity in that sense. That&#8217;s frankly where I am&#8211;more orthoprax than orthodox.<br />
(N.B. I have low confidence in this understanding, it could be that most trans people really do care.)</p>
<blockquote><p>You’re trying to use the language of politeness as a lever to enforce your policy prescriptions. FWIW, I think you’re sincere, but incorrect. If I don’t agree with your policy prescriptions, saying “Oh, just suck it up. You don’t want to be rude, do you?” is a hell of an imposition.</p></blockquote>
<p>What policy prescription exactly? I usually think of that as something having to do with governance.</p>
<p>Anyway, I do think it is a matter of rudeness. I acknowledge that &#8220;it&#8217;s rude&#8221; isn&#8217;t the be and end all of the discusison. I chimed in here to makes the points that a) I don&#8217;t think &#8216;lie&#8217; really captures what&#8217;s going on and in any event b) most people lie all the time for reasons of politeness. Maybe not you, but most people. If there is something unusually objectionable here I don&#8217;t think it suffices to just say &#8220;you are forcing to choose between being polite or lying&#8221;. </p>
<blockquote><p>That aside, I actually do not agree that politeness demands that I use the pronoun “she” for a MtF transsexual (or vice versa). I think the maximum that I’m obligated to do is to not use the pronoun “he”, which is a real stretch, but one I’d be willing to make.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given sufficient charisma and grace to pull it off, this seems like a very good compromise. The ideal from a politeness perspective is that no one walks away with hurt feelings.</p>

<p>I feel like you are missing an important element:</p>
<p>Nobody is demanding that other people stop using preferred pronouns for transgender people.  (Well, nobody here I have seen, and I have zero interest in trying to steelman that position anyways)</p>
<p>There is literally only one side behaving as if their preferred definition is Truth here.  Only one side is demanding the other capitulate and use words the Right way.</p>
<p>Can you guess which side it is?</p>
<p>Also, I am tapping out as translator after this.  Somebody else can try to convert heat to light. This whole debate is kind of dumb, and I am getting just a little annoyed that I am spending it defending a position I think is kind of dumb because the opposition can&#8217;t put forward an actual argument.</p>
<p>So, the actual argument, stepping outside my neutral zone:</p>
<p>You change word definitions all the time, your language constant adapts and changes.  Your objection is not to the change in language, which you accept without thought in 99% of cases, but the sense that the change in language is being forced on you.  But the assholes pushing the change aren&#8217;t the people who actually want it &#8211; they are pushing the change exactly because they know you will resist it, so they can paint you as antisocial, anti-trans neanderthals.</p>
<p>This is not the goddamned hill to die on.  There is no useful principle here.  This is a wasteland battlefield of their choosing, not yours, over a situation that doesn&#8217;t actually matter to you except that the enemy has chosen to fight you on it.  Because ten years ago we weren&#8217;t having this freaking debate, because almost nobody actually cares, except as some bullshit to hate the other side for.</p>

<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s just too much science fiction at a young age, but when I see trans people, I mainly see people being screwed over because our medical technology sucks.  They want the Donna-&gt;Donno transition from _A Civil Campaign_, but they get the hack job we can do with modern medical technology.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Matt M: If there was a pill that relieved all feelings of gender dysphoria, then I&#8217;d imagine that some people with gender dysphoria would be extremely grateful, and many others would reject it. Personally, I view a person&#8217;s fundamental identity/sense-of-self as being a product of their mind (i.e. brain/nervous system) more than their body (i.e. outwardly visible sex characteristics), so I would consider altering their mind to actually be <i>more</i> radical and invasive than altering their body. Either way, it wouldn&#8217;t fundamentally make a trans woman suddenly become a cis man, no more than transitioning via hormone therapy and sexual reassignment surgery will fundamentally change a trans woman into a cis woman.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re looking at the narrative as if it&#8217;s &#8220;[Biological Male] who wants to be [Biological Female] uses drugs and surgery to become [Biological Male Resembling A Biological Female],&#8221; and your alternative is &#8220;[Biological Male] uses a cure to stop wanting to be [Biological Female].&#8221; In actuality, it&#8217;s more like &#8220;[Biological Intersex Person Who Resembles A Biological Male But Feels Closer To Being A Biological Female] uses drugs and surgery to become [Biological Intersex Person Who Resembles And Feels Closer To Being A Biological Female]&#8221;, and your alternative is &#8220;[Biological Intersex Person Who Resembles A Biological Male But Feels Closer To Being A Biological Female] uses a &#8216;cure&#8217; to become [Biological Intersex Person Who Resembles And Feels Closer To Being A Biological Male].&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@LadyJane</p>
<p>It is absolutely normal to alter the mind. In fact, most of the West forces children to go to mind altering institutions (schools).</p>
<p>You seem to believe that it is crucial to preserve people&#8217;s mental traits, but this very belief may be a broken mental pattern.</p>
<p>Suppose that we have a person who is so pessimistic that he doesn&#8217;t participate in life beyond the bare necessities and that this person is resentful of the more optimistic. He doesn&#8217;t want to be like those privileged people who take their abilities for granted, etc, etc. Basic ego-protection by resenting those with a better life. </p>
<p>Now suppose that we give him a pill to remove that extreme pessimism. Now the person can have a job, partner, social life, etc. Do you think that this person will now resent himself or do you think he will alter his views because the resentment was merely a crutch? I think the latter.</p>
<p>People are great at rationalizing. Why should we avoid helping people who are in agony to preserve their mind, when the way that their mind works is part of their agony? Doesn&#8217;t the same logic prohibit helping anyone? &#8216;That missing leg is part of who you are and how you relate to the world, so no prosthesis for you.&#8217;</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t this just cruel?</p>

<p>If pre-pill-person states that he&#8217;d prefer not to become post-pill-person, then post-pill-person&#8217;s experiences are not going to be very relevant in the debate.</p>
<p><i>Suppose that we have a person with normal human emotions. He repeatedly states that he does not wish to engage in the usual behaviors that a robot only experiencing pure bliss would engage in.</p>
<p>Now suppose that we replace the person with a robot only experiencing pure bliss. Do you think that robot will now experience resentment or do you think that it will experience pure bliss? I think the latter.</i></p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Anonymous: Regarding your first point, you&#8217;re right insofar as we can&#8217;t ever be 100% certain that someone claiming to have gender dysphoria actually has it. Some might be lying, for whatever reason. Others might genuinely believe they have it when there&#8217;s actually a different reason for their feelings. Nonetheless, I would much rather assume good faith, since there&#8217;s no real harm in a false positive, but a lot of harm in denying an honest person&#8217;s claims about their psychological state and sense of identity. (Obviously if I was a certified gender therapist, I&#8217;d apply more rigorous standards to my patients, but I&#8217;m talking about day-to-day personal interactions here.)</p>
<p>@Aapje: It&#8217;s a difficult question, and I don&#8217;t proclaim to make any judgments on the &#8220;correct&#8221; answer, if such a thing even exists. All I can say is that I personally would much rather change my anatomical structure than my mental state, given a choice between the two.</p>
<p>Your first example doesn&#8217;t quite match the situation, because the dichotomy there is &#8220;alter your mind or keep suffering,&#8221; whereas the trichotomy here is &#8220;alter your body, alter your mind, or keep suffering.&#8221; And even then, the choice still isn&#8217;t as black and white as you make it out to be, as publiusvarinius demonstrated.</p>
<p>As for your example about the person with a missing limb, I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s more of an argument for physical transitioning than against it. Having gender dysphoria is like having phantom limb syndrome, and hormone treatments and/or sexual reassignment surgery are like the prosthetic limb used to treat it. If you were missing a limb, what would you prefer: a pill that would cure all feelings of phantom limb syndrome, or a replacement for the actual limb?</p>

<p>Yes, there _is_.  Demanding I refer to e.g. a bald guy with a beard as &#8220;she&#8221; is _messing with my head_.  If it can be harmful to a trans- person to be referred to by pronouns they feel don&#8217;t match their identity, why can it not be similarly harmful for a cis person to be required to refer to others by pronouns the cis person feels are inappropriate?</p>

<p>Personally, of the three trans people I have known, two were quite earnest, and the third wanted to both be referred to using female pronouns while also sporting a magnificent beard.</p>
<p>So&#8230; I can say that it happens.  Couldn&#8217;t guess at the frequency.</p>
<p>I waver on the optics of the situation.  On the one hand, normalization. On the other, obnoxious special snowflakes might just make people angry.</p>
<p>Granted it is out of my control even if I cared overmuch, but I do wonder whether people who do care should be forwarding the idea, pushing back on it, or continuing to ignore it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3043071/" rel="nofollow">30 year follow-up study</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Persons with transsexualism, after sex reassignment, have considerably higher risks for mortality, suicidal behaviour, and psychiatric morbidity than the general population. Our findings suggest that sex reassignment, although alleviating gender dysphoria, may not suffice as treatment for transsexualism, and should inspire improved psychiatric and somatic care after sex reassignment for this patient group.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also:</p>
<blockquote><p>It should therefore come as no surprise that studies have found high rates of depression,[9] and low quality of life[16], [25] also after sex reassignment. </p></blockquote>
<p>Now, my argument is not that we should ban or remove funding for hormone therapy and/or sexual reassignment surgery, but rather that it is dangerous to idealize it, just because being in favor is seen as the way to support trans people, because criticizing it is seen as handing the political outgroup ammunition, etc.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the fairly rapid increase in trans diagnoses may consist in (large) part of people with different characteristics than those who were diagnosed and/or treated in the past. So we should be open to the possibility that the same treatment is less effective for them, for example because more people seek help with less severe dysphoria or because people see transitioning as the best way to gain respect and/or support from their (hateful) subculture.</p>

<p>Comparing to the general population is not particularly meaningful. It&#8217;s not hard to see why trans people might still have problems, even post-SRS &#8212; particularly since this data is from 1973-2003. </p>
<p>If you saw a study saying &#8220;Depressed people using SSRIs have considerably higher risks for mortality, suicidality, and psychiatric morbidity than the general population&#8221;, would you take that as an argument against SSRIs?</p>

<p>I explicitly said that my objection was not to having the treatment, but to those who idealize it. Perhaps you read my comment too quickly, not grasping what I argued?</p>
<p>In my opinion, your criticism* of the study merely supports my argument that we should be willing to recognize that the treatment can work differently for different year groups.</p>
<p>* And I also think that it is too dismissive, because a 30 year study is not nothing.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Aapje: I&#8217;d agree that the findings of a 30 year study are significant. In this case, they proved that trans people (or in this case, the subset of trans people who&#8217;ve medically transitioned) have higher rates of depression and lower overall life satisfaction than the general population, which I don&#8217;t think should be surprising to anyone.</p>
<p>My point (and Iain&#8217;s point) is not that the study is insignificant, but that it doesn&#8217;t offer any proof that it&#8217;s the hormone treatments or surgery that cause depression and lower life satisfaction, which seem more likely to result from simply being trans in the first place. In order to prove that, there would have to be a sample group of trans people who haven&#8217;t medically transitioned. So I don&#8217;t see how this is evidence against HRT/SRS, or even really evidence that we shouldn&#8217;t &#8220;idealize&#8221; it, whatever that means. (Unless you&#8217;re just saying &#8220;we shouldn&#8217;t let trans people think HRT/SRS will automatically solve all of their gender-related issues instantly,&#8221; in which case you&#8217;re correct but also stating the obvious.)</p>
<p>On the object level, I find it very likely that trans people who undergo HRT/SRS tend to be less depressed and have higher life satisfaction than trans people who don&#8217;t. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it was by a huge margin. (Whether they&#8217;d be more or less depressed than trans people who took a hypothetical dysphoria cure is debatable, since no such cure exists and real-life conversion therapies tend to be both barbaric and ineffective.)</p>

<p>At worst, you&#8217;re being forced to confront the fact that one of the categorical lenses through which you view the world is only ~98.5% accurate and not 100% accurate, and sometimes there are exceptions that don&#8217;t fit neatly into one of your pre-existing boxes. Sorry if that makes you feel uncomfortable, but in the grand scheme of things, I really can&#8217;t bring myself to care that much.</p>
<p>It also says a lot that you had to resort to such an extreme example to justify your feelings of discomfort. Most trans women do not look like bald men with beards.</p>

<p>OK, then the &#8216;harm&#8217; caused by the fact that someone used what you consider the wrong pronouns in referring to you is laughably trivial.  I dismiss those psychological and social consequences <i>thus</i> (waves hand).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@The Nybbler: You&#8217;re a group now? Because there are plenty of cis people who have absolutely no problem using trans people&#8217;s preferred pronouns. If the group in question is &#8220;transphobes and stubborn confused people who feel uncomfortable about things they don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; then yes, I&#8217;m fine arbitrarily dismissing their concerns.</p>
<p>Considering the amount of discrimination and dehumanization that trans people face on a regular basis, it&#8217;s really hard for me to take &#8220;it makes me feel uncomfortable&#8221; seriously as an argument. Does it honestly make you feel uncomfortable to the same degree that being actively harassed on a frequent basis would make you feel uncomfortable?</p>
<p>Hell, even without comparing it to vastly more severe wrongs, it still seems very trivial in its own right. It&#8217;s exactly the sort of &#8220;my feelings are more important than scientific facts/social norms!&#8221; attitude that conservatives love to make fun of social justice warriors for.</p>

<p>This is just bad tactics, LadyJane.</p>
<p>You know what helps? &#8220;Look, I understand that when you look at me, your first and entirely non-malicious inclination is to refer to me with this pronoun set, and believe me, no one wants to remedy that confusion more than I. I understand that doing this might be confusing, that is a significant ask for some people, and in fact, too much for some.  So, because this is legitimately and deeply important to me, I&#8217;m asking you to work with me on this, with the understanding that you doing this is effort, and I&#8217;ll accept slip-ups and confusion that arises in good faith.&#8221;</p>
<p>The point where you say &#8220;I&#8217;m fine dismissing the concerns of people who have issues using preferred pronouns.&#8221; is the point where quite a lot of people with those issues shrug, nod, and become equally fine dismissing your concerns, and the concerns of a lot of trans people, in turn.  And no matter where you think the weight of moral suasion lies, that&#8217;s a really, really bad tactic when you are a tiny minority, because if you get coordinated action with two teams, one being trans people and the other people being people with a notable discomfort with using preferred pronouns which contradict someone&#8217;s apparent or historic gender presentation, the second group is going to be a hell of a lot larger.</p>

<p>OK then.  If the answer to you feeling uncomfortable is that I must change my terminology to make you feel comfortable, but the answer to me feeling uncomfortable is to say I&#8217;m a transphobe whose feelings don&#8217;t matter&#8230; then we&#8217;re just down to a pure power struggle, as with no reciprocity it seems unlikely there&#8217;s any true moral component.  And while there is thankfully only one of me, I would bet there&#8217;s a lot more people who don&#8217;t want to be bullied about their pronouns than there are trans people.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hell, even without comparing it to vastly more severe wrongs, it still seems very trivial in its own right.</p></blockquote>
<p>The point is I&#8217;m not comparing it to vastly more severe wrongs.  I&#8217;m comparing it to a rather similar sort of wrong.  One is creating a sort of mental dissonance in you, the other is creating a sort of mental dissonance in me.</p>

<p>Probably, but this isn&#8217;t the right comparison.</p>
<p>I would bet that it&#8217;s pretty close to there being a lot more people who want to bully you about pronouns than there are people who don&#8217;t want to be bullied about it.  And the balance tilts farther in their favor every day.</p>
<p>That group includes the host of this blog.  Which is low stakes enough.  But I <i>definitely</i> wouldn&#8217;t recommend intentionally &#8220;misgendering&#8221; someone at school or at the workplace.  That&#8217;s more likely to end very poorly for you than it is for them&#8230;</p>

<i>You know what helps? “Look, I understand that when you look at me, your first and entirely non-malicious inclination is to refer to me with this pronoun set, and believe me, no one wants to remedy that confusion more than I. I understand that doing this might be confusing, that is a significant ask for some people, and in fact, too much for some. So, because this is legitimately and deeply important to me, I’m asking you to work with me on this, with the understanding that you doing this is effort, and I’ll accept slip-ups and confusion that arises in good faith.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>You mean like this?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;I know that it’s not uncommon for people to misgender a trans person they just met, and I understand that slip-ups can happen from time to time, especially if the trans person in question isn’t particularly passable.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;If someone misgendered me or another trans person I knew, I would politely correct them. After that, if they made an effort to use the correct pronouns (or neutral pronouns, or no pronouns), but still slipped up from time to time, I would ignore the periodic slip-ups. If it became too frequent, I would correct them again, still politely but a little more firmly.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said more or less exactly what you recommended at two separate points in this very thread. The reason I was so flippant with The Nybbler is because I&#8217;ve spent a good deal of time writing detailed arguments for why trans identities are valid and should be respected, and his response basically amounted to &#8220;but it&#8217;s weird and I don&#8217;t wanna!&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>If the group in question is “transphobes and stubborn confused people who feel uncomfortable about things they don’t understand,”</p></blockquote>
<p>On the evidence so far, I&#8217;m not the one here who feels uncomfortable about things I don&#8217;t understand&#8211;unless your definition of &#8220;understand&#8221; is &#8220;Agree with Lady Jane about.&#8221;</p>
<p>I discussed the fact that the binary model of gender is only an approximation, in print, and some of the issues it raises, nine years ago, partly inspired by a student paper in a course I taught some years earlier (<i>Future Imperfect</i>, <a href="http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Future_Imperfect/Chapter14.html" rel="nofollow">Chapter XIV</a>). I know at least two people who are in one sense or another transsexual, and get along with both of them. </p>
<p>What I am uncomfortable with is the idea  that I am obligated to either believe something or pretend to believe something on someone else&#8217;s orders. The claim that a true statement of my beliefs will make someone uncomfortable does not strike me as close to justifying that. </p>
<p>As far as I know I have never met you, so I don&#8217;t know whether, if I did, I would see you as male or female. But whichever it is, I am not prepared to pretend differently in order to make you feel more comfortable.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@The Nybbler: No, I don&#8217;t see it as being purely a power struggle between competing preferences, because I firmly believe that a trans person&#8217;s discomfort at being misgendered is both more severe and more valid than someone else&#8217;s discomfort at using their preferred pronouns. More severe, because I know trans people who&#8217;ve questioned their own identities and self-worth over being misgendered, sometimes to the point of being depressed or even suicidal. More valid, because they have an actual reason to feel upset (they&#8217;re being told that they&#8217;re something they aren&#8217;t, and nothing they do can convince people otherwise), whereas you haven&#8217;t explained why using their preferred pronouns would upset you, and I&#8217;m rather doubtful that you have any real reason beyond an instinctive knee-jerk reaction.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Honestly, the real question here is <i>why</i> so many people feel &#8220;uncomfortable&#8221; with the idea of using a trans person&#8217;s preferred pronouns, and more broadly, with the idea of accepting trans identities as valid.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been going back and forth in this thread for a while now, and from what I can tell, there are four main reasons people might reject the validity of trans identities:<br />
1.) They&#8217;re highly devoted to a religion and/or a culture in which trans identities aren&#8217;t considered valid. I feel some sympathy for these people, just like I feel some sympathy for creationists. At the same time, I don&#8217;t think their personal religious/cultural beliefs should take precedence over social norms in secular settings (as I said in response to Friedman&#8217;s example below, I&#8217;d consider it incredibly rude if a Catholic refused to call a remarried woman by her new surname).<br />
2.) They believe that the gay/trans agenda is part of some postmodernist left-wing feminist Cultural Marxist conspiracy, and they think they&#8217;re defending free speech and fighting (or at least spiting) the SJW establishment by being aggressively contrarian about issues like preferred pronouns. These people are misinformed at best and completely delusional at worst, and I find them to be morally repulsive, to the point where I refuse to engage or associate with them at all.<br />
3.) They earnestly believe that &#8220;transgender identities aren&#8217;t real&#8221; (i.e. that there are no meaningful biological differences between a trans woman and a cis man (or between a trans man and a cis woman), that gender dysphoria is caused purely by societal factors and has no biological basis, and that the best treatment for gender dysphoria is to get people to stop wanting to change their apparent sex rather than entertaining their delusions), and they refuse to deny what they see as Truth by &#8220;pretending&#8221; that people are things they aren&#8217;t. These people are the reason I&#8217;m posting about this topic. They&#8217;re rational and genuinely well-intentioned and they tend to be fairly open-minded, and I&#8217;m hoping my arguments will change the minds of at least a few of them. For what it&#8217;s worth, I used to be in this category myself.<br />
4.) They have no real reason that they can articulate or explain in any meaningful way, beyond the fact that it clashes with their intuitions and makes them uncomfortable in some ineffable fashion.</p>
<p>There also seems to be another group that believes only *some* trans people&#8217;s gender identities are valid, while other trans people are either delusional or simply pretending to be trans for the sake of some perceived benefits. (For what it&#8217;s worth, I live in an ultra-liberal enclave city, and even in social circles comprised mostly of socially progressive 20-somethings, trans people are still very much treated as barely-tolerated token minorities, or as outcasts altogether. The idea that there&#8217;s any social benefit to being trans &#8211; outside of a few extremely small and insular queer groups &#8211; is laughable.) There&#8217;s probably some low percentage of people claiming to be trans who are just confused or lying, but I doubt they comprise more than a small fraction of the already small trans population. At any rate, I don&#8217;t know why so many random cis people think they&#8217;re qualified to judge whether or not someone&#8217;s really trans at a glance, considering it can take professional gender therapists weeks or months to figure it out. In the spirit of good faith, I would much rather err on the side of caution and take people at their word.</p>

<blockquote><p>They have no real reason that they can articulate or explain in any meaningful way, beyond the fact that it clashes with their intuitions and makes them uncomfortable in some ineffable fashion.</p></blockquote>
<p>People have argued that having to use a pronoun that mismatches with their pattern matching causes mental dissonance and/or high mental load.</p>
<p>From what I&#8217;ve heard, it is common for people who have known a trans person before the transition, to have built up a mental model based on the pre-transition gender. It can then be extremely hard to alter that mental model, especially since gender is so fundamental to how most people categorize &amp; make sense of people and their behavior. So it&#8217;s not a mostly unconnected fact at the edge of the mental model, that can be fairly trivially altered, like to update the model when someone gets a new haircut, but one that has a neural connection to many parts of the mental model. Updating the model so extensively is hard and updating it fully or partially may be impossible for many/most. This can cause accidental misgendering. Many people fear being attacked over this as if they intended to do harm, when their behavior is unintentionally offensive. Such a fear can mean that a person is permanently stressed while near the trans person and scientific research suggests that being stressed for long periods is extremely harmful.</p>
<p>A separate possible cause of mental dissonance and/or high mental load is that most people have pattern matchers used to categorize people into male and female. This is important because of gender roles. Treating a man as a woman or vice versa by default is generally a socially unsuccessful strategy. So people who encounter a non-perfectly transitioned person will then logically have conflicting perceptual information, causing mental dissonance. This can mean that they will then escalate to a higher cognitive system, which causes a high mental load. However, their more base cognitive systems may also decide on their own, especially if the person is already under high mental load, causing misgendering without any ill intent or even intent at all (since the base cognitive systems made the decision, below the level what we generally call &#8216;intent&#8217;). Again, people may fear being attacked over this and may experience high stress while near the trans person.</p>
<p>To be blunt: SJ people have not been particularly empathetic with male nerds in the past, mostly demonizing the common mental traits of this group and the consequences thereof. Or to put it in SJ parlance: they have been extremely ableist. In general, SJ people seem very prone to stomp all over the rights and needs of those whose issues they have trouble recognizing &amp; worse, the ideology is full of rationalizations why cries of pain from certain groups should be ignored (or even taken as evidence that the stomping is helping to create a better world). So my standard assumption is that SJ people will generally not try to find a balance between the needs and limitations of various groups, but that they will implement extremist policies that causes immense harm to their outgroup whenever possible, even if their rhetoric is merely about helping the ingroup. This is the logical consequence of severely under-appreciating the needs of the outgroup, made worse by an ideology that tends to see resistance by the outgroup as a desire for oppression, rather than fighting for their own needs.</p>

<p>You say you see four types of people.</p>
<p>But your &#8220;four types of people&#8221; looks more like the category you had before you entered into this discussion than anything that arose from it &#8211; who here has argued on religious grounds against trans identities?  Conrad is the only person I am certain is religious who has spoken up here, and his basic attitude is pretty clearly &#8220;Make an effort at passing and I&#8217;ll make an equal effort at trying to recognize you as the gender you want to be&#8221;.</p>
<p>You have quite the closed mind there.  Since you don&#8217;t seem to realize this, let me impress something upon you: You are asking people for something.  Shitting on them when they negotiate for anything other than exactly what you want isn&#8217;t how you convince people you are working in good faith at arriving at a world which is better for everybody.</p>
<p>Doubly so when you say their complaints are illegitimate and don&#8217;t matter.  If you have a good argument why their complaints are less legitimate, make it.  Don&#8217;t just assert it like they are subhuman garbage for having complaints.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m on your side.  I&#8217;m fucking on your side.  Quit making me regret being there.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Also, on number 4, I have given you an explanation.</p>
<p>You just don&#8217;t understand the explanation.</p>
<p>So, let me drive this a little deeper:</p>
<p>When most of us grew up, &#8220;Gender is evil&#8221; was the dominant social narrative.  Believing &#8220;he&#8221; and &#8220;she&#8221; referred to anything other than sexual characteristics was regarded as SEXISM.  There were two freaking decades dedicated to the idea that &#8220;man&#8221; and &#8220;woman&#8221; is just a way of describing physical characteristics, and insisting on any deeper meaning is sexist.  This was drilled into two generations of people&#8217;s brains.</p>
<p>So when somebody who has zero interest in presenting as a woman comes along and insists on being referred to as &#8220;she&#8221;, it makes us really fucking uncomfortable, because what the fuck is this insistence supposed to convey?  What are you saying about yourself?  What are you saying about the role you want to play in society?</p>
<p>Clearly you are saying there is something to &#8220;she&#8221; other than what your physical sex characteristics are.  It sounds like that sexism thing we spent the 90s shutting down.  It sounds like you are saying there is something to that kind of sexism, that it is something meaningful.  It sounds like you are saying something about women.  And the fact that you keep insisting on the word &#8220;gender&#8221; rather than &#8220;sex&#8221; really, really doesn&#8217;t help.</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t give a shit, because it pattern matches to &#8220;punks playing polka&#8221;, which is to say, people doing uncool things because they are uncool because fuck society.  But I do understand why the other people do, and you aren&#8217;t trying to understand why they are getting upset, you are just insulting them for it.</p>
<p>They have a legitimate reason to be upset.  You just don&#8217;t understand that reason because you apparently didn&#8217;t grow up in a society in which &#8220;she&#8221; meant you weren&#8217;t supposed to play with Legos, and you literally seem incapable of understanding what all this pattern-matches to.  You are welcome, by the way.</p>

Eh. There are certainly parts of trans culture and advocacy that are in significant tension with second wave feminism, but I don&#8217;t think pronoun choice is especially one of them.</p>
<p>In some alternate universe where at the same time mailman was becoming mailperson and chairman was becoming chair, gender neutral pronouns could have started taking over. If that had been the case, and we were 30 years downstream from it, then sure insisting on gendered pronouns for and only for trans people would be retrograde and cause dissonance. But we aren&#8217;t in that universe. If a staunch second wave feminist is okay with using he/she on the basis of largely meaningless dangling bits than he should be okay with also using them on request. And singular they, along with the entire concept of gender non-binary, should be enthusiastically embraced as the unfinished work of the 70s.</p>
<p>To sum up, I agree there&#8217;s a horseshoe between &#8220;I love to shop because I have a woman&#8217;s brain&#8221; and &#8220;Woman are natural nurtures and don&#8217;t belong in competitive fields&#8221; but I don&#8217;t think pronoun debates invoke much of those problematic aspects.</p>

<p>This is only unusefully true.  Politeness requires saying things you don&#8217;t necessarily believe, and <i>that everyone knows you don&#8217;t necessarily believe and that have no real consequences</i>.  Politeness may well include addressing the guy with the sign on his bike &#8220;King of Germany&#8221; who&#8217;s shadow-boxing with a telephone pole as &#8220;Your Majesty&#8221;; it doesn&#8217;t include addressing Charles Stuart as &#8220;Your Majesty&#8221;, or inviting the crazy guy to the reception for the German ambassador.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure the whole TURF thing is pretty explicitly second-wave.</p>
<p>(Autocorrect keeps trying to turn that into second-rate.  I am half tempted to leave it.)</p>
<p>At any rate, my point isn&#8217;t that the pronouns fit neatly into that horseshoe.  The new definitions are built on self-identity.  The problem comes in because the identity that somebody is identifying with &#8211; the category they are asking to be placed in &#8211; isn&#8217;t the same category for other people it is for them.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>1.) They’re highly devoted to a religion and/or a culture in which trans identities aren’t considered valid. I feel some sympathy for these people, just like I feel some sympathy for creationists. At the same time, I don’t think their personal religious/cultural beliefs should take precedence over social norms in secular settings (as I said in response to Friedman’s example below, I’d consider it incredibly rude if a Catholic refused to call a remarried woman by her new surname).</p></blockquote>
<p>The Catholic position on transgendered individuals is that they&#8217;re individuals who need empathy and compassion. Some may have a mental problem where they believe they&#8217;re a sex they&#8217;re not, others may have a physical problem where their genitals don&#8217;t match their mind. Either way, we are called to empathy and compassion for the sick.</p>
<p>The divorce thing is a bit trickier. No one would gleefully refuse to acknowledge a remarriage, and would probably do so with some internal turmoil. I&#8217;m going through this right now. Two of my married Catholic friends are going through a divorce, and she&#8217;s dating a new guy. She is <i>wonderful</i> 10,000% wife material. I&#8217;ve never met such a wonderful person and homemaker. And her ex-husband is the biggest fool on the planet. No idea what the hell he&#8217;s doing. Perfect wife, two adorable children, and he&#8217;s all &#8220;naw I&#8217;mma go bang younger chicks.&#8221;  It&#8217;s very awkward. I hung out with the woman and her new boyfriend this past weekend and I was super friendly but yeah I kept thinking &#8220;JESUS DOESN&#8217;T LIKE THIS WHY DID EVERYTHING GO WRONG HERE THIS WASN&#8217;T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.&#8221;</p>

<p>There can be implications for accepting gender binaries if you also accept trans identities as valid. Mostly if you&#8217;ve come from the angle LadyJane has about how their are clear biological differences in the brain separating trans from cis people and that these are a sign that trans people&#8217;s identities are <i>scientifically correct</i>. Less so if you come from an angle like &#8220;do whatever you feel best, gender is make-believe anyways&#8221;.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>The baseline assumption is that pretty much everyone is required to be polite, and that politeness involves saying things you don’t necessarily believe.</p></blockquote>
<p>Generally, in social situations or cultures which have elaborate politeness rules, there are <i>also</i> elaborate rules to make sure you don&#8217;t put somebody in a place where it is hard for them to be polite. If I say &#8220;your baby is ugly&#8221; I&#8217;m the asshole. If you keep pestering me to tell you if I think the baby is cute why haven&#8217;t you said anything yet isn&#8217;t the baby cute I notice you haven&#8217;t commented on its cuteness, you&#8217;re the asshole. Making up new pronouns or changing the definitions of existing ones and insisting everybody who doesn&#8217;t obey your new rules is rude seems much more like the latter to me. It&#8217;s not saying we won&#8217;t play the game. It&#8217;s saying you&#8217;re not the referee, and you don&#8217;t get to change the game on the fly.</p>
<p>Anyway, arguing over who is being most impolite reminds of arguments over who has the burden of proof. It&#8217;s just an attempt to sidestep the real argument and win by rules-lawyering.</p>

<p>So do you not follow any social norms, or do you just not perceive the other 99% as forced on you?</p>
<p>@Jaskologist</p>
<p>The equivalent of forcing someone to be rude would be inventing new pronouns but not saying what they are. Which is not happening in our reality (although it is in Royston Vasey).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>or do you just not perceive the other 99% as forced on you?</p></blockquote>
<p>Speaking for myself, probably this.</p>
<p>If I call your baby ugly, you may consider me rude and be less likely to be my friend&#8230; but you <i>won&#8217;t</i> haul me in front of some sort of human rights tribunal with the power to fine me and/or send me to jail.  You <i>won&#8217;t</i> organize massive protests trying to get me fired from my job, etc.</p>
<p>The reaction to &#8220;misgendering&#8221; is completely and entirely different in scale than to virtually all other examples of simply being impolite.  If the only reaction to it was that people who were more blue-tribe minded whispered to each other that you were kind of a jerk &#8211; I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re having this argument in the public square.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>The divorce thing is a bit trickier. No one would gleefully refuse to acknowledge a remarriage, and would probably do so with some internal turmoil. I’m going through this right now. Two of my married Catholic friends are going through a divorce, and she’s dating a new guy. She is wonderful 10,000% wife material. I’ve never met such a wonderful person and homemaker. And her ex-husband is the biggest fool on the planet. No idea what the hell he’s doing. Perfect wife, two adorable children, and he’s all “naw I’mma go bang younger chicks.” It’s very awkward. I hung out with the woman and her new boyfriend this past weekend and I was super friendly but yeah I kept thinking “JESUS DOESN’T LIKE THIS WHY DID EVERYTHING GO WRONG HERE THIS WASN’T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, this is an interesting case*. One thing I probably should have brought up in my original response to the Rockefeller case David brought up, and which I think Anonymous may have been gesturing towards, is that maybe our norms about what it is and isn&#8217;t polite to say aren&#8217;t the best, and so as a friend maybe you <i>should</i> be able to counsel them on their marriage and faith, and the seriousness of what the husband is doing here, and the wife too by now dating another man. Of course, this is pretty far afield of the Rockefeller case, and I&#8217;m a lot less sure the norms in the Rockefeller case need to change.</p>
<p>*I don&#8217;t mean to downplay their suffering by speaking clinically here, so sorry if I come across that way.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Jaskologist,</p>
<blockquote><p>Making up new pronouns or changing the definitions of existing ones and insisting everybody who doesn’t obey your new rules is rude seems much more like the latter to me. It’s not saying we won’t play the game. It’s saying you’re not the referee, and you don’t get to change the game on the fly.</p></blockquote>
<p>A number of people have made the argument that not calling someone by their preferred pronoun is, if not dehumanizing, at least extremely distressing to some trans folks. My trouble here is, what do we do about cases like that? It&#8217;s not like we can cleverly avoid the use of pronouns all the time, not the way we might skirt around other differences, so it seems inevitable that by sticking to your guns here you&#8217;re sometimes going to cause someone extreme distress.</p>
<p>I <i>want</i> to say the solution is just for people to develop a thicker skin à la Haidt or Peterson, but 1) I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s practical, and 2) I&#8217;m not sure how that generalizes, and 3) I guarantee that proposal in this case has terrible, terrible optics.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ve been avoiding this because I don&#8217;t mind using people&#8217;s preferred pronouns as long as they don&#8217;t get offended if I mess up accidentally, but I have to register some agreement with one of Thegnskald&#8217;s points. Gender essentialism makes me uncomfortable, and a lot of trans people seem to have pretty strongly gender essentialist views. Not all of them, of course; Ozy clearly doesn&#8217;t, to take a well-known example. And, yes, gender essentialist views bother me when they come from people who aren&#8217;t trans as well; I read Maggie McNiell&#8217;s blog because I support the sex worker cause and she&#8217;s a good source to keep updated on news related to that, but she&#8217;s pretty strongly gender essentialist and it always bothers me a little bit when that comes out in her discussions too.</p>
<p>Anyway, as a result the rhetoric of &#8220;everyone has a real self that is gendered&#8221; which LadyJane is pushing makes me a little uncomfortable, and I am not happy at feeling like I&#8217;m pandering to gender essentialism in going along with it. I go along with it anyway, because I don&#8217;t think gender is a big deal and I do have a strong streak of live and let live and people can be what they like, but I still always dislike the rhetoric when it comes up.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>I don’t know how you *argue* about affect</p></blockquote>
<p>For instance, you say &#8220;The n-word is associated with centuries of oppression of African-Americans, and for that reason using it clearly communicates disregard.&#8221; Or you say, &#8220;Calling a woman the archaic name for a dog is dehumanizing because it is literally a reference to a non-human, therefore it is emotional abuse in most context.&#8221;<br />
In this case, the argument is &#8220;Using the pronoun of the human gender a person appears to be or has been in the past is dehumanizing because &#8230; &#8221;<br />
Fill in the blank with something reasonable or you look like a utility monster. </p>
<p>It looks like the argument is &#8220;because determining one&#8217;s own identity is a fundamental human right&#8221; but this is not currently the case for most contexts.<br />
You cannot unilaterally declare yourself Japanese, a doctor, a member of a random family, or any number of things.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Randy M: I think you hit the nail on the head by mentioning utility monsters.  It seems like society is facing a threat where people who have, or pretend to have for personal advantage, a certain brain or hormone disorder get to say &#8220;call me by the pronouns I want or it&#8217;ll hurt my feelings so bad it violates my human rights and I&#8217;ll call down the power of the state to have you dragged before a human rights tribunal!&#8221;<br />
My goodness, I certainly hope for the sake of overall human utility that 1.7% of the population hasn&#8217;t always and everywhere been this fragile, suffering incalculable stress because the police werent swooping in to protect their feelings&#8230;<br />
It makes me embarrassed to have ever had gender dysphoria. I <b>never</b> want to be one of Nietzsche&#8217;s Last Men.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p> More valid, because they have an actual reason to feel upset (they’re being told that they’re something they aren’t, and nothing they do can convince people otherwise)</p></blockquote>
<p>Happens to me all the time. People have been claiming I am a utilitarian for thirty years or so, despite the fact that the relevant index entry in my first book is &#8220;Utilitarian, why I am not.&#8221; I see lots of other misrepresentations of what I am, ideologically speaking. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I have any right to have people only believe true things about me, although it would be nice. Their beliefs are in their heads, which belong to them. Certainly I have a right to feel upset, although mostly I don&#8217;t, but &#8220;it&#8217;s wrong for you to do anything that upsets me&#8221; strikes me as an unreasonable moral rule.</p>
<p>I just put up a <a href="http://daviddfriedman.blogspot.com/2018/02/slandering-past.html" rel="nofollow">post</a> on my own blog discussing, among other things, a historical claim made by the Rabbi who officiated at my son&#8217;s wedding that I believe is clearly wrong. She is unlikely to read the post, but I have also made the point, in slightly weaker form, in email correspondence with her. She seems to be someone willing to be argued with, so it&#8217;s possible that being told that she was publicly saying obviously false things about the subject she is supposed to be expert in won&#8217;t upset her&#8211;but if it would, am I obliged to refrain from pointing out the error?</p>

<blockquote><p>I’ve been going back and forth in this thread for a while now, and from what I can tell, there are four main reasons people might reject the validity of trans identities:</p></blockquote>
<p>As best I can tell, none of those four describes my reasons for declining to use pronouns for people that don&#8217;t fit my perception of what those people are. That supports the point I made earlier, that I&#8217;m not the one failing to understand the views on the other side.</p>
<p>Could you be clearer about what &#8220;accept the validity of trans identities&#8221; means? As I think I made clear in the passage in <i>Future Imperfect</i> that you read, my guess is that at least some people who see themselves as having female minds in male bodies (or the reverse) are correct. I don&#8217;t know which. </p>
<p>Does &#8220;accept the validity&#8221; mean &#8220;believe that anyone who claims to be female really is female&#8221;? Does it mean &#8220;pretend to believe that &#8230;&#8221;? Does it mean &#8220;revise my concepts of male and female so that &#8216;male&#8217; means &#8216;claims to be male&#8217; and &#8216;female&#8217; means &#8216;claims to be female'&#8221;?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@The Ancient Geek:</p>
<blockquote><p>So do you not follow any social norms, or do you just not perceive the other 99% as forced on you?</p></blockquote>
<p>I can&#8217;t think of any social norms I obey that require me to pretend to believe things I don&#8217;t believe. The closest I can come to it was, a few days ago, reciting a blessing at my son&#8217;s (Jewish) wedding which clearly implied the existence of God. Doing that bothered me a little, but it was obvious that I was reciting an existing text&#8211;the Rabbi first recited the text in Hebrew and I then gave the English translation&#8211;so I thought it was closer to an actor speaking lines than someone saying what his own views were, so was willing to do it.</p>
<p>Confronted with a baby&#8211;I like babies&#8211;I am likely to say something positive, but I wouldn&#8217;t describe a baby as beautiful if I thought it was ugly. In the sort of social situation where you are expected to say something false I generally find evasions that don&#8217;t require me to do so.</p>
<p>Can you offer an example of a situation where I would be following a social norm that required me to say something false? </p>
<p>On another point you make &#8230;  . Someone who uses a racial slur is doing it in order to offend, which is under most circumstances something you shouldn&#8217;t do. Someone who perceives an mtf transsexual as female but uses &#8220;he&#8221; in order to offend is similarly acting badly. A more plausible example would be someone who calls a man &#8220;she&#8221; in order to imply feminine behavior, as an insult.</p>
<p>That has nothing to do with someone who refers to an mtf transsexual as &#8220;he&#8221; because he perceives that person as male.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>One point that I don&#8217;t think has been raised in this discussion but should be &#8230;</p>
<p>A is talking to B about C, not present. C is a transsexual who self-identifies as female but appears, at least to A, to be male. A refers to C as &#8220;he.&#8221; A is, in Lady Jane&#8217;s language, &#8220;misgendering&#8221; C. Is there something wrong with doing so? What?</p>

<blockquote><p>It seems like society is facing a threat where people who have, or pretend to have for personal advantage, a certain brain or hormone disorder get to say “call me by the pronouns I want or it’ll hurt my feelings so bad it violates my human rights and I’ll call down the power of the state to have you dragged before a human rights tribunal!<br />
My goodness, I certainly hope for the sake of overall human utility that 1.7% of the population hasn’t always and everywhere been this fragile, suffering incalculable stress because the police werent swooping in to protect their feelings…<br />
It makes me embarrassed to have ever had gender dysphoria. I never want to be one of Nietzsche’s Last Men.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nice strawman. Yes, I believe that if someone accidentally misgenders someone, they should be arrested by heavily armed men and dragged to the Hague and sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes against humanity, without trial. Is that what you&#8217;d like me to say?</p>
<p>All I&#8217;ve argued is that 1.) intentionally misgendering someone is extremely rude and should be considered a violation of social norms, on par with using racial epithets, and 2.) constant misgendering directed at a specific person amounts to harassment, and is valid grounds for expelling or firing someone, just like constantly directing racial epithets at a fellow student or co-worker would be.</p>
<p>You all keep acting as if trans people are demanding special treatment, when in fact we&#8217;re just asking to be treated with the same respect as everyone else. If you&#8217;re walking down the street and say &#8220;hey, miss!&#8221; to the person in front of you, but they turn around and it turns out they&#8217;re actually a cis man (and very visibly so), you&#8217;re probably not going to get upset or feel like you&#8217;re being oppressed if they correct you, and you&#8217;re probably not going to stubbornly keep referring to them as a woman. And if you did continue to call them &#8220;miss&#8221; for whatever reason, then I don&#8217;t think most people would blame them for getting upset with you. Why should it be any different for trans people?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@LadyJane: To the best of my knowledge, it&#8217;s not a strawman, it&#8217;s how state power works in Canada. If you want to argue that Canada is a weakman of the LGBT rights position, with the American LGBT defenders who outnumber them 10-1 disapproving, that&#8217;s fine.<br />
Because that&#8217;s what&#8217;s at stake in my mind: that &#8220;transgender&#8221; means &#8220;utility monster&#8221; and they want state power to be their nanny protecting them from the incalculable disutility of hurt feelings. This is nothing against the brain or hormonal problem, which is entirely sympathetic, and all about choosing to serve the Left in a dialectic that will lead to the Last Men, unreasoning utility monsters who think all of human history was nothing but oppression until their mores invented happiness.

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Le Maistre Chat, I did a double take too, since Aapje&#8217;s original post was about C16 and the Shepherd case, and LadyJane&#8217;s first comment was &#8220;I don&#8217;t see the problem,&#8221; but, looking back, she&#8217;s never actually defended the use of state power. Rather, her focus has been on the right of universities (and organizations more broadly, I take it) to regulate such things among its employees; that the professors said Shepherd was violating C16 doesn&#8217;t appear to factor into her argument.</p>

<blockquote><p>Does “accept the validity” mean “believe that anyone who claims to be female really is female”? Does it mean “pretend to believe that …”? Does it mean “revise my concepts of male and female so that ‘male’ means ‘claims to be male’ and ‘female’ means ‘claims to be female&#8217;”?</p></blockquote>
<p>If you want to get really technical, I suppose it would mean 1.) revise your concepts of male and female to acknowledge the fact that people with male &#8216;minds&#8217; (i.e. neuro-hormonal systems) and female &#8216;bodies&#8217; (i.e. outwardly visible sex characteristics) exist, and vice-versa, 2.) accept people with male minds as being male, and people with female minds as being female, even if their bodies don&#8217;t match, and 3.) believe that someone who claims to have a male/female mind is both correct and honest.</p>
<p>Honestly, an argument could be made that all trans people are really just intersex, and thus aren&#8217;t truly male or truly female. If you referred to all trans people with gender-neutral pronouns on that basis, or refused to describe them with any gendered pronouns at all, I would be fine with that and wouldn&#8217;t consider it misgendering. Other trans people might disagree, though.</p>
<blockquote><p>On another point you make … . Someone who uses a racial slur is doing it in order to offend, which is under most circumstances something you shouldn’t do. Someone who perceives an mtf transsexual as female but uses “he” in order to offend is similarly acting badly. A more plausible example would be someone who calls a man “she” in order to imply feminine behavior, as an insult.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you continually insist on misgendering a trans woman &#8211; even if you&#8217;re just using the term that seems most intuitive to you, and your intent isn&#8217;t to offend them &#8211; you&#8217;re still effectively making an object-level claim that they are not a woman (which is debatable, depending on how exactly you define &#8220;woman,&#8221; but I would strongly disagree), and furthermore that they actually just a delusional cis man (which is objectively false). Does that adequately explain why they would take offense to it?</p>
<blockquote><p>A is talking to B about C, not present. C is a transsexual who self-identifies as female but appears, at least to A, to be male. A refers to C as “he.” A is, in Lady Jane’s language, “misgendering” C. Is there something wrong with doing so? What?</p></blockquote>
<p>The claim that C is male is wrong on the object level.</p>
<p>In terms of social etiquette, I don&#8217;t think A is necessarily being rude; manners, unlike morality, only apply when people who care about them are around. But I also don&#8217;t think it would be rude for B to correct them, or get upset with them if they continued doing it, or tell C that A really thinks of her as a dude.</p>
<p>If A was talking to B in a professional context (for instance, if the three of them were all co-workers), then I don&#8217;t think it would be appropriate at all, and I wouldn&#8217;t blame B for reporting A to their boss.</p>

<p> Is the standard for employability going to be set by the average transexual advocate, or the most disagreeable?</p>
<p>But more importantly, here you very nearly reach a point of agreement with the opposition with which I would align.<br />
Other than this concession above, you are wanting &#8220;female&#8221; to be defined entirely by the mental experience, ostensibly verifiable by brain scans (but the trans individual is not required to present any evidence beyond the subjective, right?). Not &#8220;socially classed as female&#8221; but &#8220;actual female&#8221;. As in, no essential difference between transsexual person claiming female and median representative of the category. </p>
<p>I can accept with compassion that there are individuals exhibiting a regrettable mismatch between brain and body. I will agree decency requests we treat these people kindly. I will entertain the notion that they are distressed by word choices and attempt to minimize this.</p>
<p>The broader ideological claim, though, that the category of woman should contain both the woman-brain man-body and the woman-brain woman-body, and there is no reason for a linguistic distinction beyond bigotry or ignorance&#8211;this claim is attempting to alter reality through naked force of will and is bound to failure and smacks of forcing people to admit to a falsehood in order to show your power over them.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all well trod ground around here by now. I thought Scott&#8217;s Tumblr post from a year or so back outlined the disagreement clearly, but little chance I could find the post I&#8217;m remembering.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Le Maistre Chat: Even the Canadian law doesn&#8217;t make it illegal to misgender someone. It doesn&#8217;t even regulate what universities can teach like Aapje was claiming. The university in question decided to set a standard, as it has every right to do; it wasn&#8217;t legally obliged to do so.</p>
<p>The C16 law prohibits discrimination against people on the basis of gender identity and gender expression (i.e. refusing to serve or rent to trans people, expelling or firing someone for coming out as trans), and it expands hate crime laws to cover instances where the victims were targeted for their gender presentation. The idea that someone&#8217;s going to get arrested for accidentally misgendering a trans person is ridiculous, it&#8217;s just another paranoid conservative fantasy.</p>
<p>In principle, I don&#8217;t disagree with your stance. In practice, I think your particular concerns are very far removed from the actual reality of the world, and worse, they make you apathetic if not outright hostile towards the very real struggles facing trans people today. You&#8217;re tilting at windmills and running through peasants in the process.</p>
<p>While I do worry a lot about the ever-increasing power of the state and the rising trend toward authoritarianism, I <i>really</i> don&#8217;t think the main threat to liberty is going to come from trans people or gay rights activists or feminists or any other SJW boogeymen. If anything, it&#8217;s a <i>lot</i> more likely to come from their ideological opponents. To paraphrase C.S. Lewis, you&#8217;re running around looking for a fire extinguisher while the ship is sinking.</p>

<p>No one claims or believes that trans women are physically identical to cis women. The claim is that both groups fall under the broader classification of &#8220;women.&#8221;</p>

<p>First off, no one is claiming that there should be no linguistic distinction between cis women and trans women, that&#8217;s why the terms &#8220;cis women&#8221; and &#8220;trans women&#8221; exist. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m cis, or even particularly want to be cis.</p>
<p>But getting to the meat of the issue: Maybe you&#8217;re right that categorizing that trans women as women requires a redefinition of the word. But by that logic &#8211; and this is basically the key point I&#8217;ve been making this entire time &#8211; <b>categorizing trans women as men would also require a redefinition of the word</b>.</p>
<p>The traditional definitions of male and female don&#8217;t take intersex and trans people into account at all. According to the traditional definitions, male refers to &#8220;male brain, male body&#8221; and female refers to &#8220;female brain, female body&#8221; and anything else wouldn&#8217;t fall into either category.</p>
<p>So when some conservative says that Caitlyn Jenner is just a dude in a dress, <b>he&#8217;s trying to &#8220;alter reality through naked force of will&#8221;</b> every bit as much as the trans activist who says that Caitlyn Jenner is actually a woman in every meaningful way, whether he realizes it or not. <i>Both</i> sides of the debate are trying to redraw the boundaries to suit their agendas.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I find it very hypocritical and self-serving when the anti-trans people claim to have science and objective truth on their side. The only thing they actually have going for them is a classification system that &#8211; while less accurate overall &#8211; matches a lot of people&#8217;s immediate intuitions better than the alternative, since it exclusively prioritizes the most obviously visible traits (as evidenced by The Nybbler and Aapje&#8217;s claims about how trying to use trans people&#8217;s preferred pronouns causes mental dissonance). But as increasingly more people accept the validity of trans identities, and as the social and aesthetic lines between men and women blur together even among cis people, the conservative model of gender categorization will lose even that one advantage.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It looks like it is once again time for me to link to the <a href="https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/bill/C-16/first-reading" rel="nofollow">actual text of Bill C-16</a>, the justification for all these horrible Canadian atrocities. </p>
<p>LadyJane&#8217;s characterization is correct. Le Maistre Chat&#8217;s interpretation of Canadian law is not. Consider, for example, the Canadian Bar Association&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cba.org/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=be34d5a4-8850-40a0-beea-432eeb762d7f" rel="nofollow">statement</a> on the Bill: </p>
<blockquote><p>Recently, the debate has turned to whether the amendments will force individuals to embrace concepts, even use pronouns, which they find objectionable. This is a misunderstanding of human rights and hate crimes legislation. </p></blockquote>
<p>Equivalent laws to Bill C-16 have existed at a provincial and territorial level in Canada since 2002. If utility monsters demanding protection from the nanny blanket of the state were a real problem, you would expect to be able to find examples from the Canadian legal system. Where are they?</p>

<p>But, if you don&#8217;t lead with the brain scans and instead lead with the feels and the rights and the self-identification, it is a very fair assessment of the situation and perfectly expected to not realize it&#8211;given that Bruce Jenner acted very much like a dude, being a competitive athlete and father, and looked unfeminine for much of the time he was feted for wearing a dress. </p>
<blockquote><p>Both sides of the debate are trying to redraw the boundaries to suit their agendas.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is very obvious that almost all people fit cleanly, on a physical level, into male or female categories. Behavior has considerably more variance, and only correlates with gender on net (that is, biological women have fewer masculine traits than feminine, but not always all or nothing) so it is not readily apparent that there is easily identifiable mismatch between biological mental inclinations and biological physiological function. Given this, I think one side is clearly pushing for a change in understanding. Reality lies at some point in between the prior understanding and the rhetoric of the advocates; but that doesn&#8217;t make it the case that both sides are advocating a change. </p>
<blockquote><p>The traditional definitions of male and female don’t take intersex and trans people into account at all.

<p>Yes, that is what the words do and should mean; it is more sociologically useful to have terms that mean &#8220;male/male&#8221; and &#8220;female/female&#8221; and then clarify in the &lt;1% of cases of mismatch than to strip the terms of meaning and be forced to clarify in the majority of cases or risk misunderstanding.</p>

<blockquote><p>3.) believe that someone who claims to have a male/female mind is both correct and honest.</p></blockquote>
<p>If &#8220;someone who&#8221; means &#8220;some people who,&#8221; that is already my belief, or at least my best guess, as I said in <i>Future Imperfect</i>. </p>
<p>If it means &#8220;anyone who&#8221; then I can&#8217;t believe it and you probably don&#8217;t either. Some people are dishonest and some people are mistaken in their beliefs about themselves. You might as well ask me to believe that two plus two equals five.</p>
<blockquote><p>
you’re still effectively making an object-level claim that they are not a woman (which is debatable, depending on how exactly you define “woman,” but I would strongly disagree), and furthermore that they actually just a delusional cis man (which is objectively false). </p></blockquote>
<p>You insist on treating your interpretation of the meaning of my choice of pronouns as if it meant what you want it to mean instead of what I have repeatedly explains it means. My referring to someone as &#8220;him&#8221; is making the claim that I perceive that person as male.</p>
<p>We all have to operate with maps that are simpler than the territory. Since I am speaking a language that only recognizes three categories, one of which (neuter) is inappropriate, I have to sort people into two categories, grammatically speaking. Some people don&#8217;t make a very good fit for either category. You insist that I have to speak as if I was sorting those people in the way they prefer instead of the way in which my mind actually sorts them. But my speech represents the contents of my mind, not of theirs.</p>
<blockquote><p>But I also don’t think it would be rude for B to correct them, or get upset with them if they continued doing it, or tell C that A really thinks of her as a dude.</p></blockquote>
<p>It would not be rude for B to point out that he sees C as female and try to persuade A to do the same. It is not so much rude as unreasonably arrogant for B to insist that A is making a mistake, that the only way it makes any sense to classify C is the way B does it. </p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t rude for B to inform C of A&#8217;s position, but I would have thought that you would be strongly against B doing so. You, after all, have been arguing that it badly hurts C to know that some other person regards C as male. If so, isn&#8217;t B being needlessly cruel by passing on the information?</p>

<p>No, using a gendered insult in the workplace would be explicitly in the same bracket as using a racial epithet in the workplace.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Misgendering&#8221; transgender indviduals is pretty explicitly in the same bracket as calling Rachel Dolezal white.  There is a very big difference between calling Rachel Dolezal white, and calling her [racial epithet].  And  grotesquely exaggerating the degree of insult associated with what is ultimately a factual disagreement, is not arguing in good faith.</p>

<p>Fine. But that&#8217;s not the argument that the social conservatives and the TERFs and all the other transphobes are making. Aside from a handful of people in a few intellectual playgrounds like the SSC forums, no one is saying &#8220;trans women aren&#8217;t women because they&#8217;re some other type of person that&#8217;s not truly male or truly female,&#8221; they&#8217;re saying &#8220;trans women aren&#8217;t women because they&#8217;re delusional cis men.&#8221;</p>
<p>And if you want proof, you need look no further than this very thread for a myriad of examples. For instance, CatCube said that &#8220;the demand that we acknowledge that men are really women and vice versa is absolutely bonkers,&#8221; which doesn&#8217;t exactly indicate a nuanced view of the limits of traditional gender classifications. And most of the posters in this thread seem to be taking his side.</p>
<p>If our culture and our language were different, and better acknowledged the existence of people who fall outside of strict definitions of &#8216;male&#8217; or &#8216;female&#8217;, then I wouldn&#8217;t find it so objectionable to be classified in a different category than cis women. But if people are going to insist that you can <i>only</i> be a man or a woman, and deny that any other possibilities exist, then you&#8217;re forcing outliers like me to round ourselves off into one of two imperfect categories. And if you&#8217;re going to force us into boxes like that, you&#8217;d better believe that we&#8217;re going to fight tooth and nail to at least be in the box that fits us better.</p>

<p>I understand. But I was explaining <i>why</i> so many trans people feel so offended and invalidated by misgendering. I wasn&#8217;t trying to misinterpret your intent, I was explaining how misgendering is likely to be interpreted by any given trans person.</p>
<p>Other people can&#8217;t read your mind, and most of them are not going to understand the <i>very</i> subtle distinction between &#8220;I&#8217;m making a claim that this person is objectively male&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;m making a claim that my mind perceives this person as male,&#8221; especially when there are so many people out there who actually do argue against the validity of trans identities on the object level. You can explain your thought processes to them, as you&#8217;ve explained them to me, and maybe some of them will be less offended after hearing your reasons. But I hope you can at least understand why they&#8217;d be so upset in the first place.</p>

<blockquote><p>Even the Canadian law doesn’t make it illegal to misgender someone. It doesn’t even regulate what universities can teach like Aapje was claiming. The university in question decided to set a standard, as it has every right to do; it wasn’t legally obliged to do so.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is not what I claimed! I noted that Title IX also seems to not make it legally mandatory to have an amateur legal system at universities, especially given that the courts seem to generally rule against the universities when people who are convicted by Title IX seek judicial redress and that a sane reading of the law does not require it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there was political coercion of universities to make them have Title IX panels, based on a claim by politicians that the law did require Title IX panels. Furthermore, there seems to be no move towards ending/fixing this travesty. At this point, a certain reading of Title IX laws, which makes little sense to me, has become very popular among many on the left. When certain beliefs are dominant, this can result in institutional oppression when people act on their beliefs, even if this is not legally mandated or allowed. </p>
<p>So at this point, I cannot trust that people will not go far beyond what is currently described as the clear meaning of C-16, because we&#8217;ve already seen people go far beyond the clear meaning of Title IX law and not be stopped.</p>
<p>Good faith in the absence of evidence is necessary to be able to cooperate. Good faith in the face of strong evidence of bad faith just makes you a victim.</p>
<blockquote><p>In practice, I think your particular concerns are very far removed from the actual reality of the world</p></blockquote>
<p>Title IX panels are actual reality. There are many horror stories about them that seem to check out. How can I believe you if you claim that something that already happened once, is unlikely to happen again?</p>
<blockquote><p>While I do worry a lot about the ever-increasing power of the state and the rising trend toward authoritarianism, I really don’t think the main threat to liberty is going to come from trans people or gay rights activists or feminists or any other SJW boogeymen.</p></blockquote>
<p>Title IX panels don&#8217;t seem to register as a major threat to individual liberty to you, nor do you seem to see them for what they are. This makes me doubt your ability to recognize actual threats.</p>
<p>You seem to worry about LGBT issues, but it seems clear to me that in the West, policies are moving in the direction of things becoming gradually better for LGBT. You have some hiccups and last minute backlash, which is temporarily unpleasant &amp; unfair to individuals, but it&#8217;s not a permanent worsening.</p>
<p>Perhaps you should explain what (out)group you think will be the true threat? Alt-right? Conservatives? White men? Capitalists? Some other group?</p>
<p>PS. AFAIK feminists are the largest self-identified group in the West who commonly believe in a conspiracy theory blaming the oppression of some identity groups on other identity groups. History shows that such an ideology is extremely likely to result in abuse of power against the groups that are claimed to be oppressive.</p>

<p>If that&#8217;s really all you&#8217;ve come up with, you haven&#8217;t been trying hard enough.  Here&#8217;s a few more.</p>
<p>5. They don&#8217;t like the unfairness of one group being asked to do all the work, for the sole benefit of another group who won&#8217;t even meet them half way on the issue.  The issue of pronouns and misgendering rarely comes up when a trans-man or trans-woman makes a consistent and good-faith effort to publicly present as their preferred gender, because nobody even thinks to ask for a blood test or genital exam before saying &#8220;her&#8221; about Sue-with-breasts-in-a-dress.  But people are being told that they have to use &#8220;Sue&#8217;s&#8221; preferred pronouns even if &#8220;Sue&#8221; is sporting a beard.  </p>
<p>The bit you complain about not understanding why some transgendered individuals are being treated differently from others, I&#8217;m pretty sure this is why.  And the number of Sues-with-beards may be tiny, but if that&#8217;s the hill you all are willing to die on&#8230;</p>
<p>6. While accepting that transgender identities are real in the sense that cis-male. cis-female, trans-male, and trans-female are four different things, they believe that the word &#8220;Woman&#8221; and its synonyms and associated pronouns best encompasses cis-female + trans-male, rather than cis-female + trans-female.</p>
<p>7. Given that traditional gender roles are increasingly seen as being arbitrary and archaic in every context other than &#8220;<i>usually</i> it&#8217;s one guy and one girl pairing up for sexyfuntimes&#8221;, they don&#8217;t like the cognitive dissonance associated with being told that now it&#8217;s <i>really important</i> that they get the right traditional gender label for this particular group of people.  Particularly when this demand is coming from the same people who told them to drop the traditional gender roles already.</p>
<p>8. They feel that, given the one remaining role for traditional gender labels as noted above, they are being asked to signal e.g. &#8220;I as a penis-bearing person hereby proclaim this other penis-bearing-person as a member of the class of people I like to have sexyfuntimes with&#8221;, when this is A: not true and B: well beyond the sort of white lie one can be asked to tell in the name of politeness.  And I&#8217;ve seen <a href="https://youtu.be/QDoeUnWpccA" rel="nofollow">too many</a> trans-women seeking validation of their sex appeal to cis-hetero men to discount this one.</p>
<p>9. If they don&#8217;t feel they are being asked to lie about their own sexuality, they see this whole apparently meaningless and arbitrary demand as an imposition of power for the sake of power, a means of establishing dominance and submission.  And yes, if one person gets to decide what words another person is allowed to use and with what meaning, dominance and submission have been established.  Which leads to,</p>
<p>10. There Are Four Lights, and they absolutely reject demands that they should see a fifth light no matter how pious the cause.</p>
<p>I think your attempt to model the whole of the opposition to your cause in this matter as religious fanatics, conspiracy theorists, and various sorts of fools, is leading you badly astray.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>AFAIK feminists are the largest self-identified group in the West who commonly believe in a conspiracy theory [&#8230;]</p></blockquote>
<p>As much as I dislike patriarchy theory, I don&#8217;t think &#8220;conspiracy theory&#8221; quite fits.  Even the least sophisticated versions seem closer to theories of class struggle, where there&#8217;s no centralized conspiracy to advance class interests but there doesn&#8217;t need to be, because everyone defaults to doing that anyway.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Aapje: I don&#8217;t think the real threat is any particular group, but rather a systemic trend toward immediate authoritarian responses to complex large-scale problems that require more subtle long-term solutions. The Trump campaign&#8217;s strongman rhetoric is certainly an example of that, but I&#8217;m a lot more concerned with things like the War on Drugs and the War on Guns and War on Terror and foreign interventionism and police militarization and the surveillance state. I definitely don&#8217;t think any major threats to liberty are going to come from either side of the culture wars; I find the more extreme SJWs to be obnoxious and the more extreme social conservatives to be utterly reprehensible on every level, but I don&#8217;t think either group has enough real social, political, or economic power to seriously threaten people&#8217;s civil rights. Furthermore, I think the people who are overly worried about either group are ignoring the real problem.</p>
<p>As for Title IX panels, universities can do whatever they want. That doesn&#8217;t mean they <i>should</i>, or that I necessarily approve of what the Title IX panels are doing (I don&#8217;t know enough about these cases to make a judgment either way), but I don&#8217;t think you can say they&#8217;re violating freedom of speech/expression/association, since the universities don&#8217;t have the force of the state behind them. In fact, the universities in question are exercising their own freedom of association by refusing to hire or serve people who don&#8217;t meet their standards.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@John Schilling:</p>
<p>5. To me, this comes across as somewhere between &#8220;women only deserve to be treated with respect if they&#8217;re attractive&#8221; and &#8220;black people only deserve to be treated with respect if they act white.&#8221; Maybe that&#8217;s assuming bad faith, and you just find it a lot easier to refer to people with pronouns that match your initial appearance-based assumption of their gender (which is basically what David Friedman and Matt M and The Nybbler all said). But in practice, that tends to mean that the only trans women who are treated with respect are those lucky enough to naturally look passable or wealthy enough to afford extensive cosmetic surgery.</p>
<p>If given a choice between making a moderate amount of people slightly uncomfortable because they don&#8217;t want to change their default mental heuristics, and making a small amount of people <i>extremely</i> uncomfortable just for existing, I&#8217;m going to favor the latter option.</p>
<p>6. At that point, you&#8217;re basically asking for &#8220;male&#8221; and &#8220;female&#8221; to be defined solely by chromosomes and/or genitalia. I don&#8217;t see any good reason for that. Unlike the previous example, you can&#8217;t even argue that it&#8217;s more intuitive this way, because you can&#8217;t tell what chromosomes someone has just by looking at them, and you usually can&#8217;t tell what genitals they have from a cursory glance either. Hell, for most of history, people didn&#8217;t even know what chromosomes were. And if you&#8217;re going by genitals alone, would trans people who&#8217;ve undergone sexual reassignment surgery be grouped together with cis people?</p>
<p>7. This is the kind of argument I&#8217;d expect from one of those goofy memes with the guy struggling to choose between two buttons. I already repeatedly explained why gender identity isn&#8217;t the same thing as societal gender roles. There is no conflict between accepting gender identities and rejecting gender roles, it&#8217;s a false dichotomy.</p>
<p>8. So what about trans people who&#8217;ve undergone sexual reassignment surgery? If you&#8217;re attracted to women with vaginas, then a post-op trans woman would fit that description too. Speaking more broadly, I&#8217;d agree that it&#8217;s probably a good idea for people to specify their genital configuration to potential sex partners, but I don&#8217;t see why that should prevent trans people from identifying as their preferred gender in public.</p>
<p>9-10. I&#8217;m not even going to bother responding to these.</p>

<p>&#8230;and that&#8217;s where I get off the train. We didn&#8217;t get very far. My queer theory coursework taught me to be quite suspicious of gender essentialism without a significant amount of evidence. I&#8217;ve seen the brain scans; they don&#8217;t suffice. I don&#8217;t think this is <i>quite</i> captured by (3), but I think you intended it to.</p>

<p>You mean like states making laws forcing people to use the bathrooms corresponding to the genders they were assigned at birth? Or not allowing trans people to change their legal gender marker? Or declaring trans people’s marriages null and void because their assigned birth gender doesn’t match the gender on their marriage license, <i>even in states and countries where gay marriage is legal</i>? Or denying trans people the option to start hormone treatments unless they live as their preferred gender for two years beforehand, as is the case in some European nations?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Controls Freak:<br />
If someone earnestly asked me that, I would try to explain that when trans people talk about having a female mind in a male body (or vice-versa), they&#8217;re using the term &#8216;mind&#8217; to refer to their neurological structure and the sex hormones that influence it, and they&#8217;re using the term &#8216;body&#8217; to refer to their outwardly visible physical characteristics. It doesn&#8217;t require one to believe in the concept of an immaterial soul.</p>
<p>As I already explained earlier in the thread: <i>I’m effectively using the word gender to refer to the neurological and hormonal traits that determine someone’s internal sense of gender identity (i.e. whether they see themselves as male or female or both or neither, not in terms of societal expectations and gender roles, but on a purely somatic level; to be even more specific, what sex their internal ‘map’ of their body views itself as).</i></p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Then I&#8217;d start to feel like they were arguing in bad faith, since that seems like quibbling over semantics in a deliberate effort to ignore my actual point. I suppose I would reframe my statement as &#8220;trans women have some physiological traits associated with cis women and some physiological traits associated with cis men, and the former have a greater impact on their psychological state even though the latter are more obviously visible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leaving aside that hypothetical, your actual argument seemed to be &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen all the evidence and I&#8217;m not convinced,&#8221; which makes me feel like there&#8217;s little point in trying to persuade you otherwise.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@TheNybbler: By that logic, I&#8217;d imagine it would be quite easy to label a lot of minority groups as &#8216;negative utility monsters&#8217; for wanting equal treatment. &#8220;Refusing to let black children attend the same public schools as everyone else would cause them harm&#8230; but allowing them in would cause some white families to be uncomfortable, so it&#8217;s more ethical to keep them segregated.&#8221;</p>
<p>@DavidFriedman: And where do you think these laws come from? The state, obviously, but why do you think politicians are so inclined to pass them? Who do you think wants them? I&#8217;d imagine there&#8217;s a very large overlap between &#8220;people who deliberately misgender trans people&#8221; and &#8220;people who support anti-trans legislation.&#8221; (That&#8217;s not to accuse you of supporting any of the laws I described; I don&#8217;t know your position on them and I don&#8217;t like to make assumptions about specific individuals&#8217; views. I&#8217;m just making a broader point that these two issues aren&#8217;t entirely unrelated.)</p>

<p>There might be an objection from negative utility monstering, but if  you are going to go down that route, you should not also go down the route of saying that using &#8220;she&#8221; or xhe&#8221; causes you mental anguish, because that is itself negative utility monstering.</p>

<blockquote><p>As much as I dislike patriarchy theory, I don’t think “conspiracy theory” quite fits. Even the least sophisticated versions seem closer to theories of class struggle, where there’s no centralized conspiracy to advance class interests but there doesn’t need to be, because everyone defaults to doing that anyway.</p></blockquote>
<p>I would call Marxism a conspiracy theory as well. I see a claim of extremely aligned behavior by an &#8216;oppressor&#8217; group that causes extreme harm to another group, where the actual evidence is extremely divergent with this claim, as the relevant criterion for what makes such theories truly dangerous*. This danger is even greater when it is combined with a strong dismissal, strongly divergent from the evidence, that significant harm is done collectively and/or individually by the other group to members of the &#8216;oppressor&#8217; group.</p>
<p>At that point you have the basis for extremist solutions being implementing that are not justified by the evidence. When those who implement these solutions also blind themselves to the negative consequences to the outgroup, there is then no mechanism that prevents a spiral into ever more extremist solutions, when the less extremist solutions don&#8217;t work (and they generally don&#8217;t, because those are based on falsely accusing the outgroup, so oppressing the outgroup generally won&#8217;t help).</p>
<p>Merely believing that the &#8216;oppressors&#8217; themselves must be oppressed because they are naturally disposed to oppress and assuming extreme bad faith on their part that results in their needs being framed as illegitimate, seems little different from the perspective of the &#8216;oppressors&#8217; to being treated badly because of a claim that they follow &#8216;protocols&#8217; or do other explicit coordination.</p>
<p>AFAIK, there is no overarching category/term for both the kind of theories that argue that there is explicit coordination with the intent to do harm and those that claim that certain people cannot help but oppress. So either I have to put effort into going into detail, like the above, or I have to make do with terminology that confuses some.</p>
<p>* And yes, I realize that my opposition to most feminism (most strongly the political, scientific and activist forms) is seen as the same by some, but I think that my claims are relatively well supported by the evidence.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Trump campaign’s strongman rhetoric is certainly an example of that, but I’m a lot more concerned with things like the War on Drugs and the War on Guns and War on Terror and foreign interventionism and police militarization and the surveillance state. I definitely don’t think any major threats to liberty are going to come from either side of the culture wars;</p></blockquote>
<p>On the one hand I agree with you that there are dangerous mechanisms that are problematic in themselves, because people can grab the levers of the machine and wreak havoc.</p>
<p>However, I also believe that ideology greatly influences how willing people are to grab those levers, make sure that their political opponents don&#8217;t get to keep the levers from being pushed too far and blind themselves to the evidence of the havoc that they are causing. The machine doesn&#8217;t just operate itself, someone has to run it. If a more moderate person operates a dangerous machine, that person will not maximally take advantage of what the machine can do. However, if extremists gain control, they will not restrain themselves.</p>
<p>So the way I see it, it is critical that extremists do not gain power over the machine, which depends on the ability of moderates to recognize and resist it. My impression is that the left is currently far less able to recognize and resist their extremists than the right. This is in no small part because the kind of dumb pattern matching that people tend to do to recognize evil, is based on object level comparisons, rather than judging ideas by more abstract principles. In other words, people can recognize unfair treatment of black people, women, gays, etc; far, far more easily today than they can recognize unfair treatment of white people, Asians, men, straight people, etc.</p>
<blockquote><p>As for Title IX panels, universities can do whatever they want. That doesn’t mean they should, or that I necessarily approve of what the Title IX panels are doing (I don’t know enough about these cases to make a judgment either way), but I don’t think you can say they’re violating freedom of speech/expression/association, since the universities don’t have the force of the state behind them.</p></blockquote>
<p>When the regulatory environment makes it unrealistic to not depend on federal funding, which in turn requires compliance with certain rules, you have &#8216;force of the state.&#8217; In practice, it seems that it is almost impossible to run a university without federal funding, which is logical, because doing so effectively means that those who fund the attending students have to double pay: both for the federal funding of the universities they don&#8217;t attend and for the one they do. Such an environment is inherently coercive (which doesn&#8217;t make it wrong, but which does not allow freedom of association to work as you claim).</p>
<p>I think that it is very dangerous to pretend that people have a choice, when they don&#8217;t actually do in a realistic sense. I don&#8217;t consider &#8216;of course you have the option to opt out, you just have to accept a severe decrease in your ability to compete with others&#8217; an acceptable outcome.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Fine. But that’s not the argument that the social conservatives and the TERFs and all the other transphobes are making. Aside from a handful of people in a few intellectual playgrounds like the SSC forums, no one is saying “trans women aren’t women because they’re some other type of person that’s not truly male or truly female,” they’re saying “trans women aren’t women because they’re delusional cis men.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Feel free not to respond, the thread is long and plenty of others are raising their own points. But I think the explanation of this is that the activists aren&#8217;t leading with brainscans and hormone measurements to prove the case, but emphasizing identity, feeling, and rights. People understand that mental defects are beyond an individuals control and are legitimately deserving of treatment if they can be objectively established. People can understand that there are individuals that don&#8217;t fit the categories.<br />
Many people will react strongly against being told that a manly man who felt like wearing a dress, seemingly out of the blue, is an &#8220;actual woman.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p> So what about trans people who’ve undergone sexual reassignment surgery? If you’re attracted to women with vaginas, then a post-op trans woman would fit that description too.</p></blockquote>
<p>Does sexual reassignment surgery give a woman who until recently had a man&#8217;s body a working womb? Because sex actually has a purpose, and if Transexuals are going to get offended by people who use the concept of gender to screen for potential mates, they lose out.</p>

<p>Sure, there&#8217;s a bunch of stuff on that list that would be troubling given blind enforcement. Getting arrested for &#8220;comments or conduct relating to a perception that a person is not conforming with gender-role stereotypes&#8221;? Going to prison for &#8220;Intrusive comments, questions or insults about a person’s body, physical characteristics, gender-related medical procedures, clothing, mannerisms, or other forms of gender expression&#8221;? Terrifying!</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not how the Canadian justice system works. Canadian law is big on case-by-case balancing of rights. See, for example, the OHRC&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-competing-human-rights" rel="nofollow">three-stage process</a> for evaluating competing rights claims, or <a href="http://www.carters.ca/pub/bulletin/church/2013/chchlb43.htm" rel="nofollow">this 2012 Supreme Court decision</a> about wearing the niqab while testifying. Judges are routinely expected to evaluate the reasonableness of claims, and balance various rights against each other.</p>
<p>Le Maistre Chat&#8217;s nightmare scenario can only come to pass if judges throw their principles out the window and go all-in on anti-discrimination law. That is prima facie implausible; if you want to make that claim, pointing at proclamations from the OHRC isn&#8217;t enough. You dismiss the caveats as mere disclaimers, but the Canadian justice system is very serious about those caveats. The burden of proof here is on the people who claim state power is being wielded as a protective blanket for trans people to find a real-world example. It it&#8217;s as bad as they say, it should be easy.</p>
<p>PS: <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1694958-54-dawson-v-vancouver-police-board-no-2-2015.html" rel="nofollow">This case</a> is the closest I&#8217;ve been able to find. I&#8217;ve read through the decision, and it seems careful, thoughtful, and proportionate. For example, consider pages 52-53: the Vancouver jail has a policy for determining whether claims of being transgender are legitimate, and the judge explicitly declines to call that policy discriminatory.</p>

<p>SJ adherents like to use thing-orientedness as a bludgeon, mostly because it&#8217;s effective.  Thing-oriented people know they&#8217;re thing-oriented, so you have a good chance of snowing them by asserting that the reason they don&#8217;t accept your claims is your thing-orientedness results in a blind spot.  This is not the same as actually being people-oriented.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Iain, OK, maybe, <em>maybe</em> Chat&#8217;s vague claims are false. Indeed, the decision of the OHRC to spell this out, both in 2014 and in response to Peterson is almost the opposite of her concerns about vague powers. But there is a big gap between her being wrong and Jane being right. I don&#8217;t mean to pick on Jane, since she seems to have been dragged into the Canadian topic, but you specifically defended her reading. Moreover, you said that it was useful to read the law, when that is exactly where she went wrong. For example, her failure to know that &#8220;discrimination&#8221; includes &#8220;harassment,&#8221; although that is hardly original to Canada.</p>
<p>But the unconscionable error is in the CBA document. The content of any particular law hardly matters when the CBA is lying to you.</p>

<blockquote><p>“trans women have some physiological traits associated with cis women and some physiological traits associated with cis men, and the former have a greater impact on their psychological state even though the latter are more obviously visible.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This sounds vague enough that we can likely swap in almost any condition which affects psychological state. It <i>certainly</i> doesn&#8217;t come with anything remotely close to the same rhetorical force of, &#8220;A person has the &#8216;mind&#8217; of a male/female,&#8221; which is why it seems like saying the latter is cheating.</p>
<blockquote><p>your actual argument seemed to be “I’ve seen all the evidence and I’m not convinced,” which makes me feel like there’s little point in trying to persuade you otherwise.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not really. It&#8217;s that I&#8217;ve seen the brain scans. I&#8217;m not convinced by them. That means that you can either proceed to explain why I&#8217;ve insufficiently understood the evidence from brain scans, or you could also point to additional evidence aside from brain scans which you think make the point as well. <a rel="nofollow"href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/02/04/open-thread-94-5/#comment-598581">If I were teaching someone about aerodynamics</a>, and they said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you can show lift over an airfoil via Bernoulli, because the flow doesn&#8217;t have to meet back at the trailing edge at the same time,&#8221; that doesn&#8217;t mean that they&#8217;re simply convinced that lift doesn&#8217;t exist and there&#8217;s not point in continuing. Instead, I have to go through the process of actually bothering to explain the details of the argument. Not doing so (especially when one suspects that his interlocutor is cheating, as above) is a pretty surefire way to not convince anyone.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>I get the impression that Peterson is not objecting to using a transgender person’s normal masculine or feminine pronouns, especially if they personally ask you to (i.e. referring to a female-presenting person as she/her and a male-presenting person as he/him) but to having it punishable by the government not to use whatever neologism a particular person wants used (ze, zer and things of that ilk).</p></blockquote>
<p>This is tangential to your point, but I think Peterson has evolved on this. Peterson said in the now-infamous Channel 4 interview a few weeks ago that he would use a person&#8217;s pronouns if they asked him to, but no one ever has. However, I&#8217;ve now seen some older clips where he&#8217;s said he wouldn&#8217;t. Either he had different cases in mind and the older clips failed to capture that (say, and I&#8217;m just speculating here, he&#8217;s personally opposed to using various coined pronouns but would use he, she, or they if someone asked him to), or he&#8217;s changed his mind about this.</p>
<p>That aside, I think you&#8217;re right both that his objection to that Ontario is framed in terms of free speech and that he has actual, cogent, perhaps decisive or perhaps weak arguments for his position.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t think that there has been much change. My memory of his earliest statements is that he would take things on a case by case basis. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGKkuoyDTew" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a recent video in which he says something similar. That&#8217;s not as definitive as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHd0V__0_yw" rel="nofollow">his answer to Newman</a>, but I suspect that he didn&#8217;t intend that answer to be so definitive, but to include gricean caveats. The assumption is not just a student, but that this is all relevant information, as opposed to a stunt intended to create conflict. (Of course, such a stunt would not have occurred before he was a celebrity.)</p>
<p>Whereas <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtsjMgnhQ1I" rel="nofollow">here</a> is an old clip in which he says that he would accept new, gender-neutral pronouns if they were accepted by society, and not just promulgated by activists.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Since we&#8217;re discussing person practice now: I&#8217;ve long considered using someone&#8217;s preferred pronouns a matter of simple politeness. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m committing myself to the belief that they &#8220;are&#8221; that gender by using the pronoun they ask me to, so I don&#8217;t feel any objection to so respecting their wishes.</p>
<p>Of course, if someone <i>does</i> think he&#8217;s committing himself to the belief that the trans person is that gender by saying it, or that in some important way he&#8217;s compromising his beliefs, I don&#8217;t see how I can say <i>that</i> view is empirically wrong and should be punishable by law. As several people have pointed out, analogies to various slurs don&#8217;t hold because he doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean anything disrespectful or harmful about it. I think this sort of approach to one&#8217;s speech is murky at best—most people, for instance, address priests and popes by their titles even if they think religion is nonsense—but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s grounds to call it hate speech.</p>
<p>Douglas, I&#8217;m at work right now but I can take a look at the clips later. I&#8217;m basing my conclusion he changed his views on an old clip from him talking to a Senator, I think? But yeah, I didn&#8217;t cite my sources here, so I&#8217;ll be checking clips!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve definitely heard the claim that he would be &#8220;denying their humanity&#8221; by refusing to use whatever pronoun they declared to fit them, with the implication that &#8220;denying&#8221; someone&#8217;s &#8220;humanity&#8221; is at least as bad as calling them slurs. And that &#8220;denial&#8221; of their &#8220;humanity&#8221; doesn&#8217;t get all affected by whether he meant to be disrespectful or harmful, and is entirely determined by the judgment of the person being described with the pronoun.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>FWIW, I found those clips by typing &#8220;jordan peterson pronoun&#8221; into youtube and watching the shortest clips. Since then I tried &#8220;jordan peterson senate.&#8221; The three short clips I found didn&#8217;t seem relevant. One of them starts with like «Why don&#8217;t you just use the pronouns?» but Peterson doesn&#8217;t really concede that he doesn&#8217;t.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Douglas,</p>
<p>Home now. I&#8217;ve rewatched the stuff and you may be right. From <a href="https://youtu.be/AvsPbOY5Lgg?t=138" rel="nofollow">a clip on the news</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Newscaster: But would you use alternate pronouns if a student asked you to?<br />
Peterson: I think I&#8217;ve made my position on that clear already.<br />
&#8230;.<br />
Newscaster: Would you use alternate pronouns?<br />
Peterson: No.<br />
Newscaster: And why not?<br />
Peterson: Because I don&#8217;t believe that other people have the right to determine what language I use, especially when it&#8217;s being backed by punitive legislation, and when the words that are being required at the constructions—they are artificial constructions of people I regard as radical ideologues whose viewpoint I do not share.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, <i>pace</i> Peterson I don&#8217;t think his position is clear just from this. It sounds like he might be saying he&#8217;d refuse gender neutral pronouns like ze/zir, or he might be saying he&#8217;d refuse to use a person&#8217;s preferred pronouns entirely; it didn&#8217;t touch on the latter case, so we don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/AvsPbOY5Lgg?t=345" rel="nofollow">In another one</a>, he says, &#8220;&#8230; I regard these made-up pronouns, all of them, as the neologisms of radical PC authoritarians&#8230;.&#8221; Again, it sounds like he&#8217;s taking issue with made-up pronouns.</p>
<p>And he seems to say the same thing around 4:30 in the first video you linked. So okay, I suppose this was his view all along, and I overinterpreted his rejection of the neologisms. <i>Mea culpa</i>.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You make some reasonable-sounding points but I&#8217;m a little skeptical of classifying misgendering someone via pronouns as &#8220;harassment&#8221;. (Disclaimer: I lean in favor of a workplace/campus rule forbidding misgendering someone.)</p>
<p>Harassment refers to direct and deliberate targeting of another person. That certainly does apply to some forms of misgendering (e.g. repeatedly making remarks about how (wo)manly someone is), but using pronouns is a semi-conscious aspect of communication that&#8217;s hard to avoid and usually doesn&#8217;t involve deliberation.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That&#8217;s why I specified &#8220;on a frequent and consistent basis.&#8221; I know that it&#8217;s not uncommon for people to misgender a trans person they just met, and I understand that slip-ups can happen from time to time, especially if the trans person in question isn&#8217;t particularly passable. That&#8217;s different from actively making an effort to misgender a trans person every time you talk to them or talk about them, as a deliberate statement that their gender identity isn&#8217;t valid.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Your central example doesn&#8217;t extend well to SCC, where as far as I can determine, the median position is &#8220;Gender is a made-up category&#8221;.</p>
<p>Which is to say, there is a position outside of pro-trans and anti-trans, which is that transgender isn&#8217;t referring to anything.  (As distinct from transsexual, which does exist in their framework, and which I won&#8217;t be getting into here.)</p>
<p>For this subset of people, &#8220;gender&#8221; doesn&#8217;t refer to a meaningful concept.  So, for an only somewhat related example I may regret, a man who wants to wear a dress isn&#8217;t violating gender norms, but rather sexist rules.</p>
<p>The distinction is both subtle and important, because it underlays a significant percentage of the angry debate on the matter.  To this group of people, &#8220;gender expression&#8221; and &#8220;gender conformance&#8221; is a kind of fundamental error in thinking, in treating a conceptual framework for understanding the way society interacts with sex (gender-sex, not the act) as if it is referring to a real and meaningful concept.</p>
<p>From this framework, gendered nouns refer to sexual characteristics, not to gender.  They are literally incapable of misgendering anybody because they don&#8217;t have any concept that maps to &#8220;gender&#8221; in their brain; it isn&#8217;t a characteristic they assign to people.</p>
<p>The &#8220;gendering&#8221; argument literally sounds to them like you are insisting they pretend people have different genitals, because that is literally what the words mean to them.</p>
<p>Some go along with it, even though they don&#8217;t actually understand it, because they understand that other people feel hurt by it.</p>
<p>Others, who prioritize Truth, fight the whole thing tooth and nail, because from within their framework, you are demanding they be dishonest.</p>
<p>(I lean towards the old-school framework of &#8220;Gender is something we ought to be tearing down, not building up&#8221;, because I think gender conformance is stupid, and I find many trans people incredibly frustrating because they just switch which role they are performing to, which looks to my perspective like escaping one prison by hiding in another.  But I don&#8217;t feel strongly enough about it to yell at the kids that they are doing it wrong.  At least they are experimenting with the boundary conditions of societal expectations, and maybe along the way they&#8217;ll figure out that they don&#8217;t have to fit into any box.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Thegnskald: You&#8217;re making the same mistake a lot of well-meaning liberals make (including me, back during my teen years), which is to confuse gender roles/expressions with gender itself. Gender roles and expressions (e.g. that men wear pants and women wear dresses, that men are more assertive and women are more passive, that men like video games and women like shopping) are societal norms, and I would agree that they could be considered made-up categories. But gender itself is distinct from those, and refers to one&#8217;s internal sense of self, their own feelings about their mind and their body. Gender roles and expressions are subjective, but gender itself is just as objective and ultimately just as rooted in biology as sex (i.e. visible anatomical sex characteristics).</p>
<p>If we took your rationale to its logical conclusion, then it would follow that in a world with no sexism and no gender roles, people would no longer suffer from gender dysphoria at all, and trans people would no longer exist. I find this highly doubtful, given the myriad of hard evidence showing that there are observable biological differences between trans and cis people. There&#8217;s even some (admittedly inconclusive) evidence that animals can suffer from gender dysphoria.</p>
<p>The fact that many trans people don&#8217;t actually conform to the norms and expectations of their &#8216;chosen&#8217; gender is also evidence that gender is not the same thing as gender roles. I&#8217;ve known plenty of masculine trans women and feminine trans men; the fact that they still felt the need to transition despite matching the expectations of their assigned birth gender indicates that there&#8217;s definitely something to gender beyond just societal norms.</p>

<p>&#8220;and refers to one’s internal sense of self, their own feelings about their mind and their body. Gender roles and expressions are subjective, but gender itself is just as objective and ultimately just as rooted in biology as sex&#8221;</p>
<p>is nonsense.  It&#8217;s a subjective experience that is objective?  No.  Insofar as we are describing the body, we are describing sex; dysphoria about one&#8217;s body, insofar as sexual characteristics are concerned, is what we used to label &#8220;transsexuality&#8221;, although the labels tend to be used pretty imprecisely anymore.</p>
<p>Gender dysphoria, as described by those who experience it, appears to be a social dysphoria &#8211; which is why it is so important to those who have it that they be gendered correctly.  It is literally the social protocol; it is the gender role.  Insofar as you care how other people gender you &#8211; insofar as your concerns are socially rather than internally rooted &#8211; we are talking about a social protocol, which is to say, the gender role.</p>
<p>Now, I am quite willing to admit to the possibility that there is yet another category, that I&#8217;ve been lumping into one of the others, but you&#8217;re going to have to describe it a little more precisely than &#8220;subjective objective experience having to do with the mind and body&#8221;, which just sounds like a combined category including elements of both gender and sex, because if you want other people to incorporate this categorization, you have to actually be able to explain what the categorization is and why it is important.  Don&#8217;t expect to convince them that this categorization is uniquely important and should supersede their own, however.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Gender roles and expressions (e.g. that men wear pants and women wear dresses, that men are more assertive and women are more passive, that men like video games and women like shopping) are societal norms, and I would agree that they could be considered made-up categories. <b>But gender itself is distinct from those, and refers to one’s internal sense of self, their own feelings about their mind and their body.</b> Gender roles and expressions are subjective, <b>but gender itself is just as objective and ultimately just as rooted in biology as sex (i.e. visible anatomical sex characteristics).</b></p></blockquote>
<p>This seems a bit hard to swallow. I don&#8217;t think that mental phenomena are in any sense fake, but they are certainly messier and less objective than gross anatomy. It shouldn&#8217;t be at all controversial that our own feelings about ourselves are shaped by our upbringings and cultures.</p>
<blockquote><p>If we took your rationale to its logical conclusion, then it would follow that in a world with no sexism and no gender roles, people would no longer suffer from gender dysphoria at all, and trans people would no longer exist. I find this highly doubtful, given the myriad of hard evidence showing that there are observable biological differences between trans and cis people. There’s even some (admittedly inconclusive) evidence that animals can suffer from gender dysphoria.</p></blockquote>
<p>Both the brain and the body are extremely plastic. There&#8217;s every reason to believe that environmental effects (e.g. how people are treated) can feed back into observable biological differences. That means that the presence of observable biological differences between groups of people does not imply that those groups must not have socially constructed definitions.</p>
<p>If you want to look for human universals you have no choice but to study people from as disparate cultures as possible. Unfortunately, most of the contemporary scientific establishment is very bad at doing that.</p>
<p>To put my cards on the table, I do think that in a culture with no sexism or fixed gender expectations that gender dysphoria would at the very least be significantly reduced in prevalence.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>as a deliberate statement that their gender identity isn’t valid.</p></blockquote>
<p>How about routinely using the pronoun in the way consistent with how you actually view that person? </p>
<p>Part of what bothers me about the whole &#8220;misgendering is harassment and should be preventing&#8221; idea is that it amounts to a claim by someone else over the inside of my head, a claim that I am obliged to think about someone in whatever way that person wants me to.</p>
<p>If I view someone as male, requiring me to use female pronouns in referring to him is requiring me to lie about my views, or alternatively requiring me to change my beliefs on someone else&#8217;s orders. Both of those strike me as ugly and objectionable things to do. I have no objection to using female pronouns for someone who I know is genetically XY but who I actually view as female, but that doesn&#8217;t describe all mtf transsexuals.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p> But gender itself is distinct from those, and refers to one’s internal sense of self, their own feelings about their mind and their body.</p></blockquote>
<p>That may be what you mean by the term, but it isn&#8217;t what I or, I think, most people mean by it, so you are demanding that other people change the meanings they assign to words to fit your preferences. </p>
<p>It also isn&#8217;t a very sensible way of using the term if the purpose is for me to decide what pronouns to use in referring to people, since your definition depends on facts not externally observable. If I refer to someone as &#8220;she&#8221; I want that to convey information about who I am referring to to whomever I am speaking to, which it doesn&#8217;t do if gender is a statement about what&#8217;s inside someone&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t work perfectly in a world in which conventional gender markers, such as clothing, don&#8217;t perfectly correlate with biological gender, but it works a lot better than your alternative.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Thegnskald, @Brad, @DavidFriedman: I realize my wording in the previous post was vague, and I understand how that can be confusing when dealing with loaded words like &#8216;gender&#8217; which lots of people define in lots of different ways.</p>
<p>So, to (hopefully) clarify: I&#8217;m effectively using the word gender to refer to the neurological and hormonal traits that determine someone&#8217;s internal sense of gender identity (i.e. whether they see themselves as male or female or both or neither, not in terms of societal expectations and gender roles, but on a purely somatic level; to be even more specific, what sex their internal &#8216;map&#8217; of their body views itself as).</p>
<p>I apologize if that&#8217;s still not clear, but it&#8217;s very hard to describe gender dysphoria to someone who doesn&#8217;t personally experience it. It&#8217;s more akin to somatoform disorders like phantom limb syndrome than to psychosocial or psychosexual disorders.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>So, to (hopefully) clarify: I’m effectively using the word gender to refer to &#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s fine as a description of how you use the word. But you seem to have been arguing that everyone else is obligated, morally if not legally, to assign pronouns to people on the basis of gender defined in that particular way. </p>
<p>As I already argued, that makes less sense than assigning pronouns on the basis of appearance and behavior, since those are externally visible and internal self-image is not.</p>
<p>If we all went around naked, it would make sense to assign pronouns on the basis of visible genitals, with a very few ambiguous cases. If we all went around with a list of chromosomes written on our foreheads, it would make sense to use &#8220;he&#8221; for XY, &#8220;she&#8221; for XX, again with a few ambiguous cases. But since the function of grammatical gender is to convey information to the listener, it makes no sense to base it on something observable only to the person being referred to.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>In response to LadyJane&#8217;s original reply to my comment: Yeah, I guess that&#8217;s fair, as long as it&#8217;s an &#8220;active effort&#8221;. This gets a <i>bit</i> muddy when it comes to repeatedly misgendering someone because one has to occasionally use pronouns and doesn&#8217;t want to cater to a viewpoint of transness that one doesn&#8217;t believe in &#8212; rather than <i>going out of one&#8217;s way</i> to use the wrong pronouns in order to make one&#8217;s point &#8212; but yeah. I tend to believe that a trans person&#8217;s pronoun preferences should trump other people&#8217;s comfort in using them anyway, however we use the term &#8220;harassment&#8221;.</p>

<p>Is this the standard view among researchers and trans-activists? I was of the impression that leaning heavily on the biological perspective wasn&#8217;t particularly popular and that self-identification was supposed to be the only standard?</p>
<p>(Also, what you call gender would probably be a lot less confusing if it was called &#8220;psychological sex&#8221; or something &#8211; because that&#8217;s what it appears to be. &#8220;Gender&#8221; is not a good word for clear communication.)</p>

<p>I think that the beliefs range all the way from &#8216;it&#8217;s a hard biological mismatch between the mind and the body&#8217; to &#8216;It&#8217;s a mismatch between the traits of the person and the gender role.&#8217;</p>
<p>The irritating part is that these very different beliefs all tend to get referred to with the same term: gender dysphoria. Even worse &amp; confusing is that many of those who see gender dysphoria as biological, see gender as referring to the gender role. Confusion guaranteed.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>LadyJane &#8211;</p>
<p>That sounds like an elaborate restatement of &#8220;transsexual&#8221;.  So what&#8217;s the difference between a transgender person using that definition and a transsexual person?</p>
<p>ETA:<br />
To reiterate my understanding of the categories, so we are on the same conceptual page: Sexual dysmorphia (transsexuality) is a feeling of discomfort centered around your body.  It is associated with hormonal and brain structure differences, and is usually, but not always, helped by surgery/transitioning.</p>
<p>Gender dysmorphia is a feeling of discomfort centered around how other people perceive you, and in the gender-mediated social interactions everybody engages in.  It is sometimes, but not always, associated with sexual dysmorphia &#8211; and in the last decade or so in particular has become much more common as an independent issue, whereas previously it was largely correlated.  It isn&#8217;t particularly helped by surgery/physical transitioning, and although social transitioning can mitigate the symptoms, it remains strongly comorbid with other illnesses such as depression, suggesting that in many cases there is an as-yet unidentified root cause separate from gender itself.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;d suggest at least some of the modern increase in gender dysmorphia is caused by a negative perception of the gender role one is born into &#8211; for example, a perception that male gender role conformance requires being sexually abusive &#8211; but that is pure speculation.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Thegnskald: As far as I can tell, the term transsexual refers to someone who&#8217;s actively taken steps to physically transition. It&#8217;s also a rather outdated term that I don&#8217;t really hear people using much anymore.</p>
<p>What you call &#8220;sexual dysmorphia&#8221; is what I&#8217;ve been referring to as gender dysphoria. What you call &#8220;gender dysmorphia&#8221; is a symptom that results from having gender dysphoria in a world with a strict binary gender classification. In a hypothetical world where there were no gender norms at all &#8211; to the point where everyone had gender-neutral names and exclusively referred to each other with gender-neutral pronouns, and the only time sex/gender came up at all was in regards to situations and issues where the actual physiological differences mattered &#8211; there would be no such thing as gender dysmorphia at all, but there would still be people with sexual dysmorphia.</p>
<p>And yes, the language on this topic is confusing and inconsistent and often loaded, which makes it difficult to discuss with people who aren&#8217;t familiar with the terminology. As John Nerst suggested, &#8220;psychological sex&#8221; would probably be a more accurate term for the concept that I&#8217;ve been describing with &#8220;gender.&#8221; When psychologists and trans activists say that &#8220;sex doesn&#8217;t always match a person&#8217;s gender,&#8221; what they really mean is &#8220;outwardly-visible physical sex characteristics don&#8217;t always match a person&#8217;s psychological sex.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@DavidFriedman: Well, that&#8217;s kinda my point, you <i>can&#8217;t</i> know someone&#8217;s true biological sex just by looking at them, since biological sex includes not only their visible sex characteristics, but also their &#8220;psychological (i.e. neuro-hormonal) sex&#8221; as well as genetic and anatomical sex characteristics that aren&#8217;t externally visible. There are people with Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome who are physically and psychologically identical to cis women, yet still have a Y chromosome; many probably go their entire lives without ever realizing that they&#8217;re intersex.</p>
<p>Since true biological sex is basically an unknown quantity (at least short of extensive medical testing), it&#8217;s best to simply refer to people the way they want to be referred to. If you don&#8217;t know what their preference is, then judge based on their presentation until you find out.</p>

<p>This does not logically follow.</p>
<p>True biological sex correlates with &#8220;what gender do you appear to be&#8221; with at something approximating 0.99.  Why isn&#8217;t it &#8220;best&#8221; to simply refer to people based on what gender they appear to be?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Matt M: As I said, if you don&#8217;t know what pronouns someone would prefer to use, then it&#8217;s perfectly reasonable to judge based on their appearance. I&#8217;m not saying that we should always use gender-neutral pronouns for everyone unless they specifically say otherwise, and I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything wrong with accidentally misgendering someone. But I do think someone&#8217;s personal preference should take priority over their appearance, where the two conflict.</p>
<p>In general, you&#8217;re correct, there&#8217;s about a 98-99% chance that any random person you see is the biological sex they appear to be. Among someone <i>actively claiming to be a different gender than they appear to be</i>, however, that chance decreases very sharply.</p>
<p>As of the most recent statistical estimates, 0.6% of people are trans and another 1.7% of people have other intersex conditions. Assuming there&#8217;s some overlap there, that&#8217;s roughly 2% of people who are neither biologically male nor biologically female. But if you see someone who looks like a man but claims to be a woman, the odds of them having gender dysphoria and/or another intersex condition is a lot higher than 2%, it&#8217;s probably closer to 99.2%.</p>
<p>A lot of these arguments seem to be built around this weird implicit premise that huge swaths of people are just pretending to be trans for attention or whatever, despite not actually having gender dysphoria. I find this assumption extremely bizarre and unlikely.</p>
<p>Also, even saying &#8220;we should judge people based on their appearance and presentation&#8221; is a big improvement (in my eyes) from the position a lot of others seem to be taking here, which is &#8220;we should always treat people as if they&#8217;re the sex/gender they were assigned at birth.&#8221; Your view wouldn&#8217;t result in misgendering a passable trans woman (and depending on how charitable you are, it might not even result in misgendering an unpassable trans woman who was clearly trying to present female), whereas someone like CatCube objects to <i>ever</i> referring to trans people by their chosen pronouns as a matter of principle.</p>

<p>Seconded.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also note that I&#8217;m prone to take someone seriously who makes a great deal of effort to pass, considers hormone therapy, surgery, whatever&#8230; as opposed to the people who call themselves &#8220;genderfluid&#8221; and basically do nothing but occasionally crossdress and browbeat anyone who doesn&#8217;t treat them as a beautiful and unique snowflake.</p>
<p>I feel the same way when it comes to homosexuality.  One can usually tell the difference between serious people who make a big commitment to live as openly gay &#8211; and the college girls who are &#8220;bisexual&#8221; to the extent that they&#8217;re willing to make out with other girls at frat parties if boys are watching &#8211; but that&#8217;s about it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>People say all sorts of stuff in the weirder corners of the Internet.  I used to know a guy who swore up and down that he was living out the plot of a harem anime &#8212; and not just any harem anime, but one of the ones with a highly specific ridiculous gimmick.  And that&#8217;s not even the strangest identity-as-performance-art bit I&#8217;ve come across, just the easiest to explain.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, I think that while &#8220;pretending&#8230; for attention or whatever&#8221; is probably gonna be vanishingly rare among emotionally stable adults, it leaves out whole swaths of possible motivations that have nothing to do with classical gender dysphoria.  It also leaves out the possibility of gender dysphoria arising (or at least being greatly amplified) for socially mediated reasons, which I would have scoffed at a few years ago but I now think is a real possibility.  And there are plenty of people out there who aren&#8217;t adults or aren&#8217;t emotionally stable.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>OK, we&#8217;re too deep in this subthread for me to respond to everyone&#8230;</p>
<p>@Nornagest: <i>Hayate the Combat Butler</i>?!</p>
<p>On passing well: some people do it, so I call them as I see them. The problem I keep encountering is males who put minimum effort into passing and bring down the power of hegemonic leftist social pressure on anyone at the party who doesn&#8217;t treat them as the special snowflake they want to be. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, they&#8217;re straight dudes who want the privileges West Coast cities and college towns give to lesbians.</p>
<p>On prevalence: I don&#8217;t buy that 1.7+ percent of the population is neither male nor female. Since the Agricultural Revolution, typical humans have lived in villages of Dunbar&#8217;s Number people, and there weren&#8217;t multiple intersex people in each village. There might be one &#8220;two spirit&#8221; per <i>numerous</i> villages, or males who wanted to be women might leave their villages and link up as the <i>hijra</i> <i>jati</i> (occupation/caste), but it wasn&#8217;t <b>that</b> common.<br />
This &#8220;empirics of history&#8221; argument is the same reason I don&#8217;t believe that 10% of men have always and everywhere been homosexuals. There&#8217;s got to be a socialization factor.</p>

I had a friend from the internet who claimed to have a hot nudist wife but didn&#8217;t bring her when we met in person, then went on to claim she gave birth to twins and the camera broke when they tried to take a family photo, but that&#8217;s mild in comparison.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Le Maistre Chat: Which do you find more likely: that a lot of gay/trans people pretended to be straight/cis when there were extreme negative consequences to being openly gay/trans? Or that a lot of straight/cis people are now pretending to be gay/trans, despite there being no real benefits to doing so, because the negative consequences for being openly gay/trans are no longer as extreme as they used to be? </p>
<p>Not to mention, trans people living in a society where there wasn&#8217;t even a concept of &#8220;transgender&#8221; would probably have a great deal of difficulty figuring out how to even contextualize their feelings of dysphoria. Also, plenty of intersex people aren&#8217;t actually aware that they&#8217;re intersex, even today, and I&#8217;d imagine that it would&#8217;ve been a lot less likely for them to find out without modern medical testing.</p>

<p>Disagree.  There are definitely <i>some</i> social circles in which identifying as gay or trans increases ones status significantly.  And plenty of non-social situations as well (college applications, job applications, diversity in procurement requirements, etc.)</p>
<p>And these spheres seem to be increasing, not decreasing.</p>

<p>If I understand you correctly, you are using &#8220;intersex&#8221; to cover a bunch of different things. A short list:</p>
<p>1. A hermaphrodite&#8211;someone with both male and female genitals.</p>
<p>2. A transsexual&#8211;someone whose body is unambiguously of one gender but who identifies as the other.</p>
<p>3. Someone with non-standard genetics. XXY is the most common but, as you probably know, others exist. Mostly such people appear as somewhat atypical males or females.</p>
<p>There may well be more I haven&#8217;t thought of. I should probably include a Tumtum, since the ancient Jews did (along with hermaphrodites&#8211;both raised puzzles for the application of religious law). But I&#8217;m not certain what one was and it probably is due to a problem that can be eliminated by modern medicine.</p>
<p>These different categories raise different issues, so lumping them together makes discussion more difficult.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qUY5CV9jjM" rel="nofollow">This video</a> may be illuminating. Danielle often wears a beard, has a super low voice, is balding and otherwise presents 100% like a man, but claims to be a transwoman. You can also see an apparent non-effort to appear female in the photos at the bottom of <a href="http://daniellemuscato.startlogic.com/bio--photos.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a>.</p>
<p>As you can see at Danielle&#8217;s site, this person seems to use the trans/female identity to get to speak on behalf of trans people/women in a way that a man would often not be allowed to, in the blue tribe. In fact, this seems to be Danielle&#8217;s career.</p>
<p>So it seems possible/likely that the trans identity gave Danielle access to a SJ advocacy career.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>despite there being no real benefits to doing so</p></blockquote>
<p>So, this is both exactly the kind of story that this account is for (Ridiculous, probably offensive to some, and definitely of the stripe that I know better than to tell at work), and relevant here.</p>
<p>A partner that I dated for roughly 4 years recently came out as nominally trans.  They&#8217;re still entirely physically female and have said they have no plans to physically or hormonally transition at all.  All of this comes on the heels of an official borderline diagnosis while having plunged deep into the fetlife scene.  Extrapolate at your leisure.</p>
<p>Where it gets interesting is that they say they&#8217;ve always been trans, but are only coming out with it now,  which means I was retroactively in a gay relationship for several years.  I presume they&#8217;re telling me this because they think it&#8217;ll get under my skin, cithet hegemonic scum that I am, but let&#8217;s be cereal for a moment here:  This is absolutely fucking hilarious!</p>
<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve been able to preface points with &#8220;As a gay man, I feel that&#8230;&#8221; in discussions with my other friends who&#8217;ve frequently pulled out this gambit in the past.  Whereas previously it would shut down discussion, because who am I to contradict the lived experience of my more fabulous compatriots?  But now it lets me meet that particular powerplay with an equivalent and continue speaking as an equal.  It&#8217;s eye opening.</p>
<p>Having never experienced the ability to make arguments that are privileged by virtue of the disprivilege of the speaker before, I can see the appeal!  At this point I can safely say that anyone claiming that there are not real social power benefits to having a dispriviliged identity in modern society is lying, full stop.  The power involved becomes apparent seconds after deploying it for the first time.  And while I&#8217;d prefer we all just ditched identity based power games altogether, I&#8217;m flexible, y&#8217;know?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@liskantope</p>
<p>That sounds like BS to me. Is there a health condition that makes it impossible to use hormones AND impossible to smoothly shave and impossible to grow out your hair or wear a wig and to wear a little makeup and &#8230;</p>
<p>Muscato also makes conflicting statements, for example, <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielleMuscato/status/805435217888575488" rel="nofollow">claiming</a> to be prevented from transitioning due to expenses and difficulty getting hormones, 6 months after claiming to have medical reasons to not be able to transition.</p>
<p>It seems extremely unlikely that one would announce in 2014 to want to gradually transition entirely without mentioning any medical issues that may prevent that and then know in December of 2016 that one cannot take hormones due to medical reasons, without actually trying to transition by taking hormones in the meantime. However, in that case it makes zero sense to claim in May of 2016 that one does not have access to hormones for multiple reasons. Are we supposed to believe that those multiple reasons all dissipated in less than 6 months?</p>
<p>The evidence that I see suggests insincerity much more than another explanation.</p>

<p>Yes, it does, otherwise it&#8217;s not freedom of speech. &#8220;You&#8217;re free to criticize the regime, comrade, but that doesn&#8217;t free you from the consequence of being sent to the gulag.&#8221;<br />

<p>How can you reach a public consensus for that idea when you censor all debate on that topic? Because there&#8217;s certainly no broad consensus that “trans people’s gender identities aren’t valid” is a false statement.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think the interpretation of &#8220;freedom of speech&#8221; is one which applies to government suppression of speech only.  Employers are free to fire you (and your children can be kicked out of school, stores can refuse you service, etc, etc) if you express (or are suspected of subscribing to) undesirable views &#8211; or in this case, fail to express the views deemed correct.</p>
<p>Obviously, this kind of lynch mob mentality can be just as stifling for political discourse and debate as governmental censorship, but by using this definition, we can still claim &#8220;free speech&#8221;.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;d be much more sympathetic to such arguments if the people proposing them used them across the board. E.g., &#8220;Freedom from discrimination only covers government discrimination; as long as the government isn&#8217;t passing laws discriminating against a certain race, private businessmen should be free not to serve them.&#8221;</p>
<p>(And, on a more quibbling note, I think &#8220;your children can be kicked out of school&#8221; would still count as government suppression of free speech, at least if you&#8217;re one of the vast majority of people whose children go to state schools.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That becomes a little more awkward when the employer is the government. (as in this case since she&#8217;s an employee of a public university getting government funding)</p>
<p>Should the government be allowed fire employees for publicly campaigning for the opposition party in their free time? </p>
<p>How about for failing to criticize the opposition parties position in a video shown to a class while on the clock?  </p>
<p>&#8220;Freedom of speech does not equate to freedom from the consequences&#8221; becomes vastly vastly more worrying when the state employe a sizable fraction of the working population and can suddenly inflict &#8220;consequences&#8221; on employees who don&#8217;t toe the party line hard enough.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I would agree, and would strengthen what you said: free speech applies to <b>government</b> suppression of speech, direct or indirect.</p>
<p>Direct: blasphemy laws, anti-sedition laws, etc.</p>
<p>Indirect: &#8220;if you hire people who hold <b>those</b> views, or won&#8217;t hire people who hold <b>these</b> views, you can be punished&#8211;you may find it difficult to get business licenses, or be fined, or&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very OK with any private business deciding that it doesn&#8217;t want employees who refuse to use its customers preferred pronouns working there: but if the government requires it to ensure that it&#8217;s employees do so, that&#8217;s not free speech.  (I&#8217;m similarly OK with private businesses only hiring people who think the whole notion of transgender is nonsense.  Or only people who think the only proper breakfast is congee.  It&#8217;s not the government&#8217;s business.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Adrian, @Ketil: I&#8217;ll freely admit, I&#8217;m exactly the kind of libertarian that Scott complains about in <a rel="nofollow"href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/07/29/against-signal-boosting-as-doxxing/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/07/29/against-signal-boosting-as-doxxing/</a>. He thinks it contradicts the spirit of libertarian ideals, if not the letter. I think his view unfairly favors the people making unpopular arguments, and limits the freedom of speech and freedom of association of the people responding to them. The marketplace of ideas is exactly that, a marketplace, and there are (and should be!) consequences to failure there. Those consequences just shouldn&#8217;t be enforced by the state at gunpoint.</p>
<p>And among the scientific and medical establishment, there is indeed a broad consensus that “trans people’s gender identities aren’t valid” is a false statement, as I explained in my reply to Winter Shaker above. That consensus might not exist among the general populace, but who cares? 42% of Americans don&#8217;t believe in evolution either, that doesn&#8217;t mean the issue is still up for debate in any serious academic context.</p>
<p>@The original Mr. X: If it makes any difference, I think anti-discrimination laws should only apply to government agencies and contractors.</p>
<p>@Murphy: I would say that, as a general rule, government employers should not be allowed to fire employees for not supporting the current political establishment. I would also say there should be exceptions for cases where not supporting the current political (or academic/scientific establishment) would directly interfere with the function of the job. For instance, I would expect a press secretary who publicly denounced the politician he was supposed to be representing to be fired in short order, and I wouldn&#8217;t expect a government-funded climate research institute to hire a climate change denialist. Likewise, I think it&#8217;s acceptable for a government-funded university to punish a professor who taught outdated psychological theories like Blanchardism.</p>
<p>@SamChevre: I mostly agree. Although, as I explained above, I think deliberately and constantly misgendering a specific individual is tantamount to harassment, and I would consider that valid grounds for a civil suit.</p>

<p>What is a valid gender identity is not a question on which the scientific and medical establishment has any special expertise. If what I mean by &#8220;gender&#8221; is genetic gender then their gender identity is not valid. If what I mean by &#8220;female gender&#8221; is &#8220;does not think of self as male&#8221; (etc.) then it is.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a tad suspicious that all the exceptions you carve seem to favor one political ideology while all the things you take a hard line of disfavor it&#8217;s opponent. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s like a chirstian who claims to be all about areligious principles and tolerance but happens to support laws that happen to ban the traditional garb of other religions but carves out exceptions for any times when their own religion calls for wearing things that would otherwise violate the rules.</p>

<p>Is there a nicer way to express that someone seems to be carving carefully around their own ideology or markers for their own social group? </p>
<p>deciding that saying things [popular with their own social group] and unpopular with [ideological group popular with the other 50% of the population] are where free speech is right and proper to apply </p>
<p>but that  saying things [unpopular with their own social group] and popular with [ideological group popular with the other 50% of the population] is where we need to take and stand and suppress things.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>No, because the thing you&#8217;re trying to express is itself not nice. You&#8217;re assuming that the other side is intentionally favoring unprincipled solutions. A lot of people instinctively prefer rules that favor them in the moment, but that&#8217;s different in intent from &#8220;yeah I&#8217;m carefully making unprincipled rules here so my side wins&#8221;. The instinctive group is engaged by building a thought experiment where the rules apply against them, the intentional villain group is engaged by discussion about the futility of villainy, but you only engage the audience by announcing &#8220;you unprincipled villain!&#8221; (a real villain wouldn&#8217;t care or would think you a loser, and someone unintentionally doing it would be discouraged from maintaining the same good faith and civility in debate as before the allegation)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@LadyJane</p>
<p>You seem to view my framing of the issue as a free speech issue to be a disingenuous attempt to argue for the right to harm a person.</p>
<p>However, what we see in the Shepherd case is that she was not reprimanded for misgendering anyone, nor for showing a clip where a person was misgendered, but rather for showing a clip where Peterson argued on the meta level. I agree with you that, at the object level, certain behaviors should be outlawed/punished/etc. However, I believe that it is crucial for a free society that one should always be allowed to argue that the law is wrong.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, arguing that a law is wrong, without breaking the law, does no direct harm, except the offense that is taken. For example, while a person who is denied a job for her race is harmed in the opportunity that she has been denied, merely hearing someone advocate for the right to deny her a job does not in itself cause direct harm. Indirect harm, like other people being convinced that the law is wrong and undoing it, is something that in my view best handled by having the opponents make their best case and having society make a democratic decision. Abandoning that solution generally leads to a &#8216;benevolent dictatorship&#8217; (in the eyes of those who rule), which is often not considered very benevolent by the ruled.</p>
<p>As such, my worry about the implication to free speech is not (just) a way to resist a certain object-level policy, but rather, it is what I care about most. In fact, it is the conflation of the object level with the meta-level, which we see in the Shepherd case, in your comment and among a certain portion of society, which makes me far more wary to extend protections. What I see is exactly the opposite of what you worry about: that arguments at the object level are used to push through bad changes on the meta level.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>A second issue is that I don&#8217;t believe that protecting people is as black &amp; white as you claim. For example, let&#8217;s take your claim that we should ban people from arguing that a particular race is inherently superior or inferior. The problem here is that this can be counter to the scientific evidence and (therefor) make it harder for us to help people.</p>
<p>I believe that my light skin makes me objectively inferior at living in places where the sun shines very brightly, while it makes me objectively superior at living in places where the sun shines less. Disallowing me to argue this, effectively makes it impossible for me to argue that people with light skin color should more often use sunscreen &amp; that people with dark skin color should more often take vitamin D supplements, even though such race-based advice seems appropriate.</p>
<p>Another example that demonstrates the difficulty in making general rules, is that people in some black subcultures like to call each other by the n-word. People are diverse, with different culture, different relationships to each other, etc; so it is hard it make good rules. Perhaps transwoman 1 never wants to be called a &#8216;he,&#8217; but transwoman 2 actually prefers that transphobes call her that, so she knows to be wary of them, rather than have the prejudice affect her in more subtle ways that are hard for her to see, but which do much harm. So instead of top-level rules, it may be better to push such rules to the communitarian level as much as possible, based on the self-organizing ability of people.</p>
<p>I also don&#8217;t particularly trust authorities, other than judges, to properly navigate these nuances, especially since (significantly) erring in the direction of a stifling environment tends to be the most pleasant to them (easier and requiring less effort, at least, at first).</p>
<p>While I agree with you that it is not necessarily wrong for organizations to pick a side, it is important that we then allow multiple sides to exist in separate organizations. Where this is not possible, we should demand neutrality (or at least, democratically backed decisions) as much as possible. This is true in particular for public and semi-public organizations, because there is only one state. I consider colleges to be semi-public organizations, given that even &#8216;private colleges&#8217; tend to get much of their funding from the state &amp; that we see in practice that the state leverages this to force the colleges into adopting certain policies.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Lady Jane:</p>
<p>In the US, the first amendment also applies to government-run schools (state universities, for example), so a state university probably could get in first-amendment trouble for imposing rules restricting what viewpoints were welcome on campus.  I have no idea how that works in Canada, though.  </p>
<p>On the object-level questions you mentioned, I think you are making a tradeoff, and you should be open about that tradeoff.  </p>
<p>a.  On one side, some discussions, questions of fact, or intellectual inquiries will offend the hell out of some people.</p>
<p>b. On the other side, suppressing those discussions, questions of fact, or intellectual inquiries will probably block off some paths of learning new things about the world.  </p>
<p>As a pretty simple case of this, consider the theory of evolution.  To advocate for this theory was to call into question the most deeply held beliefs of a big chunk of the population, including most of the students at any university at the time it was beginning to be taught and researched.  A lot of authorities wanted to suppress these discussions and inquiries, either to avoid offending these people, or for fear that undermining traditional beliefs about religion and morality would lead to a lot of social problems.  But if those efforts had been successful, we would be enormously worse off right now.</p>

I believe Peterson is on the record as saying he supports the current Canadian system &#8211; he&#8217;s OK with banning speech, but not with compelled speech, I think. </p>
<p>So, rather amusingly, a &#8220;free speech crusader&#8221; in Canada holds basically the same opinion as someone against free speech in the US.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>If someone kept insisting that one of their cis male co-workers was a woman, and exclusively referred to them by female pronouns, that would be seen as extremely rude and unprofessional behavior, and could easily get that person fired if they continued to do it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Because if they did that with one person and with no one else, it would be seen as bullying (and it would be).  </p>
<p>Someone who adopts, as a general framing of the world, the idea of &#8220;gender is not a social construct&#8221; and chooses to refer to everybody based on the pronouns of the gender they were born with is doing no such thing.</p>
<p>The former is a bully who is picking on one person and deserves to be punished.  The latter is someone who simply has a different worldview.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If someone adopts, as a general framing of the world, the idea of &#8220;non-whites are subhuman inferior races who are undeserving of respect,&#8221; that doesn&#8217;t make it socially acceptable for them to start insulting every African and Asian person they meet.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re free to believe whatever you want, and to express those beliefs, but when you start treating specific people disrespectfully because of those beliefs, then you&#8217;re engaging in targeted harassment. (There&#8217;s a reason that this forum prohibits misgendering specific posters, despite allowing debate over the validity of trans identities in general.)</p>

<p>So if you treat people who don&#8217;t believe in evolution disrespectfully because of your beliefs about the subject&#8211;make it clear that you think they are scientifically ignorant&#8211;you are engaged in targeted harassment?</p>
<p>If you treat people who believe that gender is defined biologically disrespectfully, insist that they are ignorant people defying a correct scientific consensus&#8211;which is pretty close to what you have just been doing&#8211;that too is targeted harassment?</p>
<p>I am not entitled to have people respect me. The inside of their heads, which is where their view of me resides, belongs to them. Nor am I entitled to have people lie about their beliefs to keep me from being offended by them.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If I had a co-worker who didn&#8217;t believe in evolution, and I kept referring to him as &#8220;creationist&#8221; in every single interaction with him, and prefaced every statement about him by saying &#8220;he&#8217;s a creationist,&#8221; then yes, that would count as targeted harassment and most employers would agree. That might seem like an extreme example, but if you&#8217;re misgendering someone on <i>every single occasion</i> in which you talk to or about them, then it&#8217;s every bit as relentless and pervasive as the situation I described.</p>
<p>People are not entitled to respect. But I would say that they&#8217;re entitled to being treated respectfully, or at the very least, entitled to not being treated with active disrespect on a constant basis.</p>

<p>Are you a rationalist? If yes, pls say with me:</p>
<p><i>If Blanchard&#8217;s theory is right<br />
I desire to believe that Blanchard&#8217;s theory is right;<br />
If Blanchard&#8217;s theory is wrong,<br />
I desire to believe that Blanchard&#8217;s theory is wrong;<br />

<p>(Litany of Tarski adapted)</p>
<p><i>What is true is already so.<br />
Owning up to it doesn&#8217;t make it worse.<br />
Not being open about it doesn&#8217;t make it go away.<br />
And because it&#8217;s true, it is what is there to be interacted with.<br />
Anything untrue isn&#8217;t there to be lived.<br />
People can stand what is true,<br />
for they are already enduring it.</i></p>
<p>(Litany of Gendlin)</p>
<p>Both those debates are as yet far from settled &#8211; you find contemporary experts on both sides &#8211; so it is very premature to treat them like evolutionism vs creationism. It is dangerous for science, for truth-seeking and problem-solving, to treat unsettled debates as settled for the side you preffer and impose your prefference on all researchers, to accept it or risk ostracism. </p>
<p>If there are really no genetic IQ differences between races, then no genes but more and more environmental factors will be discovered, until all the IQ gap between races will be explained and those in charge will know how to make it dissapear completely by environmental interventions.</p>
<p>But if there are in fact some genetic IQ differences between races and those in charge proclaim that there are not, after all possible environmental factors are discovered and eliminated, a (somewhat reduced) IQ gap is still there and there&#8217;s nothing you cand do about it as long as you mantain your paradigm. But if scientists (are allowed to) consider that there may be genetic differences, then they can think of genetic interventions that can succesfully close the gap.</p>
<p>Similarly, if Blanchard&#8217;s theory about the two types of transwomen is false, if type 2 MTF trans (that he called &#8220;autogynephiles&#8221;) are actually similar with type 1 MTF trans (that he called &#8220;homosexual transsexuals&#8221;), only more repressed, so that they accept themselves and transition later, then  the best strategy would be to discover them earlier, at 18-20, when a really succesful transition may be still possible.</p>
<p>But if Blanchard&#8217;s theory about the two types of transwomen is true, if the two types of MTF transsexuals are really different phenomena with different causes, maybe transition will still be the best solution for type 1 MTF trans (who transition early and successfully, passing quite easily as women) and a different solution (maybe an anti-dysphoria pill) may be found for type 2 MTF transsexuals, who transition late and have big difficulties in passing as women (not only physically but even psychologically they are very atypical for women: they are frequently programmers and/or atheists, groups in which women are visibly underrepresented).</p>
<p>Sorry if I made any language errors &#8211; I am not a native English speaker.</p>

Of course I sometimes don&#8217;t understand how other people work &#8211; for example I don&#8217;t understand why you seem to believe I am trolling. You didn&#8217;t explain what (do you consider) I did wrong, what rule I didn&#8217;t follow. Scott didn&#8217;t say that this is a &#8220;no culture war thread&#8221; and the culture war subjects were touched by others before me. Controversial subjects are touched frequently by Scott himself and by many commentators &#8211; and you proclaimed your suport for Marxism without anybody accusing you of trolling, if I remember well (if not, sorry). So what seemed trolling to you?</p>
<p>As I said, I am not an American. I come from a quite different culture (Eastern Europe).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Bringing up an unrelated and highly contentious topic which is itself, although not entirely banned, on the &#8220;tread carefully&#8221; list, as evidenced by it&#8217;s most common nomenclature being banned terms.</p>
<p>I get that a certain group of people use it as a litmus test for whether or not somebody is objective and rational enough to have a civilized discussion with.</p>
<p>I also get that it doubles as a Beck&#8217;s Razor, which is to say, something that pisses people off to the point where they can&#8217;t make coherent arguments and &#8220;lose&#8221; by default.</p>
<p>Neither is appropriate in this context, and the latter is just a more elaborate and self-justified form of trolling.</p>
<p>ETA: Which is to say, it is the fact that you brought up an unrelated culture war topic out of nowhere, in an ongoing culture war topic, which reads as blatant trolling.  There is literally no reason to bring it up.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p><i>&#8220;It is dangerous for science, for truth-seeking and problem-solving, to treat unsettled debates as settled for the side you preffer and impose your prefference on all researchers, to accept it or risk ostracism.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also dangerous for science to treat debates that are mostly settled as being completely unsettled just because there&#8217;s some doubt about some of the exact particulars. It&#8217;s dangerous to act as if both sides of a debate are equally valid when the evidence strongly favors one over the other, just to maintain some artificial sense of fairness and balance. That&#8217;s why you have people saying that the verdict on climate change isn&#8217;t out yet, despite the fact that 97% of climate scientists believe it&#8217;s real. Or schools that try to &#8220;teach the controversy&#8221; about creationism and evolution, as if both are equally likely.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>despite the fact that 97% of climate scientists believe it’s real.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m curious. Have you read the article that claim is usually based on (Cook et. al. 2013)? Do you know what the substance of the claim is?</p>
<p>I ask because most people who refer to it haven&#8217;t and don&#8217;t, which points to part of the problem with your position. The mechanisms by which something gets viewed as the truth all well informed people know are quite unreliable, leading people to hold views with considerably greater certainty than the evidence supports. That problem is increased when there is pressure, legal or social, not to argue against the current orthodoxy.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@DavidFriedman: I&#8217;m aware that, among the 97% of scientists who agree with anthropogenic climate change, there&#8217;s a great deal of debate about the degree to which climate change is anthropogenic vs. natural, as well as the severity of both climate change itself and the consequences likely to result from it. I&#8217;ll admit to being something of a &#8220;lukewarmist&#8221; myself, and I generally think our responses to climate change should be tempered by other (economic, political, social, etc.) concerns.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s exactly what I mean about not treating debates as completely unsettled just because there are some points of doubt and disagreement. 97% of climate scientists might not agree on everything in regards to climate change, but they all agree that the hard denialist position is wrong. Evolutionary biologists might have some difficulty explaining how particular species or organic structures evolved, but they all agree that the answer isn&#8217;t &#8220;God created the Earth and all of its lifeforms in 7 days.&#8221; And neuropsychologists might not know the exact mechanisms that cause people to be homosexual or transgender, but they know there&#8217;s definitely a very strong biological component there and it&#8217;s not just sociocultural.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@LadyJane:</p>
<p>There is a creationist biochemistry profesor named Michael Behe. According to Wikipedia, he claims <i>&#8220;that some biochemical structures are too complex to be explained by known evolutionary mechanisms and are therefore probably the result of intelligent design.&#8221;</i> Also according to Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote><p>Behe&#8217;s claims about the irreducible complexity of essential cellular structures have been rejected by the vast majority of the scientific community,[4][5] and his own biology department at Lehigh University published an official statement opposing Behe&#8217;s views and intelligent design.</p></blockquote>
<p>But I don&#8217;t remember ever hearing about Behe being fired or having his course canceled for expressing his ideas, being harassed by furious student mobs or having his children cruelly ridiculed online by cyberbullies just because they are his children. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I can be sure that the scientific consensus about evolution is a real consensus: scientists have nothing to be afraid of in their personal life if they publicly reject evolution, so they publicly support it because they privately sincerely believe in it.</p>
<p>You said that:</p>
<blockquote><p>universities should not endorse something like Blanchardism as the correct theory or even as a possible correct theory, not just because it’s offensive, but also because <b>it’s just plain wrong (at least according to the vast majority of the modern scientific and medical establishment)</b>. It’s the same reason that universities shouldn’t endorse creationism as correct or possibly correct.</p></blockquote>
<p>Link please? You could easily provide a link to prove that creationism and climate change denial are rejected by &#8220;the vast majority of the modern scientific establishment&#8221; &#8211; could you do the same about &#8220;Blanchardism&#8221; as you called it? Can you prove it is 97% consensus, like that about climate change? Or at least 90% consensus? If you find, let&#8217;s say, around 60% consensus, that doesn&#8217;t mean &#8220;the vast majority of the modern scientific establishment&#8221;, that means the theory is still under debate.</p>
<p>Of course, we won&#8217;t find many public supporters of &#8220;Blanchardism&#8221; among US academics &#8211; but  that isn&#8217;t surprising at all, when its most known American supporter, prof. J. Michael Bailey, had his children cruelly ridiculed online by some trans cyberbully (his course about sexuality at Northwestern University was canceled, but for a seemingly unrelated reason).</p>

<p>The 97% wasn&#8217;t a count of climate scientists. It was a count of article abstracts. And it wasn&#8217;t that 97% of the abstracts said warming was anthropogenic, it was that of the abstracts that expressed an opinion on the subject&#8211;a minority&#8211;97% said or implied that humans were one of the causes.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t refute the point you make, that very few climate scientists believe human action has no effect on climate, but it does support the point I was making, that factoids about such issues, such as the one you referred to, provide low quality information, hence it is risky to base one&#8217;s views of what issues are or are not settled on them. </p>
<p>You wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>That’s why you have people saying that the verdict on climate change isn’t out yet
</p></blockquote>
<p>A view you apparently agree with, as do I. </p>
<p>You have very few people saying that humans have no effect on climate and I doubt that if anyone does say that it&#8217;s to &#8220;maintain some artificial sense of fairness and balance.&#8221; More likely it is some combination of true belief and contrarianism.</p>
<p>But you do see lots of people treating unsettled debates about climate science as settled, many of them treating as obviously true claims that go far beyond the IPCC reports. And you saw the same thing on population issues fifty years ago.</p>

<p>I stand corrected. Thank you for the clarification. But I think my larger point still stands.</p>
<p>At the risk of delving far too deep into abstractions: Imagine there are two theories on a subject, Theory 1 and Theory 2. An <i>overwhelming</i> majority of scientists agree that Theory 2 is definitely false, and even if the truth is somewhere in-between, it&#8217;s going to be much closer to the Theory 1 side of the argument. Now imagine some &#8216;clever&#8217; skeptic decides to argue that &#8220;since scientists can&#8217;t choose between Theory 1.0-A, Theory 1.0-B, and Theory 1.25, and there&#8217;s a small minority of scientists who even believe Theory 1.5, that means <b>the issue isn&#8217;t settled yet</b>, so Theory 1.75 or Theory 2.0 could be true too, they&#8217;re all equally valid!&#8221; I would consider that kind of argument to be ignorant at best and intellectually dishonest at worst, and I certainly wouldn&#8217;t consider it to be in keeping with the principles of rationality.</p>
<p>Reader&#8217;s initial post, the one with the litanies, strikes me as being analogous to that kind of &#8216;logic.&#8217;</p>

<p>I thought about dropping the too inflamable subject of race and IQ, but after my post is accused of being &#8220;ignorant at best and intellectually dishonest at worst&#8221;, I am forced to come back at it.</p>
<p>From a <a href="http://lepo.it.da.ut.ee/~spihlap/snyderman@rothman.pdf" rel="nofollow">Survey of Expert Opinion on Intelligence and Aptitude Testing</a> by M. Snyderman and S. Rothman, collected in 1984 (page 141):</p>
<blockquote><p>The source of the black-white difference in  IQ. This is perhaps the central question in the IQ controversy. Respondents were asked to express their opinion of the role of genetic differences in the black-white IQ differential. <b>Forty-five percent believe the difference to be a product of both genetic and environmental variation</b>, compared to only 15% who feel the difference is entirely due to environmental variation. Twenty-four percent of experts do not believe there are sufficient data to support any reasonable opinion, and 14% did not respond to the question. Eight experts (1%) indicate a belief in an entirely genetic determination. </p></blockquote>
<p>From its more recent replication, <a href="http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/2013-survey-of-expert-opinion-on-intelligence.pdf" rel="nofollow">2013 survey of expert opinion<br />
on intelligence</a> by H. Rindermann, T. R. Coyle and D. Becker (page 16):</p>
<p>Sources of U.S. black-white differences in IQ</p>
<p>0-40% of differences due to genes: 42% of experts<br />
 0% of differences due to genes: (17% of experts)<br />
 <i>[1-40% of differences due to genes: (25% of experts)]</i><br />
50% of differences due to genes: 18% of experts<br />
60-100% of differences due to genes: 39% of experts<br />
 <i>[60-99% of differences due to genes: (34% of experts)]</i><br />
 100% of differences due to genes: (5% of experts)<br />
M=47% of differences due to genes (SD=31%)</p>
<p>(the lines in [] are calculated by myself from the other lines, by simple aritmetic, the others are quoted)</p>
<p>So, as you can see, not only the debate is really not settled yet, there is no consensus about that subject, but when the scientists are surveyed anonymously, a very different picture emerges than the one media presents us as &#8220;the scientific consensus&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll write a different post about the (lack of) scientific consensus about &#8220;Blanchardism&#8221;, because if I put more than 2 links in a comment, it ends in spam.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The &#8216;scientific consensus&#8217; is probably becoming less reliable and harder to accurate gauge due to increasing academic homogeneity. This can result in broadly held biases, but also in people refusing to speak their mind, out of fear of being punished for stating things that are not acceptable to most progressives.</p>
<p>Note that this argument is often interpreted as a complaint about a lack of conservatives at colleges, but the evidence actually shows that moderates are declining just as much as conservatives, which is far more worrisome than if conservatives would be replaced by mostly moderates.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s part of the problem. Another part is that, because &#8220;scientific consensus&#8221; is used as a political weapon, there is an incentive for people who care about an issue to try to get in a position to control what statements are made by scientific organizations.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I also only found out about this recently, thought of bringing it up on the next OT but wasn&#8217;t sure if I wanted the responsibility of causing the comments section to explode 😛</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll just copy-and-paste what I posted the other day on Tumblr:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m kind of surprised that I haven’t seen any mention on Tumblr or on Slate Star Codex of this audio tape (which I ran across on YouTube in connection with Jordan Peterson), which was secretly recorded by a young grad student who had been summoned to be reprimanded by the professor running the course she was teaching along with some diversity ombudsmen. This was in reaction to an informal complaint they had received about the fact that she showed a brief YouTube clip of Jordan Peterson arguing about gender-neutral pronouns, which she had neither endorsed nor condemned. (It came out later that no actual complaint, either formal or informal, had been submitted to that crew from a student – it had come from a representative from some campus LGBTQ center who had heard one student expressing concern about it in casual conversation.)</p>
<p>Several partially-developed thoughts about the whole scandal and particularly this audio clip. On the one hand, this is the starkest evidence – from a primary source! – of the kind of SJ-flavored suppression of ideas from even being voiced at universities that more and more people are expressing concern about. I consider myself generally pro-trans-rights* and am taking more issue with Dr. Peterson’s views the more of his content I’ve seen in the last few days. But I still find listening to him worthwhile in that it makes me think critically about points I may not have considered and to sharpen and refine my “generally pro-trans” views on the complex questions involved with gender identity. I can understand that certain clips of his rhetoric might be distressing to some trans people (I don’t think she picked one of the more provoking ones), but to claim that the act of merely exposing the students to a snippet of Dr. Peterson is a form “gendered violence” or denying trans students the right to “be human”, seems like quite a stretch – in my less charitable moments, I’m even tempted to call it absurd.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have some disagreements with the grad student Lindsay Shepherd’s point of view as well. My biggest issue is with her statement that “in a university, all perspectives are valid”. The first time she said it, I chalked it down to a poor explanation of her view due to the stress of being put on the spot, but she repeated it later. No, not all perspectives are valid, or at least not equally valid, and I’m not in favor of presenting them as such at a university. The “all perspectives are valid” mentality reminds me of the rhetoric coming from advocates of teaching creationism Intelligent Design in schools (”Teach both sides of the controversy!”). There is no way to present all the perspectives out there – even all the ones with a significant amount of clout in the public discourse – in  neutral and even-handed way. A university instructor’s choices of which points of view to teach have to be informed by the scholarly merit of each point of view out there. Yeah, certain areas of academic inquiry might be stifled by bias in academia – I’m getting more and more worried that this is the case in some social science departments – and this is a problem. But just tossing out “All perspectives are valid!” neither proves that this bias is happening nor solves this problem.</p>
<p>A much more minor and subtle criticism I would make of Shepherd’s words is that I’ve heard her at a couple of points in interviews expressing an attitude that roughly goes “I like listening to people like Jordan Peterson even if I disagree with him, because I find people like that interesting and their ideas fascinating to ponder, it’s something I really enjoy doing.” On the surface this seems all right (and I came dangerously close to expressing the same attitude a couple of paragraphs up!), but the way she said it does sort of open her up to the criticism of sounding “privileged”, and perhaps rightly so. What is a fascinating academic semi-abstract concept to one person might be existentially earth-shaking on a primal emotional level to another, and it seems like a good idea to always keep that in mind. (I will say that she comes across as a very well-meaning person, and apparently she’s only 22-ish. I probably sounded an awful lot like her when I was her age, and I may sound too much like that at times even today.)</p>
<p>Finally, a major aspect of the issue that I think isn’t emphasized enough is that when these types of scandals happen, unequivocal denunciation and persecution from the Left runs the risk of driving the person at the center of it in a conservative direction, quite possibly directly into the arms of the alt-right! That’s what appears to have happened with Damore after being suddenly thrust into the spotlight in the wake of the whole Google fiasco. I hope that Shepherd manages to avoid that path, but she does seem to be getting more and more friendly towards Peterson… and she has stated, “I considered myself left-leaning, and I kind of still do, but also… I’ve also been tempted by the idea of like, maybe I should just like, join the right? They’re being so welcoming to me. Yeah I should just join the right.” I hope hearing her say this gives her left-wing attackers some pause.</p>
<p>*inasmuch as it’s clear what that even means; trans issues are a subject I’ve been a bit shy about discussing but I may lay out my general picture of it in an effortpost soon</p></blockquote>

<p>This sounds like the standard <i>privilege</i> argument meant to suppress all opposing opinions: &#8220;Oh, sorry, you&#8217;re not oppressed enough to weigh in on this discussion, so come back when you agree with me. Check your privilege, by the way!&#8221;</p>
<p>Being &#8220;privileged&#8221; does not mean you&#8217;re wrong, and being &#8220;unprivileged&#8221; does not mean you&#8217;re right – and that&#8217;s assuming that the concept of &#8220;white/male/<i>whatever</i> privilege&#8221; is even valid. Lindsay Shepherd is a woman and a vegetarian, but apparently that doesn&#8217;t earn her enough victim points to be allowed to open her mouth on this matter.</p>
<blockquote><p>What is a fascinating academic semi-abstract concept to one person might be existentially earth-shaking on a primal emotional level to another, and it seems like a good idea to always keep that in mind.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why, and to what effect? For some people, vaccinating children is &#8220;existentially earth-shaking on a primal emotional level&#8221;, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we shouldn&#8217;t explain how unreasonable and dangerous anti-vaxxing is.</p>

<p>I was making (as a side comment) a &#8220;much more minor and subtle criticism&#8221; of the tone and diction Shepherd used when talking about her academic interest in hearing Peterson&#8217;s take on trans issues. Regardless of the position Shepherd was trying to argue (in this case the meta-position of saying &#8220;these issues are interesting and I like to expose myself to all sides&#8221; which I&#8217;m completely on board with), she could maybe have chosen her words with a bit more sensitivity. There&#8217;s a big difference between that and saying she should sit down and shut up.</p>

<p>I believe you, and I&#8217;m sorry that I misinterpreted your intent.</p>
<p>I do think, however, that what you wrote comes very close to &#8220;she&#8217;s privileged and therefore should be very careful not to sound offensive&#8221;. It&#8217;s very difficult not to offend <i>some</i> oppressed, victimized group out there. Shepherd&#8217;s comment (<i>“I like listening to people like Jordan Peterson even if I disagree with him, because I find people like that interesting and their ideas fascinating to ponder, it’s something I really enjoy doing.”</i>) is harmless and well-intentioned in my ears.</p>
<p>Do we really <i>have to</i> be so careful to avoid even well-intentioned statements, for fear that someone with too thin skin might feel offended? <i>Can</i> we be so careful and still have any kind of reasonable public debate about any controversial topic?</p>

<p>This sort of thing usually ends up as an isolated demand for extreme rigour. Members of the recognised victim groups can get away with saying all sorts of things because they&#8217;re oppressed, but people like Peterson and Shepherd have to frame their statements in the most circumspect and platitudinous way possible, because anything that could be construed as offensive or privileged will be, and will be used as an excuse to ignore them or worse.</p>
<p>(Not saying that this is what Liskantope is trying to do, but it is how the debate seems to pan out in practice.)</p>

<p>Thank you thank you thank you for making this point.</p>
<blockquote><p>What is a fascinating academic semi-abstract concept to one person might be existentially earth-shaking on a primal emotional level to another, and it seems like a good idea to always keep that in mind.</p></blockquote>
<p>This sounds to me like an argument for content warnings. As I understand them, folks like Haidt (and to a lesser extent Peterson) broadly think content warnings, and being able to opt out of potentially very distressing material, is a bad idea, and that folks should instead become stronger so they can face it. What frustrates me about this is that it feels like a giant false dichotomy to me: surely you can <i>encourage</i> trans folks to encounter Blanchard-Bailey or whatever while still providing them content warnings so that they can opt out if they feel they need to. So I agree Shepherd sounds a little privileged there, but at the same time this is totally something that academics and professors should be doing, and more importantly a practice they should be exposing students to, too. If some folks, on some topics, don&#8217;t want to subject themselves to that, let them opt out <i>so that</i> we can still actually discuss ideas.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t worry about this, because I think that those kinds of questions really aren&#8217;t in the purpose of free and rational inquiry, but cultural warfare. </p>
<p>1. Not using a pronoun can be valid to a point, but it can also be used to dehumanize a person by denying them the right to their own name. If you refused to call a straight man &#8220;he,&#8221; that&#8217;s really not for any good reason is it?</p>
<p>2. The two genders thing&#8230;look, no offense, but apart from pregnancy and body structure you end up in a huge morass of trying to gender activities and feelings common to both sexes. Strict gender roles are a straight jacket, especially when used against those who transgress them.</p>
<p>3. Abnormal is a loaded word. Uncommon, maybe, but you are now running into the problem of defining normal as a discrete thing, and why it is good. Chesterton in Eugenics and other Evils said that being healthy is more a relation of different qualities than a state in itself. You could argue the same thing for being normal, which makes labeling abnormal a person is dicey, because they often just have similar qualities to normal people in different relations.</p>
<p>4. I&#8217;m critical religious belief is &#8216;real&#8217; (not really.) Does that give me carte blanche to argue it in a college class, or freedom from discipline if I don&#8217;t shut up about telling the religious members in class they are essentially deluded morons? I think you don&#8217;t worry about law as a punishment when you are civil.</p>
<p>5.Well, tbh this sounds like wanting to be able to explain religious belief or political belief through a personal, pet ideology, like freudianism. Especially since the particular system is a hair short of calling people perverts in practice. Might as well say religious people believe because they get off on being controlled by an authority figure, it&#8217;s about as scientific.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It is mostly socially acceptable to argue for (4) and (5) reasonably or unreasonably in a university as long as the religion in question is Christianity. The &#8220;unreasonable&#8221; arguments are the price we pay to be able to have &#8220;reasonable&#8221; arguments. This is a good trade-off overall and should apply to almost every topic that could come up at a University.

		<div class="comment-body"><p>As someone who&#8217;s spent much of their life in academia, I guarantee you, if any professor ever told a Christian student that their beliefs were objectively false and called them a &#8220;deluded moron,&#8221; they would be fired in a fraction of a heartbeat. This whole Jordan Peterson debacle would look like a minor scuffle in comparison. I know social conservatives love to think of themselves as oppressed, but religious institutions actually do have a lot more social power than trans people do. If anything like the premise of &#8220;God&#8217;s Not Dead&#8221; actually happened in real life, that university would probably be sued into oblivion.</p>
<p>And as I&#8217;ve already explained ad nauseum throughout this thread, free speech laws only protect people from government censorship. They don&#8217;t prevent employers from firing people, they don&#8217;t prevent schools from treating certain viewpoints as objectively wrong, and they certainly don&#8217;t prevent social backlash and damage to one&#8217;s reputation.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>A professor who calls a student a &#8220;deluded moron&#8221; (over any belief, not just Christianity) is bullying them, so it&#8217;s not surprising they&#8217;d get fired. If a professor said that Christianity was false in a less obnoxious way, or presented their lectures in a way that assumed the falsehood of Christianity, they&#8217;d be extremely unlikely to suffer any ill consequences.</p>

<p>As someone who has spent virtually his entire life in Academia, I can assure you that that is not true. If a professor did that in class and it came to the attention of his dean he might  get spoken to, advised not to behave like that. Or he might not, depending on the school, the professor, and the dean. If he was a tenured professor in the U.S. he could not be &#8220;fired in a heartbeat&#8221; and he probably could not be fired at all. </p>
<p>If all he did was to say that the views were objectively false and imply that anyone who believed them was deluded, without making a point of being rude to a particular student, there would probably, in most schools, be no consequences for him. </p>

<p>I agree. But the particular case that was being discussed occurred in a government school, and free speech laws in the U.S. do limit the degree to which government employers can fire employees for their speech acts. That may not be true in Canada, where the case actually occurred.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That they&#8217;d get fired is perhaps an exaggeration, but most professors are not in the habit of antagonizing students, as student complaints and parent complaints are headaches very much to be avoided. On the current topic, I am in philosophy and so know a lot of philosophy professors. Most of them are atheists. Most of the ones I know try to avoid revealing their own religious views in class (and saying someone&#8217;s deluded for believing in God would be a bit of a giveaway that one is an atheist). Not all of them, to be sure; I do happen to know Dan Dennett, but I&#8217;m inclined to suspect that even he is less aggressive in advocating atheism in his classes than in his books, just because that seems to be understood by everyone to be the way things are done.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I spent basically all of undergrad loudly saying exactly that to everyone religious (not one of my prouder moments in hindsight.)  I was not a professor, but note that I never once was asked to stop (other than quite nicely by some of the religious students) or punished in any way.  </p>

<p>&#8230; that was really out of the blue. Can you elaborate, because right now it looks like you&#8217;re trying to stir up extra culture war topics to no purpose?</p>
<p>[And in my admitted very limited experience when Muslim college students get insulted by random people they do the same thing other college students do &#8212; ignore them/move away/disengage, or ask them to stop. Haven&#8217;t seen this in a lecture hall situation afaik &#8212; but I wouldn&#8217;t notice it unless a friend told me about this afterward.</p>
<p>Edit: although my experience is based on people I hung out with or class mates&#8230; which probably heavily selects for conflict avoidance behaviors in public settings.</p>
<p>Extra edit: I used &#8220;getting insulted&#8221;, which is more general than Andrew&#8217;s description, because I can&#8217;t think of in person confrontations over religion that I&#8217;ve witnessed between college students.]</p>

<p>No, I said it to all religious people, essentially. I probably got the most anger / backlash about Muslims, but no actual consequences.  (This was in 2005-2009 before lese majeste applied to Islam.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Comrade&#8221; is probably exactly right.  Anthropology is one of the fields where there&#8217;s still a live Marxian tradition &#8212; though this means less that Marxian anthropologists are going to be agitating for a communist revolution and more that they&#8217;re going to be seeing things through a lens descended from historical materialist ideas.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not even necessarily a bad lens.  I took some archaeology classes in school from a guy that subscribed to it, and found them fairly insightful and surprisingly un-Culture Warry, although its focus on economics and class dynamics to the exclusion of other aspects of culture sometimes struck me as limiting.  Guess it&#8217;s hard to wage the culture war when everything you&#8217;re learning about takes place in the archaic American Southwest before anyone within four thousand miles had seen hide nor hair of a Spaniard, though.</p>

<p>Oh, I know. Historical materialism may or may not be a bad lens, depending on whether the academic is trying to stir up trouble with it. Marvin Harris even used it to defend what Westerners would otherwise consider wacky superstitions about , as the book title goes, <i>Cows, Pigs, Wars and Witches.</i></p>

<p>The one anthropology class I took (on folklore) also didn&#8217;t seem very Marxist at all, but then not clear how the two would overlap much &#8212; e.g. taking the whole proletariat as a folk group doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense.</p>

<p>I was going to respond saying I&#8217;ve been in academia for about a decade now and you&#8217;re trying to pull a fast one on me by claiming experience you assume I don&#8217;t have&#8230; but David Friedman beat to the punch with his multiple decades. Plus the other responses.</p>
<p>And I was not claiming that religious people are oppressed or anything silly like that (EDIT: referring only to U.S. Christians in U.S. colleges obviously, some religious groups in some places are oppressed). But you can say Christianity is false or that it&#8217;s the opiate of the masses or read some passages from Richard Dawkins and it will be totally ok, and your university bosses aren&#8217;t going to give you a talking to. The rules that lead to this outcome are good general rules and no new exceptions are currently needed.</p>
<p>You are talking about freedom of speech <i>laws</i>, but I am talking about <i>Freedom of Speech</i>. Freedom of Speech is much more important than just as a government rule. The idea for it didn&#8217;t fall from the heavens with the first amendment. It&#8217;s important as a cultural ideal for fostering debate in a liberal society.</p>
<p>And just so we&#8217;re totally clear, I am an atheist and I&#8217;m fine referring to people as &#8220;ornate buildings&#8221; if they really feel strongly enough about it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>As a datapoint, in my own time college I had a professor who was, er, obviously not impressed with Christianity&#8217;s truth claims &#8211; this was ten years ago now, so I can&#8217;t give you an exact quote, but many times in class he outright stated or heavily implied that Christianity was obviously false and anyone who still held to it was obviously deluded. He never suffered any consequences. </p>
<p>Nor should he have, I think. I&#8217;m a believing Christian, but I never particularly minded his statements, because he was a brilliant professor (although not an ideal teacher at all). Getting offended over someone&#8217;s acerbic personality and trying to shut him down would have cost the university one of its better minds.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>At a slight tangent, consider an older but somewhat analogous issue.</p>
<p>Catholics do not believe in divorce. Nelson Rockefeller, governor of New York, got divorced and remarried. Is a believing Catholic required to refer to his second wife as &#8220;Mrs. Rockefeller&#8221; even though he doesn&#8217;t believe she is? As his wife?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Rudeness and the definition of words are matters of social consensus. By the socially accepted definition of &#8216;lie&#8217; it is not one to use words and usages as they are socially defined even if those definitions conflict with some sort of internal idiosyncratic definitions.</p>
<p>Mrs. Rockerfeller was Mrs. Rockerfeller and Mr. Rockerfeller&#8217;s wife by the lights of the society that speaker was living in. If that society&#8217;s definitions and values were so totally incompatible with the speaker&#8217;s private metaphysics he was unable to bear living in it or fulfilling his duties as a polite member of that society, he was entitled to withdraw from it and find a society more suited to his own values. Perhaps in Vatican City. He was also entitled to try to convince the other members of that society that his definition was better and ought to be adopted. </p>
<p>But until and unless he convinced them, and if he chose to stay and chose to deliberately transgress the socially constructed rules of behavior of the society he was living in then the social consequences that flowed from those transgressions were entirely deserved.</p>
<p>This idea that one is entitled to be shockingly rude because he believes something strongly and no one else is entitled to treat him poorly for having been shockingly rude is nonsense. An (alleged) strongly held belief is not a plenary license to violate social norms. If you feel so strongly than bear the consequences of insisting on your beliefs over those of everyone else.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Rudeness is an odd way to frame a difference in moral beliefs. You’re saying that they should implicitly endorse a belief they vehemently disagree with for the sake of politeness. I’m too tired to think of an example right now but that kind of thing could be used against your beliefs as well.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think rudenesss is quite an appropriate framework. There&#8217;s a notion among those of a certain type of personality, prevalent but my no means exclusive to &#8217;round here, that claims that speaking Truth is the ultimate good. To a certain extent that&#8217;s fine, it&#8217;s you&#8217;re right to follow your Truth down a road that leads you to break taboos, violate norms, and offend people. But that very same right applies equally to the rest of us. We can decide to (privately) sanction you. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t support a set of norms that says that you can be rude to me because that&#8217;s where your Truth leads you, but I am not allowed to respond to such rudeness because I have to respect the sacredness of your following your deeply held beliefs.</p>
<p>If you come knocking on my door at 8AM in the morning to tell I&#8217;m a sinner and I&#8217;d better repent, you&#8217;ve been very rude to me and I&#8217;m going to treat you accordingly. I don&#8217;t especially care if you think God wanted you to knock on my door. That&#8217;s not relevant to me. The same thing if you ostentatiously refuse to address my mother as Mrs. So-and-so because you think God doesn&#8217;t want her to be addressed that way.</p>
<p>Like I said, I wouldn&#8217;t excuse religiously motivated rudeness. But at least it is a closer case. After all we excuse even murder under the doctrine of deific decree. But the case of pronouns is so much weaker. It is rudeness based in nothing more than an insistence on using private prescriptivist definitions of words. There is nothing more obviously socially constructed than words. How can it possibly be a &#8216;lie&#8217;, the avoidance of which purportedly justifies rudeness, to use a word in comporting with its descriptivist definition? Is it a lie to use gauntlet to mean &#8220;a form of punishment in which people armed with sticks or other weapons arrange themselves in two lines and beat a person forced to run between them&#8221;?</p>

<p>I suggest that the fact that you have to convert my example, where someone fails to describe a person in a way he believes to be false, into that one, is some evidence that you are arguing with a bad conscience&#8211;that the case I gave doesn&#8217;t feel rude to you, so you have to convert it into one that does.</p>
<p>Consider the case of a couple who are living together without marriage in a society with traditional views of the subject. Making a point of telling them that they are living in sin would in most circumstances be rude.

If you keep reading you’ll find your example repeated. But thanks for telling me what I really think, I guess. </p>
<p>Are you familiar with the case of Plaid Cymru legislator expelled from Wales’ devolved parliament after referring in a speech to “Mrs. Windsor”? Do you consider that behavior perfectly fine and the expulsion and pressure to refer instead to Queen Elizabeth or Her Majesty unfair?</p>

<blockquote><p>The entire goddamn argument is about what words mean, hidden in a moralistic argument based on the idea that one side is emotionally hurt when words aren’t used in the specifically prescribed way that they understand them.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d say it isn&#8217;t really about what words mean, since no one is going out and citing corpuses. But I wholly agree that the moralistic argument is a shell that doesn&#8217;t make much sense. I don&#8217;t see what the deep moral question is supposed to be on the anti-accommodation side. The fundamental disagreement seems to be more aesthetic than anything else.</p>
<p>I meant what I said about rudeness being socially constructed. That&#8217;s what the dumb jokes about &#8220;I identify as Napoleon&#8221; miss. A single individual can&#8217;t unilaterally create a norm like that. Look at DF&#8217;s latest hypo &#8220;Consider the case of a couple who are living together without marriage in a society with traditional views of the subject.&#8221; In most contexts, in that society it probably wouldn&#8217;t be rude to refuse to refer to the lover as a wife, but in some bohemian subculture within that society it might be.</p>
<p>If you want to disagree about what the prevailing politeness norms of particular venues actually are, I suppose those are thousands of little debates we could have. But I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;d be much of a point. What I took away from the &#8220;Mrs. Rockefeller&#8221; question was a situation where it is concededly the overwhelming social norm to refer to her that way (see LadyJane&#8217;s post below which matches my experiences) and the question is whether private disagreement was sufficient to turn rudeness into non-rudeness in that circumstance.</p>

<p>It is not a norm at a societal level, however, it is a norm in specific subsections of society.</p>
<p>If we are falling back on the &#8220;social norm&#8221; argument, then we are left with a problem, because we have two competing social norms here.  Worse, one of the norms is extremely new, and a huge part of the argument is trying to get the remaining hold-outs to buy into the new norm.</p>
<p>The substantive issue being, I am not certain the hold-outs don&#8217;t outnumber the people who have already agreed to it.</p>
<p>So it isn&#8217;t at all clear that we can even say it is rude, in this social sense; at best we can say it is rude in certain social situations in which everybody is agreed.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>In general, it seems doubtful whether an objective standard can even exist. It seems that pretty much everyone believes that there are norms that should be universally enforced &amp; norms on which subcultures may deviate. Unfortunately, language is often used (unconsciously) as a weapon, rather than reasonably.</p>
<p>For example, you see people get angry over &#8216;intolerance,&#8217; who themselves are clearly intolerant of many things. You see people get angry over &#8216;rudeness&#8217;, who themselves defend doing what some other consider very rude. Etc.</p>
<p>So you have many people who claim that their position is correct because it is more consistent with a value in some way, even though this value has to be balanced with other values, something which is far from trivial.</p>

I don&#8217;t find much to disagree with in there. But think about what that means in the larger picture. When we a society were in the transition from Negro to African-American were those trying to bring about the tabooing of the former and adoption of the latter fairly attacked with reference to gulags and Orwell? Was freedom of conscience frequently invoked? Did people claim they were being forced to lie by using the term African-American? And today, would you (socially) give a pass to someone using the term Negros if he offered some kind of explanation about how in his internal system of beliefs Negro is the one True referent? </p>
<p>Again, I&#8217;m not saying you are wrong about the empirical question of where we are on a society wide level. You may well be right. But in certain places, like  say Canadian college campuses, there are different prevailing norms. I don&#8217;t think personal aesthetics are a good reason to transgress (possibly local) norms. People are free to disagree and go ahead and transgress those norms, but then they will be subject to social sanctions. And I don&#8217;t think those meting out those social sanctions are doing anything wrong. Without social sanctions we can&#8217;t have norms and all-in-all norms are pretty important.</p>

<blockquote><p>How can it possibly be a ‘lie’, the avoidance of which purportedly justifies rudeness, to use a word in comporting with its descriptivist definition?</p></blockquote>
<p>Why do transgendered people get offended when someone refers to them by the wrong pronoun? It’s not just the word that’s relevant, it’s the meaning that the word use implies. For this hypothetical Catholic, calling this woman “Mrs. Rockefeller” isn’t just an aesthetic issue. It’s an implicit approval of the prevailing secular norms on divorce. I think what you’re trying to do is disentangle politeness from ethics but I don’t think you can. Whatever you think is rude overlaps considerably with your ethical beliefs. We could tell this person that they’re beliefs are wrong so they should shut up, but it doesn’t really make much sense to say that they may or may not be wrong in their ethical beliefs but it doesn’t matter either way with regard to the issue.</p>

<p>I think &#8220;African-American&#8221; is stupid and kind of racist in a way that a referent to skin color isn&#8217;t, and have always preferred &#8220;black&#8221; if I absolutely have to refer to race.</p>
<p>But yes, I give people exactly that pass, if, say, they are a Mexican immigrant, and are just using their native word for &#8220;black&#8221; instead of trying to be offensive.</p>

<p>Once you are aware of the norm and double down, you may not intend to be offensive but you know you are being offensive and don&#8217;t care. That amounts to the same thing.</p>

<p>It is not the same thing.  It&#8217;s essentially neutral.  Neither party has the right to dictate the manner of speech, or the feelings of the other.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&#8217;s a sense in which someone might choose to be nice and stop saying things that others find offensive.  Of course, I could just as easily suggest the problem can be solved by the aggrieved party simply deciding to stop being offended by words that are not intended to cause offense.</p>

<p>I see.</p>
<p>So when middle-class women stood up against the social norms of their time in order to go to work, they were just being offensive?</p>
<p>And likewise for anti-racism advocates?</p>
<p>People ignoring social norms in favor of principles is heroic when they successfully change the social norms, and antisocial when they fail.  But it is impossible to know in advance which category you belong in, or in which category future society will put you, or the people you criticize, in.  Which means you advocate against opposing the prevailing social norms.</p>
<p>Which I will grant is the least risky approach, but which I must remind you would not have resulted in the society you live in, or the norms you currently approve of.</p>
<p>Also, social norms aren&#8217;t.  Everybody follows them because they expect everyone else to follow them, but set up a safe space to violate them, like a card game that is racist and sexist for you, and the norms vanish.  Nobody actually believes in the things, they are just terrified everybody else does, and most people spend their entire lives obsessing over what other people think of them.</p>
<p>And when you realize this, when you realize that the only people who pay attention to the norms other people are violating are those who don&#8217;t care what norms they themselves violate &#8211; being that the people who are worried about violating norms are too worried about violating norms to pay attention to other people &#8211; the whole edifice comes crashing down in a puff of &#8220;Holy shit this is a system run by sociopathic assholes for their own benefit&#8221;.</p>
<p>(Seriously.  Look around at the people enforcing the social norms.)</p>

It seems to me you want to eat your cake and have it too. It rather reminds me of people that think that &#8220;I was engaging in civil disobedience&#8221; ought to be a get out of jail free card. The norm breakers that are successful are heroic exactly because they sacrificed for what they believed in. That they were willing to make those sacrifices was part of what gave force to their arguments.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there&#8217;s nothing at all that&#8217;s inherently noble about breaking norms or disobeying civil authority. The object level is once again absolutely critical here.</p>
<p>Maybe in five years JP will be seen as a heroic leader in the backlash against political correctness. And maybe he&#8217;ll look back and think that the years of sitting through faculty meetings while his colleagues condemned him was all worth it. But I won&#8217;t criticize those colleagues, both because I mostly agree with them on the object level and because I see absolutely nothing wrong with social sanctions as a tool for norm enforcement at the meta level.</p>
<p>In terms of your argument that there aren&#8217;t *really* any social norms, I disagree. First, I don&#8217;t think the kind of peer-pressure mediated edgelord spiral you are describing is as common as you are claiming and second, I reject the idea that the face shown in poker game with your buddies is somehow more authentic than the face shown when alone with a spouse, or at work, or sitting at a family dinner. I don&#8217;t even think &#8220;more authentic&#8221; is an especially useful concept. The guy that tells his buddies he wants to fuck bitches and writes saccharine love letters to his girlfriend is the kind of guy who tells his buddies he wants to fuck bitches and writes saccharine love letters to his girlfriend. One isn&#8217;t the &#8216;true him&#8217; and the other a lie. They are both him.</p>

<p>In case you haven&#8217;t picked this up, I am not arguing for a situational use of social norms as a guide to good behavior.  I am arguing against the use of social norms as a guide to good behavior, period.  I am a leftist; manners and politeness favor the status quo.  That&#8217;s part of our deal.  When did you become The Man? </p>
<p>And I will sum up the reason with some rhetorical questions I will assume the answer to.</p>
<p>Have you ever challenged somebody in-person over the violation of a social norm?</p>
<p>You know that queasy feeling as you consider doing it?  That is your mind yelling at you <i>because you are about to violate a social norm</i>.  It is a social faux pax to bring up somebody else&#8217;s faux pax; it is against social norms to challenge somebody for violating social norms.</p>
<p>Literally the only people who challenge people on social norms are people who violate social norms, because it is a violation of social norms to do so.</p>
<p>Think about that for a moment.  It is rude to call somebody else rude.</p>
<p>But nobody is actually consciously aware of this dynamic; we are all a little relieved when a situation requires violating the rules, and somebody else does so.  The racist guy yelling at the elderly black woman produces a contradiction in social norms &#8211; everybody is expected to speak up, while simultaneously everybody is forbidden from doing so.  &#8220;Nonconfrontational&#8221; in British-descended cultures is part of the social norm.</p>
<p>So yeah, seriously.  Social norms are fucking garbage, because at this point they get decided by whoever ignores them.  Which is why the cosmopolitan, manner-centric circles are all full of sociopathic assholes.</p>
<p>Christ.  I leave Leftism for a little while and come back to discover all the punks are wearing business suits.</p>
<p>ETA: And this is a bit of a metapoint, but gender norms are themselves social norms.  Doubly fuck that shit.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p> Rudeness is an odd way to frame a difference in moral beliefs. You’re saying that they should implicitly endorse a belief they vehemently disagree with for the sake of politeness. I’m too tired to think of an example right now but that kind of thing could be used against your beliefs as well. </p></blockquote>
<p>They should not be required to implicitly endorse any beliefs. To do so is in itself rude. Like, the polite thing to do is not to force a believing Catholic into a position where they must refer to a second wife as &#8220;Mrs. Rockefeller.&#8221; Forcing people to choose between a social transgression and a deeply-held principle is rude. </p>
<p>But, yeah, if you&#8217;re making a point to show that you disapprove of Rockefeller&#8217;s second wife, you&#8217;re being rude. Same if you&#8217;re trying to make a point that a devout Catholic doesn&#8217;t really believe your second wife is actually your wife. Same if you are trying to continually force Jordan Peterson to refer to Caitlyn Jenner as a beautiful brave woman.</p>
<p>Politeness and kindness obviously require making space and accommodations for those with minority beliefs. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the question of context. If you are writing a newspaper column or a blog post explaining why you don&#8217;t think Mrs. Rockefeller is really Mrs. Rockefeller, whatever. If you bring that shit  to my Thanksgiving table, someone is going to sock you in the jaw. Don&#8217;t bring it to my Thanksgiving table, thankyouverymuch.</p>
<blockquote><p>Think about that for a moment. It is rude to call somebody else rude.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, yeah. That&#8217;s why we have passive-aggressiveness and social ostracism. People who are rude are not invited to cool parties and get lots of sarcasm thrown their way.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>You know that queasy feeling as you consider doing it? That is your mind yelling at you because you are about to violate a social norm. It is a social faux pax to bring up somebody else’s faux pax; it is against social norms to challenge somebody for violating social norms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whether it is OK to call out a violation of social norms depends on a status relationship between the objector and the violator.  I don&#8217;t call it a hierarchy because I think it is not strictly hierarchical and probably not even coherent.  In general a woman in her late middle age or older may call out a violation on any adult.  An older man may call out a violation by a younger man, but if the younger man is black the older man must be black also.  No one unrelated may call out a violation by a child (no, not even to the parent).  All sorts of other rules.</p>

<p>So if I&#8217;m willing to suffer social sanctions rather than pretend that Mr. Rockefeller&#8217;s adulterous relationship is a real marriage, that makes me heroic and gives force to my arguments on the indissolubility of marriage? Or does this line of reasoning only apply to beliefs you agree with?</p>

<p>Heroic? No, simply because I disagree with you on the object level, and courageous heroism versus courageous villainy is really a matter of perspective. Brave? Yes, absolutely. But I don&#8217;t see much courage in arguing that there shouldn&#8217;t be any social consequences to begin with.</p>
<p>If you really believe that trans women are just delusional cis men, and you feel so strongly about it that you absolutely refuse to refer to a trans woman by female or even neutral pronouns under any circumstances, and you&#8217;re actually willing to get expelled or fired or socially ostracized for it, rather than just complaining on the internet that it&#8217;s not something that should get you expelled/fired/ostracized&#8230; well, I can respect the courage in that, even if I find your actual views both objectively wrong from an empirical perspective and morally repulsive. (Though I rather cynically suspect that most of the people arguing against me here wouldn&#8217;t actually have that courage in real life, and would only deliberately misgender trans people in social situations where they felt like they could safely get away with it without suffering any negative consequences.)</p>

<p>Notice how you slide from someone choosing not to use the pronoun he considers false to &#8220;deliberately misgender trans people in social situations.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you believe your position, why do you insist on putting the argument in terms of people who are trying to be rude? Why isn&#8217;t it &#8220;would have the courage to refrain from using gendered pronouns when doing so would require them to either misrepresent their own views or offend someone else, even if the use of a gendered pronoun would otherwise be natural in the context of what they are saying&#8221;?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the obvious description of how those of us who reject your position and prefer not to be rude if they can reasonably avoid it behave. It doesn&#8217;t seem to be how you want us to behave.</p>
<p>To apply your approach in the other direction, do you really have the courage to say to someone who has been avoiding the use of gendered pronouns in such a situation &#8220;Say &#8216;her&#8217; when referring to her, damn you&#8211;what are you, a transphobe?&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p>I am arguing against the use of social norms as a guide to good behavior, period. I am a leftist; manners and politeness favor the status quo. That’s part of our deal. When did you become The Man?</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been a leftist in that sense. I&#8217;m neither a radical nor a reactionary. I think things are pretty good (even despite Donald Trump) and are likely to get better in the near and medium term. I have no interest in revolution, and getting rid of all social norms certainly qualifies as that. I&#8217;m happy that rigid gender norms are fading, but as far as I&#8217;m concerned that don&#8217;t need to disappear all at once, yesterday. Slow and steady progress works for me.</p>
<p>The reason I am a &#8220;leftist&#8221; around here is because the post frequency adjusted median poster when it comes to social issues is way way out to the right. Or at least it looks a lot that way because it is natural to categorize people by which outgroups they constantly choose to attack.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Man, skepticism about transgender rights is not a fringe position. </p>
<p><a rel="nofollow"href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/11/08/transgender-issues-divide-republicans-and-democrats/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/11/08/transgender-issues-divide-republicans-and-democrats/</a></p>
<p>The majority of Americans apparently don&#8217;t think transgender is even a thing. That&#8217;s almost true even among Millennials. It&#8217;s actually an issue that my Millennial leftist friends HAVE noticed: they thought they were super-progressive because they supported gay marriage, then the Zennials came in with transgender rights, and they had to reconsider how progressive they really were. </p>
<p>I guess the specific case of bringing it up at a party might be rightist or whatever, but that&#8217;s more a question of &#8220;what do you think is polite social behavior&#8221; rather than ideology, IMO.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@DavidFriedman: If someone was simply using gender-neutral pronouns, or avoiding the use of pronouns altogether, I wouldn&#8217;t confront them about it. I wouldn&#8217;t even have any real problem with it <i>per se</i>, though I would find it highly conspicuous. I would also wonder if it meant they had a problem with trans people in general, and while I wouldn&#8217;t assume bad faith right off the bat, I&#8217;d be a little wary around them, at least initially.</p>
<p>If someone misgendered me or another trans person I knew, I would politely correct them. After that, if they made an effort to use the correct pronouns (or neutral pronouns, or no pronouns), but still slipped up from time to time, I would ignore the periodic slip-ups. If it became too frequent, I would correct them again, still politely but a little more firmly.</p>
<p>If they continued to <i>deliberately and exclusively</i> use the wrong pronouns even after being corrected, I would aggressively confront them about it. If they still continued after that, I would stop associating with them altogether.</p>
<p>If that wasn&#8217;t an option (for instance, if they were a classmate or a student or a co-worker, or a close friend of a close friend), I would make an appeal to our teacher/dean/boss/mutual friend to either force them to change their behavior or stop forcing me to be around them. If the person in question <i>was</i> the teacher/dean/boss, I would appeal to their higher-ups. If that didn&#8217;t work or wasn&#8217;t an option, and I had no other recourse to their harassment, I would strongly consider taking legal action against them.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>When we a society were in the transition from Negro to African-American were those trying to bring about the tabooing of the former and adoption of the latter fairly attacked with reference to gulags and Orwell?</p></blockquote>
<p>This analogy really doesn&#8217;t work very well, because unlike in the misgendering or &#8220;Mrs. Rockefeller&#8221; examples, the two social norms aren&#8217;t at odds with each other.  Someone can be BOTH a &#8220;Negro&#8221; (i.e. a person with dark skin) and an &#8220;African American&#8221; (i.e. an American of African descent) with no contradiction between the two.  Asking someone who used to say &#8220;Negro&#8221; to say &#8220;African American&#8221; instead is not asking this person to lie, or to specifically and publically disavow their belief in the superiority of the previous social norm in order to adopt the new one.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>If someone was simply using gender-neutral pronouns</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, English doesn&#8217;t have a set of gender neutral pronouns. &#8220;It&#8221; is neuter, not gender neutral, and likely to be taken as an insult. There are some circumstances in which I can use &#8220;one&#8221; as a stand-in for a pronoun, but it&#8217;s usually clumsy. A lot of people use &#8220;they&#8221; as a neuter singular, but that offends my ear for reasons having to do with number not gender.</p>
<p>Usually the most practical solution is to use the person&#8217;s name instead of using pronouns.</p>

<p>Yes? Not required by law, obviously. But by social norms? Absolutely. I&#8217;m genuinely surprised you even brought up an example like this, the answer seems blatantly obvious to me. No offense, but that seems like something an alien with no understanding of human social dynamics would ask.</p>
<p>I grew up in a Catholic household and spent 12 years in Catholic school, and I&#8217;ve <i>never</i> met a Catholic who refused to refer to remarried people by their chosen surname. Even the Catholic priests I&#8217;ve known wouldn&#8217;t do that.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The poster below said it would be &#8220;rude, but not a lie,&#8221; which I would agree with. Whereas Friedman&#8217;s position seemed to be &#8220;it&#8217;s not rude <i>because</i> it&#8217;s not a lie,&#8221; or at least &#8220;being rude is justified in this particular case because it&#8217;s not a lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am not debating whether Mrs. Rockefeller&#8217;s marriage and surname are valid from a Catholic point of view. That&#8217;s irrelevant to me, but for the sake of argument, let&#8217;s assume that Friedman is correct and her marriage <i>isn&#8217;t</i> valid. I&#8217;m debating whether it would be socially acceptable for a Catholic to refuse to call her by her chosen surname because of it. Friedman said it would, I said it wouldn&#8217;t, and Anonymous below merely clarified some details about the example itself without taking a strong stance either way.</p>

<p>FWIW, I think it&#8217;s morally unacceptable to say something you don&#8217;t believe true as if it is. It may be permissible to simply avoid the issue to prevent unnecessary hard feelings.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Anonymous just unambiguously disagreed with you, proving my point. You shouldn’t go around accusing people of not understanding social norms just because they ask a question about it. It’s ironic that you’re taking a stand against rudeness, but you do so by being rude to David Friedman, when there was no plausible justification compelling you to be rude.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Catholics do not believe in divorce. </p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s not true. Divorce for Catholics is possible via the <a href="https://infogalactic.com/info/Petrine_privilege" rel="nofollow">Petrine</a> and <a href="https://infogalactic.com/info/Pauline_privilege" rel="nofollow">Pauline</a> privileges. </p>
<p>Divorce is more accurately *forbidden* to Catholics, and absent grounds as the above, the Church cannot dissolve a valid sacramental marriage.</p>
<blockquote><p>Nelson Rockefeller, governor of New York, got divorced and remarried. Is a believing Catholic required to refer to his second wife as “Mrs. Rockefeller” even though he doesn’t believe she is? As his wife?</p></blockquote>
<p>Depends. Is Rockefeller (nominally) Catholic? Was his marriage to his former wife a valid sacramental marriage (not annulled)?</p>
<p>If so, then this woman is his adulterous mistress, and his previous woman is still his wife. It would be rude, but not a lie, to refer to them as such. It would be a lie to refer to the new woman as his wife.</p>
<p>If his marriage was annulled, or was never made sacramental, the previous marriage never existed except as an informal relationship as far as the Catholic Church is concerned.</p>
<p>If he&#8217;s not Catholic, then whatever rules are used by his civil/pagan/heretic denomination apply.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think he was Catholic, so my example was poorly chosen. </p>
<p>But we can ask the same questions in a hypothetical involving someone who was a Catholic and did get a divorce and remarriage.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t think I or another Catholic should ever be required to refer to his second wife as &#8220;Mrs. Rockefeller,&#8221; but Brad is right that most alternatives, to her face, would be extremely rude. But as with the transgender example, I don&#8217;t think calling her that means I&#8217;m actually affirming it&#8217;s a valid marriage—it is, for instance, her <i>legal</i> name. Now, supposing that she heard me call her that, and knew I was Catholic, and asked if I really thought she was married to Mr. Rockefeller, then unless I can avoid the question I&#8217;d have to say that no, I don&#8217;t think so, and I think it would take some grave circumstances to permissibly engage in such question dodging there anyway. If she takes issue with <i>that</i>, too bad for her.</p>
<p>Peterson talks a lot about &#8220;ceding the linguistic territory&#8221; in things like this, but personally, I don&#8217;t see a problem with &#8220;ceding&#8221; this territory, so long as I can make clear that I&#8217;m granting such terms for the sake of conversation or politeness, and they aren&#8217;t reflecting of my beliefs on the matter.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Meta-level tangent related to the pronoun flamewar above.</p>
<p>A lot of people are arguing that under the prevailing social norms it is extremely rude, to the point of constuting harassment, to &#8220;misgender&#8221; someone by not using the pronoun which matches their professed gender identity. But this social norm only prevailed within the last decade as the result of a top-down push by the media and federal government with essentially no public debate. If someone had fallen into a coma in 2008 and woke up today, they would have full knowledge of all of our social norms <i>except this one</i>.</p>
<p>So the question is, who determines the social norms? Is it just whoever has the whip-hand at the moment, so in another ten years we could see an equally sudden reversal on e.g. Ms. versus Miss/Mrs.? Or is there some authority beyond naked force which we can appeal to in our society?</p>

<p>To answer your question, social norms are determined by all of us. There is no whip hand.</p>
<p>While I agree that someone that had gone into a coma in 2008 would be very unlikely to be familiar enough with the norm to instantly &#8220;get it&#8221; if told that someone&#8217;s preferred pronouns are she and her, but I do think someone with a particular set of meta-norms about respect and self identification going into that coma would pretty quickly see what was going on and adopt the new norm without much fuss.</p>
<p>Finally, I don&#8217;t think anyone is claiming that the new norm is universal and it is certainly possible it will grow weaker rather than stronger over the next ten years. That&#8217;s up to all of us. I personally wouldn&#8217;t bet that way.</p>

<p>The OP was, in part, about how college rules against misgendering here are explicitly grounded in Title IX reasoning. I would be very surprised if this push had succeeded with a less cooperative civil service and judiciary.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re familiar with the force, because you like to mock the idea of chilling effects here. Corporate HR departments and college administrations have their ears to the ground trying to anticipate what policies won&#8217;t get them sued. If the government moves one step to the left they take two steps just to be safe. And so  when Joe Schmo gets fired or expelled for saying something politically incorrect people like you can smugly say &#8220;the first amendment only refers to <i>government</i> action. I thought you liked the market?&#8221;</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t something particularly complex or difficult to understand. If the Trump administration was sending Dear Colleague letters out about admitting illegal immigrants I&#8217;m sure that you wouldn&#8217;t have trouble understanding that the threat of lawsuits to deny someone employment or education constitutes force.</p>
<blockquote><p>To answer your question, social norms are determined by all of us. There is no whip hand.</p></blockquote>
<p>That would be much more plausible if opinion polls didn&#8217;t show the public split 50:50, with much of that support coming after the norm was established.</p>
<p>Obviously the plurality of the country &#8220;on the right side of history&#8221; had more of a say than the majority who were on the other side. They command, we obey: sounds like a holding the whip to me.</p>

<p>The OP talks about a bill in <b>Canada</b> and an incident where administrators at a <b>Canadian</b> university interpreted that law. How in the world is a letter sent by the U.S. department of education to US universities regarding its preferred interpretation of a U.S. law as it relates sexual assault disciplinary hearings law relevant whatsoever to a Canadian law and/or an incident involving misgendering at a Canadian university and/or social norms about pronoun usage? And what the heck is &#8220;Title IX reasoning&#8221; even supposed to mean in the first place?</p>
<p>And you thought that this connection not only exists in the first place, but is so obvious that an offhand reference to a top down push by the federal government against misgendering would clearly be understood as referring to the dear colleague letter? How bizarre. Like something out of <i>The Prague Cemetery</i>.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You can go back to the OP, it&#8217;s still there. It explicitly connects the current events in Canada to our troubles with Title IX. </p>
<blockquote><p>Like something out of The Prague Cemetery.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is an incredibly obscure reference. I had to look it up just to get that you&#8217;re comparing me to a fictional conspiracy theorist, which makes it a fairly ineffective insult.</p>
<p>Anyway I probably shouldn&#8217;t have used shorthand. I assumed that since this topic has been done to death everyone is familiar with the events.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>A different tangent from the pronoun discussion &#8230;</p>
<p>In the SCA, people adopt a persona&#8211;an imaginary person from someplace in period history. They tend to dress as that persona, sometimes do other things based on their persona. My SCA persona is a North African Muslim, so at SCA events I don&#8217;t drink alcohol or eat pork. </p>
<p>Some people say they have multiple personas. Very rarely, it&#8217;s true. In most cases, they have no persona, just multiple names and sets of clothing, all being worn by the same (modern) person. The simplest evidence that they do not have multiple personas is that if you know one of them, the other will treat you as someone he already knows. </p>
<p>This feels to me like the same sort of issue. What you are is not determined by what you say you are. If I declare that I am six feet tall, I still can&#8217;t get things off high shelves without standing on something. If you say you are a 10th c. Norseman today and a 15th c. Italian tomorrow but act as the same person both days, you shouldn&#8217;t expect other people to take seriously the idea that they are different.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you decide you are a woman despite being physically male and continuing to act and look in a way that signals male, you are not entitled to demand that other people pretend to see you as female. One shouldn&#8217;t go out of one&#8217;s way to point out the conflict, in either case, but one has no obligation to pretend to what one does not believe.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a common pattern in lots of other contexts. If I try to sing along with &#8220;Happy Birthday,&#8221; observers should probably not make a point of the fact that I can&#8217;t carry a tune, but they have no obligation to pretend that I can.</p>

<p>Well said.  This is basically what I believe as well.  I&#8217;d distinguish between groups:</p>
<p>1.  Those who are passing so well that I don&#8217;t even realize they aren&#8217;t the gender they identify as &#8211; In this case there is no problem, as I&#8217;ll never know anything abnormal is going on</p>
<p>2.  Those who are making a clear effort to pass, but are still in some ways visibly their biological gender &#8211; In this case, they are making an effort, and I am likely to reciprocate by making an effort to think of them and refer to them as their chosen gender</p>
<p>3.  Those who are making little/no effort to pass &#8211; In this case, if they aren&#8217;t making an effort, why should I.  If you <i>look like</i> a dude in a dress and you aren&#8217;t even trying <i>not</i> to look like a dude in a dress, then I&#8217;m going to call you and treat you like a dude in a dress.</p>
<p>This only seems fair.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>If someone had fallen into a coma in 2008 and woke up today, they would have full knowledge of all of our social norms <i>except this one</i>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, I quite possibly would have known, because I happened to know a genderfluid person just before 2008 who introduced me to that norm. Which (among other things) leads me to suspect that there is a different explanation at hand for the sudden reversal: trans people were (and still are, outside of media attention) a very small and fairly invisible minority, and even though this norm was pushed in much of the trans community it wasn&#8217;t more widely known until trans issues were recently pushed into the spotlight. A future prevailing social norm that you and I haven&#8217;t heard of now probably already exists within an even more obscure community who has yet to gain much visibility.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I had that problem for a long time. It just means none of your Facebook friends are on Reciprocity. The UI is terrible in that case. If you have friends there it makes a lot more sense.</p>
<p>I still have only one friend on Reciprocity (even though I have quite a few friends who read SSC). Makes it not very useful to me.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Oh wow, I had no idea. Saints Cyril and Methodius are pretty much the only saints that I can unequivocally respect (granted, there may be lots of saints I just don&#8217;t know about). They were canonized not for getting martyred, or for advancing their version of religious dogma, or for conquering territory; but for essentially uplifting an entire people into full sapience. Few individuals throughout history have that honor.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Well, into full <i>literacy,</i> at least 🙂<br />
But the cool / weird factoid that is not so well known is that the alphabet that they invented is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glagolitic_script" rel="nofollow">cool and complicated</a>, with lots of little loops, but is not used today. When later scholars devised a simpler, largely Greek-based script for the Old Church Slavonic language, they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script#Name" rel="nofollow">named it in honour of Cyril</a>, with the odd effect that he is an actual inventor-of-an-alphabet who is today best &#8216;known&#8217; as the inventor of a particular alphabet he probably didn&#8217;t actually invent.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Also there&#8217;s the common US-English-speaker issue of assuming that a foreign plural is the singular and adding an -s to the end. &#8220;Pierogies&#8221; is fairly common and sometimes simplified further to &#8220;perogies&#8221;, and I&#8217;ve also heard &#8220;gnocchis&#8221;. </p>
<p>I did once see the reverse (in a video game which should have known better)- the writers assumed that the Russian word <i>strelets</i>, referring to a type of early modern infantry soldier, was plural and invented the nonsense singular &#8220;strelet&#8221;.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Traditional Paczki are richer and denser than typical yeast donuts. A good paczek should be heavier, darker, and a bit crisper on the outside than a Berliner. </p>
<p>They tend to have more egg and fat in the dough, plus a bit of grain alcohol that keeps the oil from penetrating quite as deep. The idea was they&#8217;d have a lot of everything you weren&#8217;t supposed to eat during Lent, to use it up. </p>
<p>But that&#8217;s just like my opinion, man &#8211;  this is one of those things where everyone&#8217;s grandma has a slightly different recipe so there&#8217;s no &#8220;right&#8221; answer. They are special donuts, but they are still donuts.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>They are somewhat homeomorphic to jelly doughnuts, but the dough part is as good as the jelly part.</p>
<p>They are a yeasted dough, so not that sweet&#8211;and the jam filling is most commonly prune/plum or rose jam (sometimes it is made with both rose hips and rose petals/rosewater, sometimes just one or the other.)  I brought prune, rose, and apricot from the local Polish hole-in-the-wall bakery.</p>
<p>Imagine a really good jelly doughnut, with relatively little filling.  (I&#8217;d say a pączki the size of a flattened tennis ball has maybe 2 tablespoons of jam.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>On Marginal Revolution Tyler Cowan has made a couple of references to trying to organize knowledge according to place, with one of the benefits being that nearly anyone you come across can teach you something about the places they&#8217;ve been, so that makes for good small talk fodder ( see #5 <a rel="nofollow"href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/01/tyler-cowens-12-rules-life.html" rel="nofollow ugc">http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/01/tyler-cowens-12-rules-life.html</a> and #2 <a rel="nofollow"href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/02/advantages-organizing-knowledge-terms-country-place.html" rel="nofollow ugc">http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/02/advantages-organizing-knowledge-terms-country-place.html</a>)</p>
<p>Personally I find &#8216;So have you seen any interesting movies lately?&#8217; to be a good neutral conversation starter that works across a large cross section of the population (it has a lot of natural follow up questions, you can ask them to describe the movie to you if you&#8217;re not familiar with it, you can segue to topics that seem related to the plot of the movie, of similar movies, or other movies in the general genre, it gives you a fair amount of conversational optionality.</p>
<p>I find small talk hard as well though.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Huh. This breakdown makes me realize it&#8217;s #1 and #2 I find abjectly terrifying, the actual conversation is usually fine.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my smalltalk advice, for what it&#8217;s worth:</p>
<p>-To me, most of the purpose of smalltalk is to find your way to a topic both people find interesting. Seemingly mundane talk about the weather or such can get you there, it&#8217;s a game where each question or answer has some chance of giving you a clue about something you have in common or something that would be fun to discuss in more detail. Some kinds of questions have a higher information return than others but generally if you can keep it moving and express interest, you can often make your way there.</p>
<p>-Sometimes I can&#8217;t tell if someone who&#8217;s not picking up conversational openings really doesn&#8217;t want to talk to me and is trying to end the conversation, or if they are just &#8220;bad at smalltalk.&#8221; If I had a way of knowing they did want to talk to me but were just having a hard time with conversation flow, I wouldn&#8217;t mind working a bit harder at keeping it going. So expressing enthusiasm/interest even if you don&#8217;t know what to say next is helpful.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>FORM. Family Occupation Recreation Motivation. Follow up the FOR questions with an M question, because those are open-ended and can get people to ramble on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is your family from?&#8221; &#8220;Oh, why did you want to move here/there?&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>if we&#8217;re really doing smalltalk for Absolute Beginners, then some more good stock lines are:</p>
<p>&#8220;So, how do you know [mutual friend]?&#8221; or &#8220;So, who do you know here?&#8221; (then ramble about their connection, or mention how you know them, and ramble about that)<br />
&#8220;What part of [city] do you live in?&#8221; (then ramble about that area, what&#8217;s good about it, what&#8217;s bad about it, how it compares to other areas)<br />
&#8220;What do you do?&#8221; (then&#8211;you guessed it&#8211;ramble on that topic for a bit)</p>
<p>(edit: beaten by Aapje on some of these)</p>
<p>Spending most of the conversation asking questions is kinda like easy mode: it probably won&#8217;t make you seem unusually interesting or charming, but it probably won&#8217;t bore people or (worse) make them think you&#8217;re a boor, either. (Easy mode isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad thing if that&#8217;s what your socials skills levels are at.)</p>
<p>Some people use &#8216;deep&#8217; questions to bypass smalltalk and try to jump straight to forging a deep connection. (A few weeks ago someone I just met asked me what I&#8217;m most afraid of, for instance.) Some people can pull this sort of thing off but I wouldn&#8217;t suggest it to someone who&#8217;s socially unsure of themselves.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@DunnoWhatToDo</p>
<p>The easy part is that, unlike with long term acquaintances, you have lots to discover about each other.</p>
<p>The hard part that you and they may not like what they discover and so information management (what to divulge and what to ask) is not so easy.</p>
<p>So my first advice is to analyze the &#8216;opposition.&#8217; Your first clue is that these people like your friend, which suggests that they are in some way like him. So topics that you like to talk about with your friend may be productive. However, keep in mind that other people may not like your friend for why you like your friend &amp; they may interact with him differently than you.</p>
<p>So what you can do is analyze your friend (both his traits that you like and don&#8217;t you don&#8217;t particularly like). Then at the party you can try to categorize people, based on this information. Then you may be able to determine topics that are likely to be productive (for example, based on physique and/or dress, you may be able to identify the people who do sports with your friend). The optimal outcome is to find a topic that is mutually interesting, but if you want to sacrifice your personal enjoyment to make yourself be liked, you can find a topic that only the other person likes. This can be a very good strategy for people who have trouble with social contact. Many people are very willing to talk your ears off about their favorite topic with minimal prodding.</p>
<p>A bit of research into interesting tidbits about topics that your analysis indicates would find an audience, can enable you to (re)start conversations by means of anecdote (&#8216;Have you heard about&#8230;&#8217;).</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>A simpler strategy that is generically useful, even no prior analysis/information, is to ask about &#8216;default&#8217; topics, like:<br />
&#8211; What do you do?<br />
&#8211; What are your hobbies?<br />
&#8211; Where do you know my friend from?<br />
&#8211; Were you born here? (may not be an appropriate question for some crowds)</p>
<p>Of course, the trick is then to &#8216;riff&#8217; off the responses, which is non-trivial.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think this is pretty good advice. With regard to &#8216;riffing&#8217; off the responses, a strategy I find effective is to concentrate on asking things, and not worrying about whether or not I&#8217;m saying much. Most people like talking about themselves. Of course, thinking of questions is still non-trivial.</p>
<p>A little bit of nodding/smiling/&#8221;oh yeah?&#8221;/laughing/&#8221;sure&#8221;/etc. depending on the tone of what they&#8217;re talking about goes a long way in keeping them talking.</p>
<p>And if you can, try to actually be interested in them/what they&#8217;re talking about! That way you don&#8217;t have to act. 😛</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it is good advice, but executing correctly on it is still difficult (unless you&#8217;ve been blessed with extraversion from birth).

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Second this. I visited a family member for a holiday they were spending with a friend&#8217;s family. They introduced me to the one other person at the gathering that was into geeky topics.<br />
Otherwise, I spent a good amount of time petting the family dog and shamelessly using that as my conversation springboard for anyone who came by. Since it was a potluck situation, praising the food/cooks was also a good springboard.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My trick to smalltalk is piggybacking. I let the extroverts of the group start the conversations. Then, I lurk and eavesdrop on the various groups until I find one that I can contribute to, and then just jump in with said contribution. Usually people won&#8217;t side-eye the jumping in, unless it&#8217;s a very personal-gossip topic, in which case I probably won&#8217;t have anything to contribute, anyways. Often I can get knee-deep into discussion this way, without ever learning anyone&#8217;s names or introducing myself. </p>
<p>Given that your party is this weekend, the Olympics will be topical and interesting from any variety of talking angles. Ask if they&#8217;re following the games, and if so which sport, and then voila. If they&#8217;re not following the games, then you can ask what they&#8217;re following in lieu of the games, and then voila.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>A thought exercise I&#8217;ve been posting to libertarian groups lately: You live in an alternate reality where, instead of Republicans and Democrats, the American political landscape was divided between the two political parties described below. Both of these parties combine some elements of modern conservatism and modern liberalism, but not in a particularly libertarian way, and they&#8217;re very anti-libertarian in some regards. Assuming that you *have* to support one of them (voting is legally required in this world, and third parties don&#8217;t exist), which would you choose?</p>
<p>Populist Party: Combines Trump-style right-populism with Bernie-style left-populism. Protectionist (supports high tariffs and subsidies for American companies that employ American workers), isolationist (anti-war, wants to pull out of foreign conflicts and greatly defund the military, wants to pull out of trade organizations and agreements like NAFTA and the TPP), anti-immigration (wants to deport all illegal immigrants and make it harder for them to get in, and greatly reduce legal immigration, especially from &#8216;dangerous&#8217; countries), pro-welfare but only for &#8220;real Americans&#8221; (supports universal healthcare and guaranteed basic income, but only for natural-born American citizens), strongly favors a states&#8217; rights approach to social issues (e.g. abortion, LGBT issues, drug policies), supports some restrictions on free speech to prevent the spread of &#8220;anti-American&#8221; sentiments (e.g. criminalizing flag burning, regulating mass media that challenges traditional American/Christian values, monitoring people who support Marxist or Islamist ideologies).</p>
<p>Globalist Party: Combines Republican-style neoconservatism with Democrat-style neoliberalism. Favors free trade (low tariffs, no tax penalties for companies that outsource work to other countries, heavy involvement in trade organizations/agreements like NAFTA and the TPP), supports heavy military spending, encourages frequent military interventionism for the sake of &#8220;promoting democracy&#8221; and securing American interests, pro-immigration (wants to make it easier for people to immigrate here legally and for illegal immigrants to become citizens), wants to cut funding to social safety net programs (e.g. welfare, social security, public healthcare), very socially liberal on women&#8217;s issues and LGBT Issues (pro-choice, supports gay marriage, etc.) but vehemently opposed to drug legalization, supports some restrictions on free speech and free association to prevent discrimination against marginalized groups (e.g. outlawing hate speech, preventing businesses from refusing to serve/hire people based on race or religion or sexual orientation).</p>

<p>Libertarians are widely seen as being &#8220;fiscally conservative and socially liberal,&#8221; and the Populist Party is meant to be the inverse of that. It&#8217;s also something that I&#8217;m honestly a little surprised doesn&#8217;t exist already, given how socially conservative people tend to be poor and would seemingly benefit from more left-wing economic policies, at least in the short term. We may be seeing the beginnings of such a movement now, given that a lot of modern conservatives seem to be moving toward the center on economic issues while simultaneously moving further right on social issues.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Libertarians are widely seen as being “fiscally conservative and socially liberal,” and the Populist Party is meant to be the inverse of that. </p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t see the fiscal conservatism in either of your parties.  One of them wants to spend lots of money on welfare and subsidies, one of them wants to spend lots of money on foreign wars, neither of them wants to raise income or other revenue-generating taxes.  Can you guess what happens when these two parties sit across the table and negotiate a budget they can both agree to?</p>
<p>Hint: You&#8217;ve seen it in action recently.  Also,</p>
<blockquote><p>Assuming that you *have* to support one of them (voting is legally required in this world, and third parties don’t exist), which would you choose?</p></blockquote>
<p>The ruling party of the country most likely to fire thermonuclear missiles at the capital of the one you posit?</p>
<p>OK, that&#8217;s a bit harsh, particularly given that you&#8217;ve pretty much guaranteed the country will destroy itself in the long run.  But mandatory voting is an abomination that ought to be seen only in communist hellholes; AFIK the only  respectable nation that actually enforces such a mandate is Australia, and they at least let you turn in a spoiled ballot if you&#8217;re not satisfied with any of their dozen formally represented political parties.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p> chaffing at Clinton’s interventionism in the Balkans.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why?  </p>
<p>Bosnia, and Kosovo seem to be the best possible outcomes for US intervention. We stopped a pretty odious regime from slaughtering a lot of people, and headed off what was likely to turn into a very serious Jihadist insurgency. All in all, an easy  nearly zero cost win for the good guys.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d wager that insurgency would have been crushed into something of minor and local significance if NATO had stayed out of it, left the Serbs and their Russian allies to deal with it.</p>
<p>As you say, we did a great deal of local good at low cost on that occasion.  But we also set the precedent that Europe can effectively decide to start wars that the US has to fight.  That didn&#8217;t work nearly so well in e.g. Libya, and I&#8217;m not sure we&#8217;re done with it yet.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The first party, if I think it really won&#8217;t engage in scads of foreign wars or initiate arms races. On almost every other topic you listed, I find the second party&#8217;s position better or at least only equally bad. But the military issues are that important.</p>
<p>In practice, I <i>might</i> end up changing my mind about how bad foreign interventions  are if after observing a U.S. that stayed disengaged for ~15-20 years it turned out world order obviously collapsed and clearly wouldn&#8217;t have if the U.S. kept engaging in wars. But I find that pretty implausible. And even then I&#8217;m not sure. I&#8217;m not a utilitarian.</p>
<p>Also in practice, I don&#8217;t expect to see a serious militarily isolationist party in power in the U.S. during the next 20 years probably much longer.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>For those saying anti-war:  Is this because of the benefit to those in other lands, or the benefit to the US people?</p>
<p>I was considering the pro-immigration one as more likely to have reciprocal treaties making it easy for me to emigrate to a better country, and contrasting this to the anti-way party as better for others and maybe I should take the hit to the personal freedoms I care most about out of duty to the greater good.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Both/I don&#8217;t really see how you separate them?</p>
<p>I spent time in Berlin during the Bush administration, and being in college at the time, I expected all the tips about travelling to Europe to be true, having to pretend you are a Canadian, all the scorn, barely acknowledged by service workers who think you are a fat hamburger, etc.</p>
<p>What I found when I got there, even as I was hanging out with far left art studio kids? They hated Bush, but had a far less cynical view of Americans than I did. John F Kennedy might as well have given the &#8220;Ich bin ein Berliner&#8221; speech the year before for how much they genuinely believed America was a force for good, with good people, who sometimes ended up with idiots in charge.</p>
<p>American hard power sometimes works for us, but frequently blows up in our face. American diplomacy/persuasion/culture is a 10x better weapon at making people like us and want to be like us, and benefit our status. I am flabbergasted every time I think about how it took America 10 years to go from &#8220;Wow, we brought down the Iron Curtain with soft power and finally achieved the impossible&#8221; to &#8220;actors in international relations respond to only two things: economic incentives and force&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>How do these parties feel about suicide?  Because with those choices, I think it&#8217;s an option I would want to keep open.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re both terrible on free speech, obviously.  Which is worse depends on implementation details; both &#8220;hate speech&#8221; and &#8220;challenges traditional American/Christian values&#8221; can be blank checks.</p>
<p>The Populists win on social issues, mostly because of drug legalization (though the culture war shows us that being liberal on women&#8217;s issues and LGBT issues can be very anti-liberty also).</p>
<p>The Globalists are a clear win on economic issues, except for the military spending.</p>
<p>For the military, I think the Populist stance is probably not tenable.  The US still has enemies.  The Globalists are far too hawkish, but better to have an empire than to be weak.  </p>
<p>So I&#8217;d go for the Globalists.  Especially if they&#8217;ll let me keep my .45 just in case.  With the caveat that I&#8217;m not sure either party has a consistent position as you&#8217;ve described it.  For instance, in the real world, public healthcare is often claimed to be part of &#8220;women&#8217;s issues&#8221;.</p>

<p>I honestly don&#8217;t know which of these I&#8217;d pick. How big is the Globalist war machine? How actually-effective is the Populist federalism? The other guy said you&#8217;d need more context. I agree with that.</p>
<p>Absent context, I&#8217;ll take a position of always voting against the incumbents (if that&#8217;s allowed).</p>

<p>Seconded. 😀</p>
<p>I think between the two of them I could stomach voting for the Populist party, though. Especially if the states&#8217; rights were given a fair amount of latitude, or if there were principled populists who don&#8217;t care much for banning &#8220;anti-American&#8221; speech.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m not a libertarian anymore, but my answer from when I was would be the same as it is now, the Populists, easily. Imperialism is the #1 problem with the United States, and one that doesn&#8217;t respond to the populace&#8217;s desires to curtail it, and it has been that way since Eisenhower. All the things about free speech and liberal social rights I don&#8217;t like I&#8217;m fairly certain would be addressed over time by protests and voting, or in the worst case, just waiting for the older generation to die, but military adventures and military Keynesianism are the lodestone around our neck dragging us down that We the People seem to have no power to dispute whether Republicans or Democrats are in charge. Even Bernie Sanders, who is played up as an impossibly idealistic leftie, supported Kosovo and Afghanistan and said he would use drone strikes in our war on terror if elected</p>

<p>That only makes sense on the assumption that the parts of Ireland that were not under effective English rule&#8211;which at the time was most of them&#8211;were uncivilized. I wouldn&#8217;t expect modern Irish to share that assumption.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Because language is weird. Why do English people refer to the back of the car as the &#8220;boot&#8221; while Americans say &#8220;trunk&#8221;?</p>
<p>And apparently in <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/beyond_the_pale" rel="nofollow">beyond the pale</a> &#8220;the Pale&#8221; refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale" rel="nofollow">a specific place in Ireland</a>? So history and politics could play into it&#8230; although it&#8217;s also possible that the idiom is sufficiently it&#8217;s own thing that&#8217;s its been adopted in Ireland on its own.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Americans say &#8220;trunk&#8221; because early cars had a literal luggage trunk bolted to the back of the vehicle or placed on a specially designed shelf.  &#8220;Boot&#8221; was originally used to describe outside areas on horse-drawn coaches where people (usually attendants) could ride, and which eventually developed into storage spaces, but I don&#8217;t know how that word came about.  (Google suggests that coachmen rode on a &#8220;boot locker&#8221; containing literal boots, but that smells a little too pat to me.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Heh, my question was rhetorical, but thank you for finding out and explaining! I actually was a bit curious, but not enough to look it up myself 😛</p>
<p>The rhetorical point was that etymology can be good at explaining the &#8220;how&#8221; of language change but often not the &#8220;why&#8221; &#8212; but that&#8217;s kindof beside the point b/c it seems anonymousskimmer actually had a hypothetical &#8220;why&#8221; and was working from that.</p>
<p>@Lilian &#8212; I&#8217;d forgotten about the bonnet! Are there any other car-parts that get named after clothing in a corresponding way? (So not like the literal belt that&#8217;s part of the drive system.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>In American English at least, &#8220;Beyond the Pale&#8221; means (archaic) the part of Ireland not ruled by the English, and (colloquial) that which is so unseemly and improper as to not be spoken of in polite society.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways that this apparent equivalence could be interpreted, or misinterpreted, from the perspective of the Republic of Ireland.</p>

<blockquote><p>As for the relationship between the two expressions, the OED has this to say:</p>
<p>“The theory that the origin of the phrase [‘beyond the pale’] relates to any of several specific regions, such as the area of Ireland formerly called the Pale … or the Pale of Settlement in Russia … is not supported by the early historical evidence and is likely to be a later rationalization.”</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;d assume that later rationalizations still have an impact on contemporary word usage, especially if that later rationalization is the cause of the popularizing of a particular word or phrase invented earlier.</p>

I&#8217;m curious if people agree with either of the halves of the article. The second one may be more interesting to this community given the nature of the claims made. I did speak to a relevant policy expert on Twitter regarding the federal jobs aspect but he had little comment on the secondary effects regarding culture, social cohesion, and high trust societies.</p>

<p>This got me thinking about the relationship between wealth levels and infidelity in the US. Is there a correlation? I would guess that generally wealthier people have less infidelity, but intuitively I think there could also be a barbell distribution. Any insights?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If true, I&#8217;d be inclined to say that wealthy men have always been able to support several families, the social cost to a man having multiple partners/casual partners/children outside of wedlock has generally been much less than for women, and &#8216;romantic marriage for love alone&#8217; is a very recent invention.  Marriage was about making family alliances, inheritance, crossing another step on the journey of adulthood, keeping the family name going by having descendants, and settling down to be a citizen with a stake in society; mistresses were for fun and status; casual sex was available for those who could pay for it.</p>
<p>Chinese society may retain more echoes of cultural mores of the days when well-off men could have several wives and children by them, and romance was a pastime but nothing to do with making a good and proper marriage, so being socially open about having side families is not seen as undesirable.  All of which is to say I don&#8217;t think there is a striking difference in the basic drives between &#8220;would wealthy people in the US be more/less/the same level of infidelity?&#8221; except that perhaps more discretion is expected and visibly cheating on your spouse would be expected to generate outrage and repercussions.  Though nowadays mostly repercussions are of the &#8220;get divorced, while waiting to divorce say your mistress is your <i>fiancée</i> and then marry her once it goes through&#8221; <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/edward-falzon/in-defense-of-dinesh-dsouza_b_1889110.html" rel="nofollow">kind</a> than the ostracism of days gone by.</p>
<p>Cons: a wealthy man having an affair that is discovered by his wife is risking losing a good chunk of his wealth in a divorce settlement</p>
<p>Pros: that&#8217;s what pre-nuptial agreements are for, so she can&#8217;t get a chunk of your assets if the marriage ends</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>For what it may be worth, that is consistent with what I have seen, i.e. I knew two successful Chinese men who fairly openly had multiple wives.  I haven&#8217;t known anyone else like this, but presumably the practice is pretty common in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am pretty confident that for men in the US, extra-marital relations increase with rising wealth/income.  On the theory that having money makes a man more attractive to women and that in general, men are about as faithful as their options allow.</p>
<p>For women, I think it&#8217;s a good deal more complicated since women have two-track sexuality and are also very sensitive to social pressure compared to men.  But if I had to guess, I would guess that wealthy women are less likely to have extramarital relationships since it&#8217;s more likely that their husbands are their best romantic option and also they are afraid of the social stigma that might result in their nice neighborhood if word got out.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It seems like the more common pattern (at least the visible one) in US the upper-middle class[1] is serial monogamy&#8211;the wealthy guy divorces his old wife and gets a younger, prettier one, and maybe iterates this process a few times.  But I have no idea how common it is for married men to keep a long-term mistress.  </p>
<p>[1] I don&#8217;t really know what the society of the very rich in the US looks like in this regard, since I don&#8217;t really spend much time in such circles.</p>

<p>N=1 observation, but when I was in Egypt my driver was extremely open with me about the fact he had a wife and a woman on the side. I think he was bragging, essentially &#8220;I&#8217;m well enough off I can keep two women.&#8221; Don&#8217;t know how common this was, though.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If I were to stereotype my network (which, do to a life that&#8217;s spanned several classes/wealth brackets, cuts a wide swath)&#8230; fidelity goes up with a college degree or a low-status/wealth-boost graduate degree (such as an masters in forestry or a not-so-lucrative engineering degree) but then goes down with a high-status/wealth-boost degree like a high-powered mba or law degree.</p>
<p>Or, yeah, it&#8217;s a barbell. To the point that 2 of 2 of the ministers I know (both with a high amount of experience with middle and upper-middle class segments, and nearly no experience with labor class, underclass, or elites) have *very* strong negative feelings about lawyers and doctors and mbas&#8211;they just take it as a given that those people have to work harder to make their marriages work. </p>
<p>YMMV. Seems like causality is obviously very muddled here&#8211;high-risk-taking people will somewhat over-represent in high pay-off professions, and for anyone you already know, the fact that *you* know them is at least potentially much more important than the fact of their particular career/income/etc.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a two-child policy since 2016, too. And rural vs. urban regions have different rules. Previously, you could get an exception to one-child if your first was a daughter. And non-Chinese officially recognized minorities have additional children limits, due to affirmative action.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I posted this late in the last open thread and a few people recommended reposting it early in the next one, so here it is again. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>I’ve been posting here occasionally, talking about my journey to try and fix my lack of emotions. I recently had a very interesting and bizarre experience involving a weed edible giving me feelings back for a short time, and I was looking for some commentary on it from some of the smart people here, because I really don’t know what to make of it. <a rel="nofollow"href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/12/31/ot92-ocean-thread/#comment-583082">Here’s my last comment, for reference &amp; symptoms.<br />
</a><br />
So a while back I received an edible from a friend. It was a miniature cupcake containing ~50mg of THC. On a whim I decided to take half of it, let’s say 25-35mg. (</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that I’ve already tried weed, usually edibles, and took everything from 10 to 60mg. Once I even accidentally took roughly 85, which ended up causing a sort of catatonic state, spiraling thought patterns and vomiting for several hours. Not fun)</p>
<p>After taking this relatively low dose, I started to get the ordinary “tiredness and inability to concentrate” thing that normally happens when I take a certain amount of weed, and also the strange uncomfortable feeling/emotion in my chest that I’ve experienced before with shrooms and weed. I got into bed, and the uncomfortable feeling started getting worse and worse. I wouldn’t say it was painful necessarily, but it was more intense than it usually is.</p>
<p>After a while of this, something really odd happened. The uncomfortable feeling gave way to a completely new sensation when I breathed. I don’t normally feel much of anything when I breathe other than the natural refreshment that comes from getting air. But here I could almost feel the breaths cascading through my lungs, filling them and feeling like I could breathe more deeply than ever before. It felt totally different, very hard to describe. It was several times more refreshing than breathing normally is.</p>
<p>Soon after that, I began to feel emotions that I haven’t felt since I was a kid. Things I haven’t really felt since before I became numb. It literally felt like circuitry in my brain that hadn’t been used in decades had suddenly activated.</p>
<p>Imagine food tasting like nothing but styrofoam for years, and then you buy a hamburger and for some reason it’s the first delicious, real food you’ve had in so long. That’s what it was like. I was buffeted with emotions which I’ve felt maybe 3 times in the past decade. It was overwhelming but entirely positive. I was sobbing tears of joy, alone in my bed.</p>
<p>Eventually the edible began to wear off, and though the majority of the emotional experience began to wear off, I was still feeling things! For the next 24 hours or so, I experienced emotions the way I imagine normal people do: As these flitting things that bubble up and coalesce around you during your day-to-day. Somebody would say something to me and it might stir these little ambiguous feelings, whereas before I would have felt nothing. I even lost a minor debate with my mom, because emotions caught me off guard and threw off my rhetoric!</p>
<p>Another strange thing to note is that, during and for few days after the trip, I caught myself not breathing. I don’t think it was anything dangerous, but it’s perplexing. It may have just been due to how much more refreshing breathing was for a while, but I’m not sure. It was kind of like my unconscious breathing process was being interrupted, but I had no issues with sleep regardless.</p>
<p>After about a day, everything had pretty much worn off, and I was more or less back to normal. But I’m left kind of lost about what to do with this information. I could understand if it were shrooms which caused it, but weed? I don’t think it’s the kind of thing I could necessarily use as a long-term treatment, but it’s a clue. What about weed could cause something as strange as this to happen? Something to do with cannabinoid receptors? I’ve never heard of weed having much effect on emotional experience, but I need to research more. I just don’t know enough about psychopharmacology to be able to draw any reasonable conclusions on my own.</p>
<p>All this has done for sure is reaffirm my suspicion that there’s something wrong with my brain, but I don’t know how to proceed. I tried to talk to my psychiatrist about this particular event, but he basically refused to discuss it with me because it’s weed. It’s understandable but deeply frustrating, because I feel like I have few other places to turn. I tried to get in contact with the company that made the edible but they never responded. I’ve spoken to my doctor about my emotional symptoms but he didn’t have much to offer me in the way of assistance. So what’s next? A neurologist?</p>
<p><b>TL;DR:</b> I took a weed edible, it made breathing feel totally different and cured my emotional numbness for a while, and I have no idea what to do with that information.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You might consider trying CBD. It seems unlikely to work, but it&#8217;s completely legal&#8211;you can just order it online&#8211;and generally non-impairing, so it&#8217;d be a pretty feasible long-term treatment.</p>
<p>(If you don&#8217;t know what CBD is, see <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/science-tech/what-does-cbd-do" rel="nofollow">here</a> for an overview and a rosy view of its possible benefits. I wouldn&#8217;t bet too hard on these, but as a low-risk option it&#8217;s worth a shot)</p>
<p>If trying a different psychiatrist is an option, that might help&#8211;my impression is that many would be willing to discuss this.</p>
<p>Otherwise&#8211;I don&#8217;t want to push this on you too hard, there are lots of valid reasons you might not want to, but I do know multiple generally-law-abiding functional people who regularly use weed for mental health issues, taking enough to help their issues but not enough to be visibly high all the time.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>CBD oil is a good idea, I haven&#8217;t given that a try. And weed is legal here in California now, but I&#8217;m not sure if I like the idea of regularly taking a somewhat expensive drug that I don&#8217;t even like. If it works it works, but I&#8217;ve never hand that kind of experience before, and it didn&#8217;t last very long. I&#8217;ll have to experiment with it more.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>1) Get a better psychiatrist. One who is unwilling to discuss your full experience is one who cannot help you process your full experience. Organizations like NORML may have resources to connect with more suitable professionals.</p>
<p>2) Marijuana is known to occasionally have hallucinogenic effects. This is not atypical, though it is rarer.</p>
<p>3) There are definitely case studies of psychedelics being used in psychiatric treatment. MDMA started life that way, if I remember correctly.</p>
<p>Keep at the breathing, by the way. It&#8217;s good for you, and 100% legal in all American states.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I am not a professional. But here&#8217;s what I think is going on with you: there are some mental structures inside of you, deep beliefs about yourself / your place in the world / other people / etc., which make feeling emotions unacceptable. When you took the weed, these mental structures got jumbled out of place, and so emotions were acceptable again, for a little while.</p>
<p>For an example of the kind of way these structures can work: someone might believe that anger is extremely dangerous, because angry people unpredictably destroy things and hurt others. This belief probably arose from early experiences with other people&#8217;s anger. The person holding this belief, if they also believed it was very bad to hurt other people, would then conclude that it was dangerous and bad for <i>themselves </i>to feel anger, and so would suppress any anger they felt. And this all happens at a very low level, so, just naively introspecting, this person would simply see themselves as mysterious unable to feel anger.</p>
<p>A couple other patterns that work like this: &#8220;I am inherently bad” → unacceptable to feel joy; “I can’t let anyone know that things are bad” → unacceptable to feel sadness.</p>
<p>These kinds of deep beliefs may not stand up to rational, outside-view criticism, but my understanding is that such criticism is not sufficient to change them: you have to go inside and meet them on their own terms to effect change. Doing this is tricky but absolutely possible.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve already discovered some of the emotion-body connection. It&#8217;s possible to use this connection to work with emotions, their blockages, and the underlying beliefs around them via the body. I think the most powerful tool for this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focusing" rel="nofollow">Focusing</a>, a psychotherapeutic technique that involves sensitively attending to emotional responses manifested in the body as you probe your issues. You can read the <a href="http://www.focusing.org/focusingbook.html" rel="nofollow">book</a> and just try it yourself, or find a therapist to help. Many other kinds of therapy, too, will be helpful in getting at the cause of emotional blockages.</p>
<p>Also, often people who practice flexibility or relaxation, say with yoga or some kinds of meditation, find that this opens up emotions locked up in parts of the body that had been stiff and numb. Tai Qi did a similar thing for me (but you need a good teacher, who talks about the flow of qi). So you might try something like that and see what it does for you.</p>
<p>Good luck! What I’m talking about entails a long journey, but it’s really worth it. Feel free to ask follow-up questions.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>While I appreciate the comment, I don&#8217;t have a lot of respect for these kinds of theory of mind. They treat the mind as some kind of semi-mystical black box, instead of making falsifiable predictions about an ordered &#8211; if extremely complex &#8211; system. </p>
<p>On a more personal level, I&#8217;m already very introspective and in tune with my wants and needs. I attended therapy for about a year but encountered little in the way of genuine revelations about myself, because most of amounted to just telling my therapist how my mind works. I find it hard to believe that there&#8217;s some sort of deep, inaccessible emotional mechanisms that are holding me back. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that *nothing* has jumbled my mental structures like the time I took 3.5g of magic mushrooms, and I didn&#8217;t have anything resembling an emotional epiphany, despite the scenarios being pretty much identical. I mostly just did &amp; thought insane shit and got stuck in thought loops for a while.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Fair enough. I can&#8217;t really convey all the personal evidence I have which makes me believe these kinds of theories. And I don&#8217;t have explanations for why drugs would sometimes change things and sometimes not.</p>
<p>But I stand by my recommendation, if you&#8217;re interested and have space in your life, to try some kind of practice that involves paying a lot of attention to your body. Bodies are interesting! And you may find unexpected feelings in there.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Just read your last thread, chalk me up as another person finding it to echo my own experience to a degree that is almost eerie.</p>
<p>I don’t have what could probably be considered any super useful advice, but I am someone with what sounds a lot like similar symptoms, and also someone who, ah, let’s say <i>thoroughly explored</i> the effects of weed for several years.</p>
<p>I never experienced any significant change in the emotional situation as a result. On the plus side, like you, my sense of humor/enjoyment seems fine, and it certainly helped with that. But in my case at least, it always stopped there, at the normal things you expect from weed (ie, being cool with sitting on the couch all day and considering Sealab 2021 the greatest comedy achievement of the decade.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If nothing else, I&#8217;m glad to know that I&#8217;m not alone in this. We&#8217;ll all fix ourselves someday. If I ever happen upon a solution, you can bet I will post it in an open thread, and I&#8217;ll try to track down anybody who&#8217;s mentioned experiencing the same thing.</p>
<p>Thanks for chiming in with your experiences regarding weed, it helps fill in the gaps, large as they are. Maybe this is something unique to me, or to that particular event. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried researching weed and its effects on emotions several times, but I can&#8217;t find much in the way of legitimate inquiry. Probably because scientists can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t run causal studies on a drug that&#8217;s <b>schedule goddamn 1</b> for some reason. The damage the War on Drugs has done to the field of psychopharmacology is immense. We&#8217;re only just now starting to explore areas which should&#8217;ve been explored decades ago.</p>
<p>The only article I found that was even slightly relevant was one that examined a cannabinoid&#8217;s influence on the salience of fear stimuli and hippocampal response. I think it&#8217;s time for Cannabis: Much More Than You Wanted To Know</p>
<p>Edit: Turns out that Marijuana: MMTYWTK <a rel="nofollow"href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/01/05/marijuana-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/">was actually the first in the entire series</a>. That&#8217;s useful.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>So, on the predictions thread, I <a rel="nofollow"href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/02/06/predictions-for-2018/#comment-599132">described</a> why I might potentially find reciprocity.io useful, if only more people were on it.  Today I realized why despite such reasons it is seriously unlikely to remain useful to me in the near future.  Now in that comment I assumed (as Scott basically does above) that it&#8217;s useful only as a dating site; while that&#8217;s not necessarily true and I can indeed potentially see the other boxes having potential uses too, those cases are substantially less likely to come up so as Scott does I&#8217;m going to below just go with the dating-site assumption.</p>
<p>So, Scott&#8217;s statement above that</p>
<blockquote><p>It does require your Facebook friends also use the site, but if you’re socially exposed to the rationalist community many of them will.</p></blockquote>
<p>made me curious; just how many Facebook friends from the LW-sphere do I have, anyway? What I found was:<br />
1. In fact the number is small, and<br />
2. Applying the assumption above, we can exclude most of those from &#8220;people who would constitute a reason to use reciprocity.io&#8221; for reasons of sex/gender, and<br />
3. Of those people not excluded in 2, <i>all of them are already on the site.</i>  (And, as you might infer, are not people who fall under any of the cases that would actually make it useful &#8212; which, remember, requires that there be some reason that some amount of indirection be required rather than me being willing to just ask normally).</p>
<p>In short, <i>no</i> amount of promotion of this site within the LW-sphere will make it useful to me!  In order for it to be useful, something like one of the following would have to be true:<br />
1. It would have to become known and used outside of the LW-sphere;<br />
2. I&#8217;d have to move to the Bay Area or something (except that probably wouldn&#8217;t actually produce many cases where it would be useful because once again why not just ask directly?);<br />
3. We&#8217;d have to get a bunch more people at meetups here in Ann Arbor (which aren&#8217;t actually going at the moment but no I don&#8217;t think I can host one sorry :-/ );<br />
4. I&#8217;d have to be substantially more inclusive with who I add as a friend on Facebook&#8230; or add people specifically for the use of the site, which, uh, I don&#8217;t really think so&#8230; even if we ignore the awkwardness of such a thing, I&#8217;m not entirely sure there&#8217;s a scenario where that makes sense (I mean I can imagine one but I wouldn&#8217;t expect it to come up).<br />
5. Something else?</p>
<p>So, uh, yeah. :-/  I stand by what I said about the main problem being not enough people (well, to the extent that the problem isn&#8217;t the fundamental workings of the site, like it being tied to Facebook and the restrictions that brings with it), but, contrary to what Scott suggests above, just promoting it within the LW-sphere is not going to solve that problem in a useful way, at least not for me.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think the marketing and/or the internal culture of that site is really working against it. I&#8217;m not even sure who the site is for. Is it for everyone, even the dreaded &#8220;normies&#8221; ? Well, then it has no chance against entrenched competitors. Is it for people who like to think rationally sometimes (or, preferably, most of the time) ? Then it&#8217;s a niche product, and while it can succeed, it&#8217;s going to be an uphill battle all the way &#8212; there just aren&#8217;t that many people who are looking for rationalist dates. Is it for capital-R Rationalists ? Well, then it&#8217;s pointless, because they all live the the Bay Area and are already all dating each other; plus, their numbers are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lPytfSy-04&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1414" rel="nofollow">rather small.</a> You&#8217;d be better off just moving to San Francisco and dating them in person.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You&#8217;re on to something. If you measure reciprocity.io as a dating site, you won&#8217;t see the point.<br />
But it&#8217;s not a dating site, and should not be judged as such.  </p>
<p>Dating sites solve the issue of &#8216;I don&#8217;t know anyone I want to date&#8217;.<br />
Reciprocity addresses &#8216;I&#8217;m an awkward nerd who fancies someone I already know, but am too shy to ask out.&#8217;<br />
The only situation it prevents is two people mutually crushing on each other. While limited, this failure mode is much more tractable than dating in general.</p>

<p>One way to potentially improve the site is to allow multiple check boxes for each person, including one that is &#8220;I&#8217;d like to hang out with you in real life.&#8221;</p>
<p>This would increase the usefulness beyond dating &amp; also allow for plausible deniability when you harangue your friends into using it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That is&#8230; already on the site.  It is, as mentioned above, not very useful, because there&#8217;s not many cases there when one would be unwilling to ask directly.  Only case I can think of is if the person lives far away and I don&#8217;t actually know them very well (in which case it is unlikely though certainly not impossible that I&#8217;m friends with them on Facebook).</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t thought of using it purely for plausible deniability of the sort you mention, but I think it would fail pretty badly at that.  I&#8217;m not about to do such a thing one way or another.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>No on two counts.</p>
<p>First, my wife has injured her foot so we aren&#8217;t going. Alas.</p>
<p>But I did get another response via email from a mostly-lurker who will be there. I&#8217;ll leave it to this individual to decide whether to reply to you in public, but it means there will be another SSCer on board. I&#8217;d be very curious whether the two of you find each other.</p>
<p>Have a great time!</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I asked this last open thread, but too late to get many opinions: What is the current least-sucky dating site?</p>
<p>I find myself semi-on-the-market, have never bothered using one, and don’t know where to start. I’m poly, do not intend to marry or have kids, but don’t have much interest in purely casual sex either. I have one girlfriend, but we don’t expect it to be permanent. I am Grey Tribe.</p>
<p>The only sites I know anything about are Tindr (which may not suit, given the lack of interest in casual sex) and OkCupid (which I’ve heard has gone downhill in recent years).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I can&#8217;t point you at specific sites, but the general idea is a) something free to use or cheap, b) with lots of users. Online dating is a statistics game, so finding something you can automate and data-mine is good.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Error</p>
<p>Tindr seems to be more and more used for regular dating. My theory is that due to how gender differences impact dating, as well due to many people desiring both casual sex and a relationship, it is pretty much inevitable that both sites that initially focus on casual sex and those who focus on long term relationship, move over time to a mixture of the two. So, if you are decently good looking, Tindr seems like a fine option to find relationships.</p>
<p>Supposedly, OKCupid is better for nerdy people and/or people whose looks are their worst feature. However, looks seem to still be very important there.</p>
<p>So my advice, from a person who has traits and a lack of experience* that means you should not take this very seriously, is to try/use both (at least until Luna becomes available and you can buy a girlfriend**).</p>
<p>* and who in fact does not even have the option to examine the US dating ecosystem up close<br />
** please read this with a sarcastic inflection.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>CMB worked the best for me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how its algorithms work, but it purports to reward you for &#8220;good behavior&#8221; which seems to mean some combination of logging in every day, actually messaging your matches, and not being a jerk to people.  I got some pretty decent matches with real women willing to actually date pretty quick.  It seems to achieve the elusive goal of being a &#8220;female friendly&#8221; app that <i>isn&#8217;t</i> overtly feminist (like bumble, which is a cesspool)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m in a similar situation, but I feel that online dating is a colossal waste of time (assuming you&#8217;re cis straight male).  I do agree that taking it seriously can be very discouraging.  I would instead encourage going out to visit people in the Poly community (like going to a potluck or discussion group).</p>
<p>That all being said, this article seems most helpful for creating an online profile:  <a href="https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/DhQkDgLiYe28P3LHM/winning-is-for-losers" rel="nofollow">https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/DhQkDgLiYe28P3LHM/winning-is-for-losers</a></p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>This is a bit of an odd question, but I&#8217;m turning 18 in a few weeks and I assume that there are some interesting, useful, or amusing things which (in the US) are best done as a minor; anyone with interesting ideas of things they did or wish they&#8217;d done with their days of not-yet-being-a-legal-adult, feel free to share! I often wish I could get advice from a future version of myself another decade down the road, and the SSC commenting population is about as close a substitute as can be found. (More generally, any advice or information that you feel would be useful to an SSC-reading math-oriented college student is welcome.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Most of the stuff fun stuff that&#8217;s best done as a minor are illegal, and if you&#8217;re only a few weeks from being 18, they can and will try you as an adult. You already missed your window man. </p>
<p>Personally, one of my few regrets is not pressing the buttons on the jetway control pannel when i was a little kid. It was fairly common in a certain airport i used to fly out of for the operators to just leave the key in the panel, with all the lights beckoning me to reach out and touch. Just one push on the lever and the whole thing would have moved with a great big shudder, giving a great fright to everyone boarding the plane. It would have been <i>amazing</i>. Alas, i never got the guts to do it, and eventually i realized that i was too old to get away with it.</p>
<p>As for advice, well are you the kind of bright student who tends to ace tests without studying too hard? Because if you are, you&#8217;d should start brushing up on your note-taking and study skills. You can only go so far just by being smart, at some point you&#8217;re going to have to start putting in work, and if you haven&#8217;t reached that point yet, it&#8217;s going to hit you like a wall. Best be ready.</p>

<p>Obviously I don&#8217;t advise murdering or raping someone you hate, but if it&#8217;s some crime that doesn&#8217;t actually harm anyone, the time to do it is when you are under age and the authorities will probably write you off as being &#8220;young and foolish.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I am a future version of an US-residing about-to-turn-18 math-oriented college student 10 years down the road (well, a little more than 10, and SSC didn&#8217;t exist at the time, so I can&#8217;t say &#8220;SSC-reading&#8221;&#8230;). Anyway, I&#8217;ve racked my brains and I honestly can&#8217;t think of a single awesome thing that one <i>stops</i> being able to do at the cusp of legal adulthood, unless you value the thrill of doing something illegal, or want to save some money by entering some attractions more cheaply as a minor. Seriously, young adulthood is a time when a bunch of doors are opening and I can&#8217;t really think of any that are closing. So congratulations on reaching that point, enjoy yourself, and happy birthday!</p>
<p>I will say one thing in terms of indirect general advice to a decade-younger version of myself: if you&#8217;re interested in getting into a relationship or even just casual dating, there are a <i>lot</i> more attractive singles in one&#8217;s peer group at college age, and there&#8217;s far more leeway for people who don&#8217;t really know what they&#8217;re doing where navigating the dating game is concerned. And I wish I&#8217;d found a way to take better advantage of that. Take that as you will. (I imagine a similar thing is true about socializing in general, but my perspective is different there because I <i>did</i> manage to take advantage of that.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>When I was growing up, in Ontario, there was a special legal exemption in the laws about sexual consent. The general age of consent was 16. But in cases where there was no more than two years between the partners, and neither was in a position of authority over the other, the age of consent was 14. So, if you wanted to have legal sex with a very young partner, you needed to do it while you yourself were young.</p>
<p>I expect there are similar laws elsewhere.</p>
<p>Before you book a flight to Toronto, let me mention that the law in Ontario may have changed since those days. I have no reason to stay current on these matters.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think it&#8217;s a federally-set thing, and those are the current laws. <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canada-s-age-of-consent-raised-by-2-years-1.754941" rel="nofollow">Until 2008</a> it was 14 with no restrictions except a position of authority exception (in which case it was 16, I think). Best thing the Harper government did: 14 is way too young, and a decent chunk of sexual assault cases involved grown men having sex with 14 or 15 year olds; today they are a lot easier to prosecute.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I wonder if this also works if you practice circular breathing on other instruments (there&#8217;s a bassoon professor at Arizona State who taught all his students to circular breathe). Or if you practice didgeridoo without the circular breathing.</p>
<p>Circular breathing isn&#8217;t <i>that</i> hard, it&#8217;s a bit like learning to pat your head while rubbing your stomach. Maybe one step more complicated.* If learning that is what helps with sleep apnea, then this is a pretty huge deal.</p>
<p><i>*I got circular breathing down in the first few hours, and got it down smoothly within a week. From my several years playing the didgeridoo, I&#8217;d say the really hard part of that instrument is learning how to make and integrate all those weird barks and huffs and other noises, and of course keeping a steady interesting dynamic rhythm going for a long time without screwing it up.</i></p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Wait, wait, wait, patting your head while rubbing your stomach is something people have to <i>learn</i>? Like i just tried it and it took me all of three seconds to figure it out. Circular breathing on the other hand, does seem like a thing that would take a few hours of practice to get down.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I definitely had to consciously practice for a while to be able to do it &#8212; although I was pretty young at the time (I want to say 5ish), so &#8220;a while&#8221; might have been several tries practicing for a few minutes each time. Even now I have to stop what I&#8217;m doing and think carefully and set up the motions right.</p>
<p>(Possibly related &#8212; can you tap out a hemiola rhythm at a steady tempo? I think that&#8217;s a similar &#8220;need to learn&#8221; skill, although possibly hard to separate that from the &#8220;tap at a steady tempo&#8221; skill &#8212; from my experience in music people are actually really bad at keeping a steady tempo if they don&#8217;t practice with a metronome or something.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>i can tap out the heartbeat of a Time Lord for a bit but the tempo wavers a little and eventually i trip myself up. After looking up what a hemiola is, and looking at a couple of demonstrations, i tried it a few times. Wound up always getting tripped up after the second or third loop. It&#8217;s harder because it feels like trying to keep two different tempos in your head, rapidly switching between the one and the other in quick succession.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Wait, wait, wait, patting your head while rubbing your stomach is something people have to learn? Like i just tried it and it took me all of three seconds to figure it out.</p></blockquote>
<p>I didn&#8217;t say that learning to circular breathe is a comparable level of difficulty to learning how to pat your head and rub your stomach. I said learning the one was a bit like learning the other. What I meant was basically what you said: you have to think about it and do it a few times.</p>
<p>My point is it isn&#8217;t this weird process that hardly anyone could learn to do.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I find it easiest to remember by recalling that it&#8217;s short for &#8220;Rotate 13&#8221;, which is just a substitution cipher where you rotate 13 letters through the alphabet (i.e., &#8220;ABC&#8221; is &#8220;NOP&#8221;).  ROT4 would go from A&gt;E, ROT5 A&gt;F, etc.  If you use 13, however, encrypting and decrypting is the same.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Agreed; I think that <i>Pyre</i> suffers a little from trying to be too many things at the same time. It&#8217;s a visual novel RPG eldritch combat basketball. The fact that it works at all is already a minor miracle; the fact that it&#8217;s actually good is nothing short of amazing.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Definitely! Really good visuals and incredible music, too.</p>
<p>I also concur fairly strongly with one of your footnotes.  Specifically: </p>
<blockquote><p>As much as I love Transistor, the game is too opaque for its own good. If it had taken some time to slow down and lay out some basic rules about the game world at this point, the game would have been much improved</p></blockquote>
<p>My own feeling is that Transistor has a bunch of really interesting ideas, but that much of the opaqueness is meant to conceal some parts where the developers had a really rich vein of theme but not enough coherence, and so just threw a bunch of cool stuff out and let the players make connections (or not).</p>
<p>ETA:<br />
I also really like your analysis of the Man and what he represents in Part 4. Again, I think that Transistor is structured to be ambiguous entirely so that people can find their own readings of it, but that is a really solid and interesting one.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Thanks! </p>
<p>And I agree on your analysis of the game&#8217;s themes&gt;execution. I wonder if the developers originally wanted to explain much more but ended up cutting a lot of content. The early marketing material barely resembles the finished game. I remember one trailer said something like &#8220;5 assassins hunt Red and the Transistor down.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Braid is a pretty fun little puzzle/platformer, but as far as story and theme goes, it seemed to think it had way more to say than it actually did.</p>
<p>It pretty much doesn&#8217;t hold a candle to any of Supergiant&#8217;s stuff.  Bastion and Transistor (still haven&#8217;t played Pyre, unfortunately) both weave a complex (if sometimes obfustaced) narrative with deep themes into an aesthetic and gameplay sensibility that match those themes.  Braid, on the other hand, presents a simple narrative, with a simple theme, and purposefully obfuscates it to try to make it seem deeper than it actually is.  The time manipulating mechanics do a good job of reflecting that theme, though.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Well, it likely won&#8217;t change your life or anything, but it&#8217;s an interesting use of aesthetics blended with mechanics, so I thought I&#8217;d bring it up.</p>
<p>I agree with the commentators above that it tries to be a bit more than it delivers.  Still good tho.</p>
<p>Anyways, thanks for making me aware of Transistor!  I think I&#8217;ll give it a whirl before reading your whole thing, seems like the sort of thing best read post-facto.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I loved Braid (though it was too short, and the difference in difficulty in completing the regular game and collecting all the stars was a ridiculously huge gulf). Sure, the story was a bit pretentious, but I&#8217;m standing here from the perspective of someone whose first computer was a ZX Spectrum, wondering why the hell you would play a computer game for the <i>story.</i></p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think I got partway through and then reached a boss I was not skilled enough to beat, and wound up abandoning it. It&#8217;s a shame, since I really loved Bastion and wanted to see the end of Transistor, but that boss fight was way tough and apparently the designers thought it was a good idea to punish you for failing by taking away another one of your combat skills every time, which does not exactly make the fight easier.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Does anybody have any recommendations for a tutorial for LaTeX, especially with an eye towards customizing classes?  Creating a documents with the basic classes seems pretty straightforward (and produces pretty-looking documents quite easily!)  Now, to develop my understanding of how LaTeX puts together documents, I&#8217;d like to try poking around &#8220;under the hood&#8221;.</p>
<p>However, trying to get information about how to do any customization is kind of frustrating.  I see references to compiling &#8220;source2e.tex&#8221; for documentation (OK, distributing documentation in a non-human readable and making the user compile it makes a weird sort of sense for a typesetting program).  However, I can&#8217;t seem to compile it for my distribution (MiKTeX), since it apparently incorporates other (.dtx) files that weren&#8217;t included&#8211;I think.  When you can&#8217;t compile the help file it gets a little difficult to look things up.  I have, of course, found a compiled version online, but question if there are differences between that one and the one that I would get from my own system.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found various courses by Google search, but even that seems a little hinky.  One of the ones recommended by a rollup of LaTeX tutorials was a presentation slideshow (would be a PowerPoint slideshow, except it was in LaTeX, not PP, of course).  Not really the super-greatest form of information transfer.  But, aesthetically, the slideshow is very nice.</p>
<p>Since I like to do these kinds of things by doing a toy project that I might be able to actually use later, my target is to create a class that will correctly typeset a formal memo on Department of the Army letterhead.  The reason I&#8217;ve chosen this is because the requirements are well specified (Army Regulation 25-50 lays out exactly how margins, paragraph numbering, pagination, signature blocks, etc. are to be laid out), but they&#8217;re fiddly enough that actually doing it correctly will be a challenge (for example, the signature block at the end of the memo has 4 blank lines as room for the signature, but the signature block must be kept together with the previous paragraph and the previous paragraph must have at least two lines on a page&#8211;so if the last paragraph is only three lines total it must keep the whole paragraph on the next page with the signature block)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a Word template with the letterhead to automagically create the proper paragraph numbering, but anything but the simplest documents does require some hand-fiddling to comply with the pagination rules.  More complicated things like SEE DISTRIBUTION lists have to be hand done.  I&#8217;d like to see if I can switch it over to LaTeX and leave it mostly automated.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s up to you whether consulting an appendix in something that you haven&#8217;t paid for is acceptable, but when say &#8220;isn&#8217;t very hard to track down&#8221; I mean it isn&#8217;t very hard to turn up a PDF with a bit of searching.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>A recommended (vast) course of typographic study:</p>
<p>(0) obtain the complete <a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/" rel="nofollow">TeXLive distribution</a> (free for all platforms)<br />
(1) acquire motivation: read Donald Knuth&#8217;s AMS article &#8220;<a href="http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1979-01-02/S0273-0979-1979-14598-1/" rel="nofollow">Mathematical Typography</a>&#8221; (1979, free) and Knuth&#8217;s book <i>The Errors of Tex</i> (1989, not free)<br />
(2) learn user-conventions: Gratzner&#8217;s &#8220;More Math into LaTeX&#8221; (not free, covers more than just math)<br />
(3) learn the basics of document design: \documentclass{memoir}, and documentation &#8216;memman.pdf&#8217;<br />
(4) tie it all together with the command-line utility &#8216;latexmk&#8221; (which is the unix utility &#8216;make&#8221; generalized for typographic production)<br />
&#8212;&#8211;<br />
At this point you will be able to produce pretty good documents of all kinds &#8230; documents infinitely superior to anything that Microsoft Word and/or Adobe Illustrator can produce &#8230;  that are generated entirely by readily-automated command-line idioms &#8230; </p>
<p>&#8230; and you will be motivated to learn more &#8230; MUCH MORE !!!<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
(5) learn graphics: \usepackage{tikz}, and documentation &#8216;pdfmanual.pdf&#8217;<br />
(6) learn presentation design: \documentclass{beamer}, and documentation &#8216;memman.pdf&#8217;<br />
(7) study <i>The LaTeX Companion</i> to learn how to code packages yourself &#8230;<br />
(8) study typographic tuning:  \usepackage{microtype},<br />
(9) study critical edition usage: \usepackage{reledpar}</p>
<p>Now you are prepared to learn the basics of (LaTeX) font-design &#8230; itself a discipline of near-infinite domain and range.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The big specific difference are mostly cultural.</p>
<p>Gender roles:<br />
The Kenyan&#8211;very patriarchal.  The man is the head of the home; he&#8217;s entirely responsible for meeting all the needs of all his people.  Anything his wife makes is great and helpful, but fundamentally making sure there&#8217;s enough money to meet the needs is not her problem.  The American&#8211;much more &#8220;separate spheres&#8221;&#8211;the man has his income and buys what&#8217;s important to him, the wife has her income and the household is mostly her responsibility.</p>
<p>Social self-image:<br />
The Kenyan&#8211;very accustomed to being in charge.  Was trained to lead and expected to lead, and has a vision of leadership that&#8217;s mostly about responsibility to your followers.  The American&#8211;accustomed to a world run by other people.  Your primary relationships are with peers, and you might help them out but you aren&#8217;t responsible for them.</p>
<p>These are the two differences I think of first.  I&#8217;d sum them up as &#8220;the Kenyan is used to a much more hierarchical society, and was trained for a position as a leader in such a society.&#8221;</p>

<p>My wife (black) and I (white) are different in a lot of ways &#8212; politically, religiously, and in terms of our socioeconomic background (about which I&#8217;ll say: hers was much more comfortable and stable than mine; I grew up pretty poor and hungry while she grew up solidly middle-class; but, my family is culturally very SWPL while hers is culturally very black middle-class, which is a lot like white middle-class but with certain things swapped out for other things).</p>

<p>Would you elaborate on this? It sounds interesting. As a European, I have practically no idea about what the American black middle class is like.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Certain foods are different, for instance. Whereas a white family eats a lot of mashed potatoes during winter holidays, a black family eats sweet potato pie.</p>
<p>Tastes in music are different too: while driving and listening to the radio for example, white middle-class middle-aged people in the US tend to tune to classic rock (Eagles, Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, etc.) and country, whereas their black counterparts tune to R&amp;B, soul, and smooth jazz.</p>
<p>My wife grew up watching all the Eddie Murphy, Whoopi Goldberg, and Wesley Snipes movies from the 80s and 90s, because her parents watched them. A lot of white people watched them too, but I get the sense they were kind of &#8220;standard viewing&#8221; in middle-class black homes, the way Schindler&#8217;s List and Fiddler on the Roof were in Jewish homes.</p>
<p>The art on the wall at my in-laws, when it represents people, features black people almost exclusively. During Christmas, all the Santa imagery depicts a black Santa.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m not married, but my father&#8217;s (white, English, Anglican, upper middle class, early 60s) marriage to my stepmother (Punjabi, English, Catholic, middle class, mid 40s) seems great. They&#8217;ve been married I think 14 years, are terrific parents to their two sons, get on well with each other&#8217;s families, and so far as I know (and I see a lot of them) have never had any significant marital problems. She can&#8217;t receive Catholic communion, because she&#8217;s married a divorcé, but that&#8217;s the only cultural problem I&#8217;m aware of. They live in a small, prosperous, almost exclusively white (there&#8217;s also a Japanese woman who&#8217;s married to a white man with mixed race kids) village in the home counties.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My mum is Australian (British, German, Irish, etc.). </p>
<p>My dad is Mexican (60% native American, 30% Spanish). </p>
<p>The marriage is very good. </p>
<p>Our family has been living in Australia for the past 20 years, and my dad doesn&#8217;t retain most aspects of Mexican culture.</p>
<p>I know you probably asked this because you think marriages like this won&#8217;t work, because of culture or something. Or maybe that black people are innately unable to treat white women according to the standards that they desire.</p>
<p>Honestly I don&#8217;t know in general, but my parent&#8217;s marriage does not satisy this pattern. My dad is very smart and has discarded/destroyed a lot of his traditional cultural values (he was raised in Calfiornia) and replaced them with his own. He is very ambitious and cooperative, and he cooperates well in the marriage. </p>
<p>I know marriages are meant to suck, and I&#8217;m sure my parents&#8217; is no exception, but as far as I can tell it&#8217;s going fine.</p>

<p>In the Bay Area, I often encounter people who are &#8220;ambiguously brown-yellow&#8221; and it&#8217;s a toss-up if they&#8217;re Asian or Latino, but more often they&#8217;re both.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>So apparently when I said I was starting that GURPS game in &#8220;the next OT&#8221; I really meant the next integer OT. Who knew!</p>
<p>For those who missed it; I&#8217;m GMing a play-by-forum-post semi-hard-ish original setting sci-fi space adventure GURPS game and anyone who hangs around here is welcome to come join. I make no claim to be good at GMing but it&#8217;s almost always net positive fun.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s happening <a href="https://www.myth-weavers.com/game.php?g=30733" rel="nofollow">here</a>. There won&#8217;t be as much stuff as I hoped there would be when you get there but&#8230; just read what information is there and ask questions in the OOC thread if you&#8217;re confused about anything I guess. </p>
<p>You will have to register an account with Myth-Weavers; then click the &#8220;join game&#8221; button on the left side of the page I linked to above and click the &#8220;game forum&#8221; bit to see the actual forum where it&#8217;s going on.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I have just developed a new game called Procrastination™. It is an <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdleGame" rel="nofollow">idle game</a>, which means that the game requires no intervention, you automatically get a higher score over time.</p>
<p>To do the name justice, the game doesn&#8217;t require registration, instead, everyone on SSC is autoregistered.</p>
<p>Since I believe in symmetry, I wanted to name to be true to the developer experience as well. So I have not actually developed anything. This means that there is no way to check the score, but checking the score would just lower your score anyway.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m planning to hash that out with the people there once they get there. I&#8217;d like people to commit to posting at least once every other day but &#8220;posting&#8221; might take you anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour depending on what you&#8217;re making your character do.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an asynchronous sort of deal unless two characters are talking to each other. You say &#8220;Florbnortz decides to go shopping for anti-rad meds,&#8221; and then at some point that same day I show up and tell you that poor Florbnortz encounters a mugger on the way, and then you come back the next day to post about what Florbnortz says to the mugger.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ve started Bryan Caplan&#8217;s &#8220;The Case against Education&#8221;. So far, Caplan has leveled his main charges against the education system:<br />
&#8211; the education system (meaning college, mainly) conveys little knowledge that is actually useful to students<br />
&#8211; education is highly sought after mainly because it is valued by employers<br />
&#8211; the highly educated are valued by employers mostly because their educations are hard-to-fake signals of three valuable qualities: intelligence, conscientiousness, and conformity.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll have more to say later as I get farther into the book.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>More the latter, I think. Caplan isn&#8217;t opposed to all education. He acknowledges that some things, such as literacy and numeracy, are obviously useful. And he has good things to say about parts of modern education, the more vocational the better. He is mostly kicking general education or perhaps the liberal arts.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You make it sound like he just wants to reform the system a little bit. Caplan biggest problem with education isn’t with what is taught, it’s the mandatory(quasi-mandatory, with regards to university) nature of its existence. For the most part, he wants to abolish the whole thing. Anything kept is vastly different and based on what students want to learn and maybe a few very general skills like reading, writing and basic math.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Liberal arts <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshuaMound/status/962790271284072449" rel="nofollow">certainly deserves to be kicked</a>.</p>
<p>(I went through liberal arts in college, and was disappointed to find that that tweet is entirely right. That&#8217;s not to say that the program itself was dogmatic &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t, and we could push back against Rawls and the like all day with no social consequence, although the Christians didn&#8217;t fare so well. But, somehow, the people who get big in academia are all the most tepid and soulless party hacks the world has to offer, more Vogonate than a government bureaucrat. And it&#8217;s gotten worse since I graduated, and  everything that isn&#8217;t my particular discipline was irredeemably awful even then.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>the education system (meaning college, mainly) conveys little knowledge that is actually useful to students</p></blockquote>
<p>The main counterclaim there is going to be that, it&#8217;s not about knowledge it&#8217;s about skills.</p>
<blockquote><p>the highly educated are valued by employers mostly because their educations are hard-to-fake signals of three valuable qualities: intelligence, conscientiousness, and conformity.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen the argument (here among other places) that at least as to the first, it could be replaced by an IQ test, if only if it weren&#8217;t for Griggs v. Duke Power. But even leaving aside that the case doesn&#8217;t actually ban IQ tests outright, what about other countries? Are white collar employers in Canada, the UK, Germany, or Japan any less likely than in the US to demand college degrees or administer IQ tests?</p>
<p>N.B. I&#8217;m bitter about a huge amount of student loan debt and so am predisposed to like BC&#8217;s argument.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>IQ tests only measure intelligence, not conscientiousness and conformity. An average IQ person with a college degree is very likely to be a better employee than a high IQ person who dropped out of college. It&#8217;s completely reasonable to expect that someone who could not hack it in school will also be unable to function in an office environment, and employers discriminate accordingly. This solution is therefore quite inadequate.</p>

<blockquote><p>The main counterclaim there is going to be that, it’s not about knowledge it’s about skills.</p></blockquote>
<p>And perhaps more controversially, the skills that people learn may not be the skills that are taught.</p>
<p>My college education featured lots of math and I don&#8217;t feel particularly capable of doing complex math now and even less inclined to put in the effort, but I suspect that it may have greatly improved my ability to think logically. Learning and practicing math may have changed my brain in very beneficial ways. These changes may be best achieved by teaching math, but then be far more universally applicable, to non-math problem solving.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Same here. The actual content of all the papers I wrote in college was utterly irrelevant to my post-college life (although I still think the topics I was studying were interesting), but the ability to crap out a reasonably coherent written product on demand, even when I would much rather be doing something else, has proven immensely valuable.</p>
<p>It’s the “Wax on, wax off” theory of education. The point isn’t the stuff you’re taking the class about, it’s the process you learn to do it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t think raw intelligence is the only thing that matters in the job market. Sure, it&#8217;s very important; but it&#8217;s only one component of the required ability: solving novel problems quickly and correctly. </p>
<p>Sure, if you are super-smart, you can reinvent your entire field on the fly from first principles. However, most people are not that smart. Hence, college is supposed to teach you some of the known solutions to basic problems in your field; but more than that, it&#8217;s supposed to teach you the general approach people have been using to solve problems, and to advance the state of the art (as well as general work/study skills, of course). Without such foundations, most people &#8212; yes, even smart ones &#8212; would not be able to get much useful work done.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s important not to exaggerate what Caplan is saying. He is not saying that all of education, or even all of high school and college, is useless. But he does think that at least a third and possibly as much as 80% of it is useless. It is useless in the sense that it teaches knowledge and skills that aren&#8217;t useful to the students. And he therefore want us to stop doing that, damn it.</p>
<p>The problem with the claim of uselessness is that high school graduates and college graduates get paid much better than those who failed to complete high school and college, which is hard to square with his claim of uselessness. His answer is that high school and college educations are valued not for the skills they convey, but for the pre-existing qualities they reveal, namely intelligence, conscientiousness, and conformity. (And presumably he has some better cheaper way of doing that, but I haven&#8217;t finished the book yet.)</p>

<p>Indeed. Caplan and all his fellow anti-educationists (who include Scott, to some extent) are effectively arguing that there is an obvious, large, global, persistent and in fact increasing, market inefficiency. This seems to run counter to basic economic reasoning.</p>
<blockquote><p>His answer is that high school and college educations are valued not for the skills they convey, but for the pre-existing qualities they reveal, namely intelligence, conscientiousness, and conformity. </p></blockquote>
<p>Which demolishes his claim that education is useless. We could steelman Caplan&#8217;s thesis by arguing that education could be made more efficient if in addition to signaling it also taught more useful knowledge or skills, though I&#8217;m not sure exactly how to accomplish this, but it&#8217;s unlikely that education could be significantly shortened without sacrificing its signaling value.</p>
<blockquote><p>(And presumably he has some better cheaper way of doing that, but I haven’t finished the book yet.)</p></blockquote>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t hold my breath.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>One question: </p>
<p>It&#8217;s quite plausible that most of us forget most of what we study in college.  But most of us also don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re going to be doing in the rest of our lives.  So at least some of the stuff we&#8217;ve forgotten is stuff that we might have ended up needing, but didn&#8217;t.  (Like, I once had a class in COBOL.  I have never had any reason to write any COBOL, and probably couldn&#8217;t write &#8220;Hello, World!&#8221; in it at this point.  But it wasn&#8217;t totally crazy to take a class in it, since I couldn&#8217;t know when I took it that it would never be worthwhile.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>vV_Vv:</p>
<p>Greg Cochran&#8217;s discussion of Caplan&#8217;s work points this out, but from the starting assumption that such market inefficiencies can exist just because people aren&#8217;t all that bright.  (In particular, the HR department is usually not populated from the very brightest, most innovative, or most risk-accepting people in the world.)  </p>
<p>The destructive thing about using education as an IQ and personality test is that it&#8217;s so expensive, and there seems to be an arms race going on, where more and more jobs use college degrees as entry requirements even when there&#8217;s nothing about the job that requires advanced education, because it&#8217;s an easy way to filter for minimal intelligence and diligence.  The result is that you need a college degree to get hired as a clerk, whereas thirty years ago, a high school diploma would have been sufficient.  And so you get the same job your dad got, but you get it after four more years in school and $30K in student loan debt.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&gt;This is about as “market” as the US healthcare system, with its lack of price information caused by government meddling.</p>
<p>The market we are talking about is the employment market.   Employers can hire anyone they want, and they are willing to pay much, much more for people with an education.    The natural conclusion is that employers must think that educated employees are more productive </p>

<p>I think we can now say pretty conclusively that rationalists don&#8217;t &#8220;win&#8221; any more than the demographics they&#8217;re drawn from, unless you&#8217;re denominating winnings in blog output, cuddles, or familiarity with cog-sci buzzwords.  </p>
<p>The community&#8217;s about ten years old.  There are people who&#8217;ve been in it from the beginning, read the Sequences, gone to workshops, done everything Eliezer Yudkowsky says you should do.  I know a lot of those people.  Some of them are impressively accomplished, but those that are, were (or were heading that way) before they joined the community, and those that aren&#8217;t, haven&#8217;t gotten noticeably better.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Which demolishes his claim that education is useless. </p></blockquote>
<p>It does not. You have to actually do a cost benefit analysis and compare the alternatives. The societal benefit is tiny compared to the costs in this case. And given that this is a zero-sum arms race, you could retain most of the benefits simply by moving everyone down the ladder by one rung. Ranking preserved, costs decreased.</p>
<blockquote><p>Why is that considered so implausible?</p></blockquote>
<p>The plausibility of the hypothesis has nothing to do with it. It&#8217;s the mountain of evidence against it that matters.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Which demolishes his claim that education is useless.</p></blockquote>
<p>It does the absolute opposite of that. Forget that education could be made more efficient; signalling could be made more efficient! Instead of going to college for four years, you could go to work for one year at the company as an intern or something; saves time, accomplishes more. If they like you at the end of that year, they hire you. Why isn&#8217;t this system already in place?</p>
<p>Plus, most people think that education actually makes you better at things and this is the agreed-upon &#8220;worth&#8221; that education has in our society. In my opinion this is also an accurate way to look at things, but anyways; this refutes those arguments. If you disagree with this conception of worth, fine, but you are far in the minority (and in my opinion you&#8217;re wrong to boot).</p>
<blockquote><p>On a side note, considering the whole rationalist community is kind of based on the idea that you can learn to be more rational by doing things like reading the sequences and blog posts and going to workshops and such, and that people who are more rational can “win” more, I’m surprised to find such doubt around the idea that maybe a general well rounded education really can make people more effective in general. Why is that considered so implausible?</p></blockquote>
<p>because this is the SSC community, not the rationalist community</p>
<p>yes there&#8217;s significant overlap but I am much more interested in being part of the former than the latter, not least because Scott Alexander &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Eliezer Yudkowski.</p>
<p>But anyways, I think being a rationalist is about learning generally applicable methods to things; I don&#8217;t think that works the same in regards to mathematics. It&#8217;s not like becoming a rationalist will increase my ability to solve equations or vice versa, and as an empiricist I&#8217;m uncomfortable with the idea of that being true because it&#8217;s so dang hard to measure (and in my specific case, I feel like a lot of people use it as a general excuse where it&#8217;s not particularly warranted to defend traditional institutions that no longer have any reason to exist, if they ever did.) On top of all that though, most people don&#8217;t have any need for these higher-level skills or interest in learning them; you can lead a horse to water but you can&#8217;t make it drink, and if the horse doesn&#8217;t need water then you should just accept that and move on with your existence.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>A lot of people responded to my post, and maybe I should have been more clear.      </p>
<p>My prior would be that getting a general education which includes at least some  basics of math, science, statistics and research methods, history, economics, philosophy, ect, in an academic setting that has research and formal paper writing with logical arguments and evidence and all of that, would in general help people become at least somewhat more rational than baseline, all else being equal.       I would expect other benefits as well, but that one at least is one I would expect to benefit most people.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ve been reading it also. I have a question about it.</p>
<p>He examines three different hypotheses for why successful people are more likely to be educated:</p>
<p>-The signaling hypothesis&#8211;that education doesn&#8217;t so much teach you things, as it signals to employers that you are competent.<br />
-The human capital hypothesis&#8211;that schools actually do teach you things. For example, according to this hypothesis, if you had a good education, but no actual paperwork to show off that you got said education, you would still be successful.<br />
-Ability bias&#8211;that competent people go to school, and those same people would be successful even without education.</p>
<p>Now, he goes on to state that the real reason is probably some mix of all these hypotheses, then he goes on to try to figure out how much of the mix is actual learning, and how much is signaling. (Spoiler: He thinks it&#8217;s mostly signaling, hence the title of the book.) But it seems like he completely forget about ability bias.</p>
<p>For instance, he talks about the benefits of a high school degree, but I know people who never finished high school, yet still went to college, so right away I&#8217;m confused as to how that fits in. Shouldn&#8217;t that prove that a lot of the benefits of high school are caused by ability bias? He doesn&#8217;t seem to examine this possibility, does he?</p>
<p>Aside from that I like a lot of the other things in the book. The explanation of the signaling model is pretty enlightening. I feel like a lot of stuff about education and job hunting now makes more sense.</p>
<p>It also made me come to the depressing realization that the education system was designed almost for the sole purpose of filtering out people like me; I was accurately filtered out. I had previously thought that not having a college degree wasn&#8217;t a big deal. And it&#8217;s not a big deal in and of itself, but the fact that I couldn&#8217;t get one, when it didn&#8217;t seem too hard for a lot of other people proves some things about me. I&#8217;m pretty much a defective human, and I just never realized I&#8217;m defective, since my defect prevents me from seeing my defect.</p>
<p>Now I need to figure out how to contribute to society without my defect interfering.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Now I need to figure out how to contribute to society without my defect interfering.</p></blockquote>
<p>It depends on what your defect is, an in what area you&#8217;re trying to contribute. For example, I know a few successful scientists and software engineers with ADD or depression; some of them mitigate it through prescription drugs, other learned to plan around it. Some of them finished college; others did not, but they did manage to learn quite a lot from online courses and self-study. On the other hand, I hardly know of any mechanics who would say that college was instrumental in their careers; apprenticeship under an experienced mechanic seems to count for a lot more. Of course, serious physical disability would pretty much preclude a person from taking any kind of a job that requires manual labor; this is not something you can work around (yet).</p>
<p>That said, I don&#8217;t know all that many people in general, so I don&#8217;t have data, just anecdotes&#8230;</p>

<p>On the positive side, I think that at middle to top levels of society, there is more room for people with major defects to find a decent niche than in the past. This may not be true at the low end of society or in some specific ways (like relationships), but if you are posting here there is a reasonable chance that a good niche may exist for you when it comes to finding a job (although this may mean not looking for &#8216;standard&#8217; jobs).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think it depends on the college, and on your major. Some college/major combinations do indeed make it a goal to teach specific employment-related skills; others aim to teach enough theory, critical thinking, and work/study habits to make it easy to acquire a variety of skills in the discipline. In the latter case, the education is not merely a signal of intelligence and conscientiousness, but rather their direct cause.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s often told how the higher education is supposed to teach proper work and study habits; however, in fact college incentivizes pretty subpar work ethics, which becomes painfully obvious the moment you look at how most college students actually study.</p>
<p>If anything, the higher education has corrupted my work habits, which later took quite an effort to restore. It could be argued that subpar work habits are still better than no work habits at all; but if they were any good, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s unlikely that a college would improve them.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I haven&#8217;t read the book, but I have read every one of his blog posts on the subject, and here is my impression of his belief.  Roughly 80% of all gains on education are from signalling.  It does not make sense to subsidize something that is mostly about signalling, since it encourages greater and greater competition for only 20% the benefit of the cost. He would end all government spending on education and let the private sector readjust to only provide better services. Education would still exist, but it would become more vocational, and there would be more internships and apprenticeships, since they could provide more human capital and still signal the three factors.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what he thinks would happen if the government stopped funding education, but here are my thoughts. Parents will still send their students to elementary and middle school, but the average school would spend much less per student, have larger class sizes, and focus on literacy and numeracy. Most high schools and colleges would close, and people would start working earlier. Liberal arts education would be considered a luxery expense rich people do to signal high status and sophistication. Professional grad school would still exist, in fewer number, and the return on their education would be much lower. Most jobs would stop requiring degrees and have apprenticeship tracks where you learned on the job for minimum wage. Student debt might plummet though. Overall, I think GDP would increase significantly, but at the cost of most people being dumber, less cultured, and spending more of their life working hard instead of playing around.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>but at the cost of most people being dumber, less cultured, and spending more of their life working hard instead of playing around.</p></blockquote>
<p>My feeling is that culture learned in courses you had to take is too likely to end up as cocktail party conversation&#8211;knowing what to say about a subject without actually knowing the subject. That&#8217;s the end product of studying a subject not because you are interested in it but in order to pass the final exam. Culture acquired by reading books you like or arguing with people about subjects that interest you is more likely to be real.</p>
<p>So far as working hard, I think the result of Caplan&#8217;s reforms, assuming he is right about schooling, would be people spending less time working hard and more time enjoying themselves. The present system, after all, if we take the 80% wasted claim as correct, involves eight years times .8 of useless work. </p>
<p>To put it differently, if you start working eight years earlier and the first two years of apprenticeship are substituting for eight years of school, you could have the same lifetime wage profile and retire six years younger.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That&#8217;s a very good point on the culture, and I am inclined to agree with you, though I know some would scoff at popular culture. I am less sure of your argument that people would retire earlier. First, I think most of the gains would be spent on positional goods and not be put into savings or make anybody better off. Young people always have a smaller savings rate. Further, is there any evidence that starting work earlier, or having earning more results in earlier retirement? I have not studied this point much, but my impression is that retirement is based more on career tracks, when the body and mind start to atrophy, or when they are old enough to collect social security, than when people actually meet a magic number of savings. Please correct me if I&#8217;m wrong</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I personally have always hated liberal arts, but I have to admit that at least some of my courses on art history, general history, literature, and esoteric religions really did broaden my horizons.

<p>Then again, if optimizing your wage profile is your ultimate goal (and I honestly can&#8217;t present a logical argument for why it shouldn&#8217;t be), then enjoying things is actually detrimental, so you might be right&#8230;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>One really big opportunity cost from the present education system is delayed family formation (exceptions exist, but for a lot of highly-educated people this is true). Probably not too much from a bachelor degree alone, but add an extra degree or two plus the years it takes to pay off some debt and reach financial stability, and by then much of the optimal fertility period has passed. </p>
<p>In my view this is a bigger deal than retiring 6 years earlier.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>One could argue that certain Asian countries have partially disproved this theory (that government ceasing to subsidize education would drive earlier employment). It delayed the ratchet, as some kids indeed did not go to high school, while others went to vocational school in lieu of high school, but instead an entire economy revolving around the entrance exams developed, suicide rates increased, and jobs for those without diplomas or with only vocational certificates have dried up.<br />
And the richest then send their kids to school in America as the &#8220;easy out.&#8221; </p>
<p>So there&#8217;s not much consequentialist difference, except one system also has increased suicide rates.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Most jobs would stop requiring degrees and have apprenticeship tracks where you learned on the job for minimum wage.</p></blockquote>
<p>Citation needed, I would say.</p>
<p>The trend is for companies not even want to hire new college grads, let alone HS grads or (shudder), 14 year olds. They want people who already know how to be productive. These even extend to relatively low skill jobs like waiting tables, where I have seen people desperate to hire wait staff, but unwilling to hire people without a year of experience waiting tables.</p>
<p>Because employees are more mobile than in the past, companies are generally unwilling to train them to the point of productivity.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ve historically seen this but it might be changing, given the low unemployment rate. The last few hires in this office have had a lot of people with next to no relevant experience. I consider this a healthy development, because this job is so easy a caveman could do it.</p>
<p>So, possibly, this &#8220;you need X years of experience doing the same thing&#8221; is more a function of the unemployment rate than it is any structural change. It&#8217;s only recently (like, last quarter) that we&#8217;ve started seeing economy wide wage pressure.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Again, this was even at a restaurant that really wanted staff and was currently understaffed. Sure, anecdata and all that.</p>
<p>Still you are describing what happens under full employment. Most of the times economies aren&#8217;t running at full employment. As a for example, the US did not reached full-employment between 1978 to 2017 (at least according to Wikipedia).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to know exactly what the advent of gig-economy, tools, etc will do, but it seems unlikely to me that the net effect would be for employers to be more incented to provide &#8220;free&#8221; training for their employees, especially in a capital market where corporate employers are being evaluated on a quarter by quarter basis.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The argument is primarily about college education, not primary school or high school, which are assumed to teach you actually useful things (e.g. basic literacy and numeracy, foreign languages), make you learn very useful skills without explicitly teaching them (social skills, mostly) and keep you under adult supervision while your parents are at work.</p>
<p>Intelligence can be measured quickly and reliably with IQ tests, but as far as I can tell there are no reliable paper-and-pencil tests for conscientiousness and conformity. It could be well the case that the only way to assess these traits is to measure performance for multiple years over a number of relatively arbitrary tasks in a fairly structured environment. This is what college is about. Do you know any faster method to achieve the same thing?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Basic military training.</p></blockquote>
<p>So why aren&#8217;t employers hiring college-uneducated veterans for positions that would normally require a college degree?</p>
<p>Why does the military itself run academies and officer cadet schools, which are essentially equivalent to college, in order to train and select its officers?</p>
<p>Basic military training probably tests for conformity, in addition to physical fitness and an intelligence threshold: in order to pass it you must be able to complete simple but physically hard tasks under the close supervision of a commanding officer. It does not test for conscientiousness: the ability to plan and execute a multi-step task over several weeks or months, correctly pacing your work, without somebody watching over your shoulder telling you what to do next.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Having a high school diploma (as opposed to a GED) is predictive of first-term enlistment outcomes, conditioning on AFQT scores. There&#8217;s a personality test that&#8217;s been used that&#8217;s also predictive in research conditions; I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s even been actually implemented, or if it would be gamed if it were actually used as a criteria for enlistment. I would guess those are getting at conscientiousness.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>To elaborate a little and get more realistic, my answer wouldn&#8217;t <i>just</i> include &#8220;basic training&#8221; but more like &#8220;two years of entry-level military enlisted work.&#8221;  Which would include basic training, some sort of advanced/technical training, and then being observed on the job for some time.</p>
<p>This sequence typically allows you increasing amounts of freedom and latitude in managing yourself, your life, and your job, and could test for conscientiousness, as you describe.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s more than most people think &#8211; but also cheaper than college.  They live in barracks and eat food and wear clothes that are generally a lot <i>less</i> fancy/expensive than what college kids are consuming.</p>
<p>I guess you&#8217;re right that in the college example, they eventually pay back the loans &#8211; but you also get labor from the enlistee, probably at below-market rates (depending on the type of labor being done).</p>
<p>That said, if two years of military service was taken as seriously by the labor market as a bachelors degree is &#8211; you probably <i>could</i> get away with charging people for the privilege&#8230;.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not so sure on the less expensive front.  BDUs/ACUs/Whatever they&#8217;re calling it today are certainly less fancy than most college kids are wearing, but I doubt they&#8217;re cheaper.  IR camo pigments and flame resistance aren&#8217;t cheap.  As for food, you lose the fancy coffee, but pick up lots of processing on the field food.<br />
IIRC, average cost to the Navy is about $80-90k/yr for a typical crewman on a warship.  Junior enlisted ashore is probably a bit cheaper, but I&#8217;m going to guess at least $60k/yr.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&gt;make you learn very useful skills without explicitly teaching them (social skills, mostly)</p>
<p>I never understood when people said this.</p>
<p>Apparently no one learned social skills before school was invented?</p>
<p>And the way to learn social skills is to be isolated with a small group of children, all the same age as you, where you are not permitted to talk most of the time?</p>
<p>That seems like a recipe for <i>preventing</i> children from learning social skills.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It seems like this is a cost internalization problem. If employers make somewhat worse decisions on entry level hires, and then for subsequent-to-entry-level there&#8217;s the work history to look at for job performance (which should be better than even pretty good proxies like intelligence and conscientiousness) what&#8217;s the total cost in lost productivity? How does that compare to the signalling percent X costs of higher education (including opportunity costs)?</p>
<p>Assuming that the latter is considerably higher than the former, that means we have a market failure. We collectively would be better off in the situation where less resources were spent on education leading to somewhat worse decisions entry level hiring decisions &#8212; but we can&#8217;t get there because individual incentives aren&#8217;t aligned with the global optimum.</p>
<p>For those of us that aren&#8217;t libertarians such a market failure generally suggests some kind of government intervention is in order. However that intervention, at least at first, looks like reduced government involvement in the pro-education direction rather than government intervention in the anti-education direction. So, again at least at first, it looks like libertarians and technocratic liberals can on the same page. </p>
<p>The problem, of course, are the distributional consequences, which in this case consists the employers that are free riding and Big Education which benefits from the sweet, sweet signaling spending.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Who the hell learned social skills in school? You aren’t allowed to talk to anyone!</p></blockquote>
<p>Me.  When I moved into the gifted program, for the first time I was surrounded by people who were actually interesting to be around, and it did wonders for my social skills.  Regular school was a lot like being stuck in an environment where almost everyone is obsessed with reality TV and nobody at all cares about the same things you do.  Try going from that (where you don&#8217;t develop social skills because there&#8217;s no reason to) to here, but in-person, and see if it doesn&#8217;t help a lot.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t say what you did next. I would think there would be a lot of ways that the same sort of structure could be provided in an employment situation, or volunteer work, or the military, or &#8230;  . </p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Next, I enlisted in the military, and made basically zero friends.  Same thing when I left and entered the workforce.  Sure, I get along with a lot of co-workers, and some of them I get along with well enough to occasionally attend events with them outside of work, but this is relatively rare.  Never had anyone I&#8217;d be comfortable with, say, asking them to help me move.</p>
<p>And I think it would have been the same even if I went to college.  As soon as I had the freedom to spend my free time alone, that was the choice I made about 99% of the time.  So I can&#8217;t lay the groundwork to build the foundation of a solid friendship.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the fact that when I was in school, my alternative to being at school was not to hang out in a place of my own choosing optimized to suit my own needs &#8211; it was to stay at home in a cramped noisy house surrounded by my parents and siblings that I didn&#8217;t get along with well.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think it would be fairly remarkable if college, which wasn&#8217;t designed for the purpose of offering a fast, reliable and cost-effective means of verifying prospective workers&#8217; intelligence, conscientiousness and conformity, just happened to be the most practical system for that purpose. </p>
<p>A vetting system could be made much more cost-effective, at least, by setting participants to productive labor throughout the process which could generate value that would at least partially allow the system to pay for itself. And the costs could also be reduced by <i>not</i> placing people who&#8217;re responsible for producing publications which are at least theoretically intended to advance knowledge of their fields in charge of overseeing the work of the participants. If college is primarily a vetting process rather than a learning process, that&#8217;s a serious misallocation of human resources.</p>

<p>I regularly test at around the fifth percentile for conscientiousness and am not terribly conformist. I graduated with higher honors than anyone else in my department and year. </p>

<p>I work at a company that likes veterans for management positions. I don&#8217;t know whether they went to college, but preferring to hire veterans is a thing that happens, even outside government positions.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>He&#8217;s making the homeschooling error.</p>
<p>Homeschooling can work very well when a family has excellent social capital, income, and time to educate the child well through individual effort. And if you talk to homeschooling parents, usually these types of parents dominate the conversation, leading to a Lake Wobegon effect where somehow, all homeschoolers are above average. Generally the gifted and rich can overcome the inefficiencies of that model of education.</p>
<p>However homeschooling has huge potential to fail anyone who isn&#8217;t this. A lot of homeschoolers survive, but you don&#8217;t see the ones who essentially need to learn a basic high school education quick through remedial classes in college, or who simply can&#8217;t read or deal with advanced math. If the parents aren&#8217;t very motivated and wealthy, education becomes &#8220;take care of the younger kids&#8221; for girls, and &#8220;help dad work on his landscaping business&#8221; for boys.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why public education is so valuable, the ability to share risk and reduce parental burden in education is critical for an overall educated population. Caplan just looks at the best of the best and figures education is a waste for them, since they are smart and rich enough at the start not to need formal credentials. But it works so well for people otherwise; it prevents the burden for being educated for being absurdly high, even higher than student loan debts in terms of getting education done. Not everyone is a perfect self-starter and auto-didact.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Is there any good data on how much worse this problem is for homeschooled kids than public school kids?  It sure seems like a lot of public schooled kids get though 13 years of state-mandated education without learning all that much. </p>
<p>My half-serious proposal for this: if a student graduates high school and enters college, his high school gets a bill for half the tuition on any remedial level classes he needs to take.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s certainly not easy to disentangle the causes. If the student isn&#8217;t motivated, public school isn&#8217;t going to be terribly effective without parents who are pushing. Teachers can&#8217;t motivate every student. And if the parents are motivated and intelligent enough to be willing to homeschool, it&#8217;s quite likely the student, just by dint of genetics, was going to do alright in public school, barring, let&#8217;s call it, a strong peer effect.<br />
Homeschooling seems likely to have the biggest positive differential when the student is exceptionally good or the school exceptionally bad.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>If the parents aren’t very motivated and wealthy, education becomes “take care of the younger kids” for girls, and “help dad work on his landscaping business” for boys.</p></blockquote>
<p>The standard Amish pattern is version of this&#8211;help run a household for the girls, help run a farm for the boys. My impression is that it works, as judged by the ability of people brought up that way to run productive farms, start small businesses, in general function in the world despite the apparent handicap of extensive religious restrictions and the need to be bilingual.</p>
<p>Insofar as the essential skills taught in K-12 are reading and arithmetic, those are things most adults know and can help their children learn. Beyond that, in a world with books and the internet, kids are not dependent on their parents knowing things in order to learn them. And insofar as the real output is things like work habits, working&#8211;helping to run a household or a farm&#8211;should be at least as good a way of learning them as doing class assignments.</p>
<p>Is there data on output measures of home schooling vs public schooling? I have a vague memory of some old research on home schooling but don&#8217;t know if that was part of it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Just a clarifying note&#8211;that&#8217;s the standard pattern in addition to some formal schooling.</p>
<p>Typical Amish/Mennonite schools 20 years ago (there&#8217;s been some movement toward a longer day in the last few decades) had 3 hours of instruction/schoolwork a day, and a 120 day school year.  (Typically 8:00-12:00, with a half-hour of devotions and two 15-minute recesses.)  But that was all very focused work and instruction time: no class changes, no time getting everyone to calm down and work, no group projects.  After 8 years, the typical graduate can read and write English fluently (including older styles of English like the King James Bible), do arithmetic including fractions and decimals and units well in real-life situations, and will have some basic science vocabulary and techniques.  Those are the key goals and they are met.  Foreign languages, more than very basic science, and preparation for algebra are taught little if at all, but what is taught is taught very thoroughly.</p>
<p>I frequently joke that I&#8217;ve had less education than the average high school graduate, even though I have a college education.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I kind of think Caplan&#8217;s argument is itself wasted effort.  I&#8217;m not saying his arguments are wrong.  It just seems to me that they aren&#8217;t accepting reality enough.  I see that reality being &#8220;why are employers desiring university grads so much?&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think the problem exists in the education system as much as it exists in the employment system.  Managers, hiring managers, human resources etc seem to have a really hard time gauging competence and ability to do a job and are therefore deferring to a signalling system to help determine that competence.</p>
<p>For education to be a WASTE, as Caplan puts it, there has to be an easier way to determine competence.  What is that way?  Why aren&#8217;t we using it?  What does the efficient markets approach have to say about this?</p>

<p>I suspect you could judge competence about as well by taking a close look at high school performance, particularly in demanding courses, followed by a summer internship. The youngsters who took AP Calc, US History, English, and Physics and got 4s and 5s, and who did good work though a summer, are probably pretty much the same bunch who can get through college and do well. Assuming your entry level employees really don&#8217;t need any special skills, you could probably have saved them four years of effort by hiring them before college. </p>
<p>As for why employers don&#8217;t do this right now, the answer is probably that they don&#8217;t need to. We tell these youngsters they should go to college and subsidize them either as parents or taxpayers when they do, so they go. Employers may as well reap the benefits of the sorting we are doing at great personal and public expense.</p>
<p>And just to confuse the issue, many courses of study do teach at least some actually useful skills.</p>

<p>This is mostly equivalent to SAT, which effectively tests for intelligence.</p>
<blockquote><p>and who did good work though a summer</p></blockquote>
<p>This is closer to a conscientiousness and conformity test, but very short and not uniform, hence probably not very reliable.</p>
<blockquote><p>Employers may as well reap the benefits of the sorting we are doing at great personal and public expense.</p></blockquote>
<p>But at the end of the day these expenses are being paid by people&#8217;s salaries, which are paid by the employers.</p>
<p>An employer who figured out a quick magic test that substituted college could use it to scoop young employees before then entered college, undercutting other employers, these employees would be generally willing to start working immediately for the same starting wage of a college graduate or even a lower one, if they were to switch to a different employer later their work experience would more than make up for the lack of a degree. This looks like a win-win scenario for both employers and employees, do why doesn&#8217;t it happen? Probably because such test does not exist.</p>

<p>Yes, but in such a way that no individual person can readily exploit the inefficiency.  Even with a magic conscientiousness test.  Too many people are using the inefficient strategy, driving up wage prices generally.</p>

<p>This is less true than you might think.  Earlier in the tech boom it was more common for people to become programmers without a college degree, either by direct entry into companies who would hire such or through leaving a school and becoming part of a startup.  Even with experience, it was more difficult for these people to find jobs in other companies, because their resume would just be filtered out for lack of a degree.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Managers, hiring managers, human resources etc seem to have a really hard time gauging competence and ability to do a job and are therefore deferring to a signalling system to help determine that competence.</p></blockquote>
<p>Right. You see this in the tech field: what&#8217;s the best way to interview? Sample project? Pair programming? Whiteboarding? Toss out resumes without a kitted out Github? There are too many dimensions of personality and history to automate risk management in hiring processes.</p>
<p>Back in the day, unions provided certification and apprenticeships so employers could rely on communities of tradesmen to provide solid workers, but since the US has annihilated organized labor the closest thing we have to certification is higher education.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>There was a study linked in one of Scott&#8217;s articles in the last 2-3 months that goes into this. It covered all the major things people do use or could use for hiring purposes and gave them values for how much of the variance they could account for. A combination of an IQ test and an integrity test fared the best by far, with education and experience around a fifth as effective.</p>
<p>It was a pretty extensive effort and I really wish I could remember the link to it, but it&#8217;s out there, and hopefully someone here remembers it and had the foresight to bookmark it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&gt;For education to be a WASTE, as Caplan puts it, there has to be an easier way to determine competence. What is that way?</p>
<p>The signaling aspect of education really is providing economically useful information to employers about potential employees. Caplan admits that. The <i>waste</i> part comes in when the government uses tax payer money to pay for education.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say there are 100 people who want jobs, and 50 job openings. The employers want people who are intelligent, conscientious, and conformist, so they hire the 50 people who have high school diplomas.</p>
<p>The government sees this as an unemployment problem, and so pumps 2 million dollars into paying for education.</p>
<p>Afterwards, let&#8217;s say there is another round of hiring. There are 100 people who want jobs, and 50 job openings. The employers want people who are intelligent, conscientious, and conformist, so they hire the 50 people who have college degrees. The same number of jobs got filled by the same number of people. Where did the government&#8217;s 2 million dollars go?</p>
<p>If the government spent the money training doctors or something, maybe you could claim that the money was spent usefully, but suppose these were just clerk jobs, and they were filled by English majors. How do you feel now? Is this a wise use of taxpayer money?</p>
<p>Caplan says that an <i>individual</i> can&#8217;t unilaterally defect from the signaling system, but the <i>government</i>, with it&#8217;s bird&#8217;s eye view, can choose to waste less money on education.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The question is whether Caplan has proved too much.</p>
<p>Government pays almost all of the pecuniary cost of K-12, and it&#8217;s at east arguable that the wasted time of the kids is balanced, from the standpoint of the parents, by the babysitting function, at least for the younger kids. So the private cost is only what high school age kids could earn while doing things they found no more unpleasant than going to school. That&#8217;s a small fraction of the total cost, so even if the schooling is 80% waste, the government subsidy makes it privately rational.</p>
<p>But for college, while there are subsidies, most of the pecuniary cost is paid by the students or their parents as well as all of the cost of time spent by the students. So it&#8217;s hard to see how that can be privately rational if anything close to 80% of the time is a waste.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I guess the question is, for a new high school graduate, &#8220;Is there anything you can do with four years and $150,000 that will impress potential employers more than going to college and studying diligently?&#8221;</p>
<p>Off-hand, I can&#8217;t think of anything. </p>
<p>I suspect Paul Graham would tell you to get together with your smartest friends, build something useful, and try to sell it. You&#8217;ll probably fail, but even if you do, you&#8217;ll have learned more than you would have jumping through professors&#8217; hoops.</p>
<p>Sounds like a huge longshot to me.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&gt;“Is there anything you can do with four years and $150,000 that will impress potential employers more than going to college and studying diligently?”</p>
<p>Sure, you can pay employers to let you work for them.</p>
<p>I think in a completely free market we might actually see things like that: Early in their careers, people go into debt, paying big bucks for the right to work for a company, knowing that the experience gained there will allow them to move on to better jobs that pay more.</p>
<p>Since that&#8217;s not legal, we need some loophole that allows us to pay tons of money for the right to start working. Universities offer that loophole.</p>
<p>&gt;Probably depends on the field. I’d be a lot more likely to hire a 22-year-old that had spent the last four years working on a commercial software project (assuming a related skillset) than one that had spent the last four years earning a degree</p>
<p>When you say it like that, it&#8217;s not a bad idea, but suppose you&#8217;re an 18 year old trying to get started. How do you convince your first employer to hire you? You might end up as a 22 year old who just spent the past four years unsuccessfully trying to get their first gig.</p>
<p>Employers do not have a magical ability to detect diamonds in the rough.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s not like college is an especially good indicator of competence, either.  Making it through a four-year degree is evidence that you&#8217;re reasonably bright and good at following directions, but there&#8217;s some steep diminishing returns after that; most software companies have stopped asking for GPA, for example, since it turns out it&#8217;s a very poor predictor of performance in industry.</p>

In reality it would never get to a large scale. If it did somehow end up on a large scale, it would not pay off, and it would become less and less popular until it was no longer the cultural norm.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I should repeat that I don&#8217;t really believe this course of action is advisable, but to steelman it, what you are aiming for is the noble and enlightening failure.</p>
<p>You spent four years trying to understand a domain of customer need. And now you actually know it inside and out.</p>
<p>You spent four years trying to build a solution. And now you actually know pretty darn well how to build real stuff in that domain (software, perhaps?) and have a fairly impressive real product to show for it. </p>
<p>You spent maybe three years knocking on doors and persuading people to give you money. Now you have an impressive set of skills in generating leads, pitching solutions, and negotiating deliverables. Plus a bunch of useful contacts.</p>
<p>And all of this is more useful, and more indicative of effectiveness, than four years of assignments, essays, and exams. </p>
<p>Or so the story goes.</p>

<p>There also needs to be some sort of trusted way to verify that it is true.  As you said, there are probably a lot of people out there claiming to have done that very thing.  Some probably did, but many probably did dick all for four years and then thought &#8220;Gee, I better put SOMETHING on my resume &#8211; guess I&#8217;ll just tell them I tried to start my own business.  They&#8217;ll never know if I&#8217;m lying!&#8221;</p>

Maybe &#8220;my four high-school buddies and I struck out on our own to form a business&#8221; works for software, but in my own field, structural engineering, attempting that would mark you as a dangerous idiot.  I cannot overemphasize how important it is to work under somebody who knows what the hell they&#8217;re doing when you&#8217;re starting out.

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>For education to be a WASTE, as Caplan puts it, there has to be an easier way to determine competence. What is that way? Why aren’t we using it? What does the efficient markets approach have to say about this?</p></blockquote>
<p>Because it&#8217;s a coordination problem and the typical solution to coordination problems (government) is actually making it worse. The entire problem is that both students and employers are acting entirely rationally, but this behavior is wasteful in aggregate.</p>
<p>The reason government is making it worse is covered in Hanson&#8217;s latest book: politics isn&#8217;t about policy, etc.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>In chapter 2, Caplan considers whether the wage premium conferred by successful high school and college graduation can be justified by the knowledge conveyed. Basically, no. While some majors teach skills that are directly useful on the job, many do not. Also, people generally do not retain skills they don&#8217;t use regularly, and they have trouble applying something they learned in one context to a different one, so the idea of specific instruction conferring general knowledge and sophistication doesn&#8217;t work either. People remember what they were specifically taught, at best.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The highly educated are paid much better than those who are not. In chapter 3, Caplan addresses this education premium. The rewards of education are real: high school dropouts are paid 23% less than high school grads, college graduates are paid 73% more than high school grads, and those with master&#8217;s degrees are paid 122% more than high school grads. </p>
<p>He then tries to account for this education premium through other factors which tend to correlate with education, such as intelligence and socioeconomic background. Generally speaking, adjusting for these other facts lowers the education premium, but it never goes away completely. This is true particularly for vocational degrees such as electrical engineering, but is still true for degrees in archaeology and history, for instance, where the knowledge conveyed is not directly useful. So clearly colleges are doing something that makes their graduates particularly attractive to employers.</p>
<p>Caplan thinks that something is selection for the desirable qualities of intelligence, conscientiousness, and conformity. Later chapters elaborate on this claim.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s flat for me, as are all other regular polygons when I imagine them (except perhaps a 2-gon, which I think I usually imagine as a vertical line segment, and if I&#8217;m thinking about these things in the context of the complex numbers I&#8217;ll see them as points on the unit circle with a vertex on the right). Some other math visualization questions I&#8217;ve been curious about:</p>
<p>When you think about an integer, what comes to mind visually (if anything)? Does it vary based on any properties of the integer?</p>
<p>What mental image do you get when higher-dimensional objects are described (e.g. the unit tesseract, or the space R^4)? </p>
<p>What do you see when you think about &#8220;the rationals&#8221; as a set? Does it vary based on context?</p>
<p>I have my own answers to these questions but am not including them so as to leave people unbiased; probably don&#8217;t scroll down yet if you intend to answer and haven&#8217;t yet formulated a clear idea of your conceptions of these things. </p>
<p>These questions presume the existence of mental imagery, but I&#8217;d also be really curious to hear what people with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia" rel="nofollow">aphantasia</a> think about when they encounter these concepts; is it in any sort of sense that can be easily conveyed over text?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My hexagon is always flat side down by default, as are all the other regular polygons, and my 2-gons are horizontal too.</p>
<p>Something definitely comes to mind when I think of an integer but I&#8217;m not sure I could efficiently describe it. There are various fonts, background textures, and different colors involved. Maybe someday I&#8217;ll paint a few select integers exactly the way I visualize them by default.</p>
<p>I only know the tesseract, and I either think of Carl Sagan presenting it, or lately, the &#8220;tesseract&#8221; scene from &#8220;Interstellar&#8221;.</p>
<p>If you ask me to visualize the rationals as a set I think of two brackets with a few representative integers &amp; an ellipsis scribbled between them in my 10th grade math teacher&#8217;s handwriting, maybe also with his voice (or a voice like his) saying something to the effect of &#8220;let this be a set containing the rationals&#8221;.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>on integers: Mostly I&#8217;m pre-visual, or even straight up auditory (especially when I&#8217;m doing digit sum sequences it&#8217;s auditory and some standardized previsual manipulations akin to moving the digits around and morphing them into the new digits, but without visualizing said moving and morphing.  When I need/want to do the digit sums fast I drop the auditory.).  When I&#8217;m visual it&#8217;s the standard orthography.</p>
<p>on higher dimensions: Things like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtSNStVW81M" rel="nofollow">this</a> (note, while I am recreating the image on my own, it&#8217;s based on having seen animations like this before).  Two decades ago I tried visualizing 4+ dimensional space using colors and textures based upon the descriptions on a personal website by a person at some polytechnic.</p>
<p>on number series in general: I don&#8217;t visualize them.  I don&#8217;t know if this is because I&#8217;m not a set person, or for other reasons.  If I think enough about it I start recalling Disney&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJgkaU08VvY" rel="nofollow">Mathemagic land</a>.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m relatively unsophisticated mathematically, but maybe that&#8217;s still data you&#8217;re interested in.</p>
<p><i>When you think about an integer, what comes to mind visually (if anything)? Does it vary based on any properties of the integer?</i></p>
<p>The integer appears visually to me as an arabic numeral, with a kind of &#8216;faded out&#8217; space around it indicating its general position within other numbers of its magnitude &#8211; i.e. &#8216;7&#8217; would appear about 2/3 up in a sort of &#8216;grey space,&#8217; and &#8217;50&#8217; would appear in the middle of a &#8216;grey space.&#8217;  If I&#8217;m doing arithmetic this lets me do quick approximate math even with larger numbers; if I&#8217;m being more exact I&#8217;ll fixate on specific digits &#8211; i.e. if I&#8217;m doing math with &#8217;45&#8217; I&#8217;ll see the four to one side forming the scope of the 40&#8217;s with the 5 about in the middle of the range.</p>
<p><i>What mental image do you get when higher-dimensional objects are described (e.g. the unit tesseract, or the space R^4)?</i></p>
<p>Not sure what the &#8216;space R^4&#8217; is, but a tesseract sort of&#8230;slides off my mind.  I can bring to mind those 3d-rotational animations but they don&#8217;t make sense to me.  Intuitively I suppose I think of a cube within a cube or (irrationally) of a more complex 3d object, such as a dodecohedron with the points joined strangely.</p>
<p><i>What do you see when you think about “the rationals” as a set? Does it vary based on context?</i></p>
<p>I only think about rational numbers as a set when I&#8217;m also thinking about irrational numbers.  In that case I visualize them in a similar way as I do positive vs. negative numbers &#8211; after a &#8216;zero&#8217; point, things kinda go from black to white.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I have a math degree, just so you know my priors:</p>
<blockquote><p>When you think about an integer, what comes to mind visually (if anything)? Does it vary based on any properties of the integer?</p></blockquote>
<p>Generally no visualization, but a nonspecific impression of magnitude. -10^6 and +10^6 &#8220;feel&#8221; the same, basically.</p>
<blockquote><p>What mental image do you get when higher-dimensional objects are described (e.g. the unit tesseract, or the space R^4)?</p></blockquote>
<p>For the unit tesseract I picture an &#8220;unfolded&#8221; tesseract- ie, the four-armed three-dimensional cross model. For R^4 (and indeed, R^3 or other things perfectly normal to human experience), I picture an endless gray universe with no sense of dimensionality. When I work in it, I picture ordered quartets and an impression of euclidean distance, similar to my impression of the integers.</p>
<blockquote><p>What do you see when you think about “the rationals” as a set? Does it vary based on context?</p></blockquote>
<p>Without obvious context, I picture the popcorn function. With context, the picture will vary- which I think is ideal. Pretty silly if your model doesn&#8217;t change with context!</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Integers and rationals aren&#8217;t things I attempt to visualize.</p>
<p>Tesseracts are modeled in my brain as-is, and converted for visualization purpose into &#8220;cube with an additional dimension&#8221;; the best metaphor I can use to describe how this looks is to imagine a cube with a slider at the bottom, that can be dragged back and forth to change the color of the cube.  Except there is no slider, and the color doesn&#8217;t change, the cube just stops existing if you go too far in either direction.</p>
<p>(If I concentrate, I can generally set up four-dimensional scenes, by mapping the fourth dimension onto a time coordinate.  I can map fifth dimensional scenes by mapping the fifth dimension onto probability-space.  To get to six, I have to involve rotation-as-an-analogue-for-waves, and it requires that all interaction with the sixth dimension be mediated by motion.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Hexagons are flat side down, as are all polygons.</p>
<p>Thinking about a number just gets me a mental picture of that number.  Nothing special about it.  Thinking about integers in general gives me the mental image of a number line, probably because integer makes me think &#8220;positive or negative&#8221; as opposed to the natural numbers.</p>
<p>When I think about a tesseract I see <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Tesseract_no_vertices.svg/2000px-Tesseract_no_vertices.svg.png" rel="nofollow">the weird slanted-cube image</a>, or if I think a little harder I get an image of a bunch of cubes stuck together like building blocks, which is less accurate but a little more descriptive (since a tesseract has a cube on each side, like a cube has a square on each side).  The space R^4 makes me think of a set of grid axes, but with a fourth axis sticking out at a weird angle.</p>
<p>Thinking about &#8220;the rationals&#8221; makes me think about fractions.  No real mental image, just a number like &#8220;3/2&#8221;.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I have a degree in mathematics and one in CS.</p>
<p><i>When you first imagine a perfect hexagon, is it flat on the bottom, or is one of the points facing down?</i></p>
<p>It&#8217;s flat on the bottom, and I feel strongly about this.</p>
<p><i>When you think about an integer, what comes to mind visually (if anything)? Does it vary based on any properties of the integer?</i></p>
<p>If the integer has been specified, I generally picture its Arabic numeral and also say that number in my head. The &#8220;visualization&#8221; of the numeral has a location and maybe a size, but has no font or color. (It&#8217;s not gray or black; it has no color, nor does the nonexistent background.) If the integer hasn&#8217;t been specified, I don&#8217;t visualize much until something starts happening to it.</p>
<p><i>What mental image do you get when higher-dimensional objects are described (e.g. the unit tesseract, or the space R^4)?</i></p>
<p>I picture a tesseract as two cubes offset diagonally. R^4 is a big empty colorless featureless space. It looks just like R^3, but you&#8217;ll find that you can fit an extra orthogonal line in it.</p>
<p><i>What do you see when you think about “the rationals” as a set? Does it vary based on context?</i></p>
<p>I see a horizontal line with infinitely many points on/above it. I know the points are on the line, but picture them somewhat above. The rationals with smaller denominators are higher up, and when I zoom in I can start to see rationals with larger denominators separate from the line. This is all abstract, though: e.g. at no time could I count and tell you &#8220;how many&#8221; points I was &#8220;seeing&#8221;.</p>
<p><i>I’d also be really curious to hear what people with aphantasia think about when they encounter these concepts</i></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure whether I have aphantasia. When I visualize things, they have a shape (or at least an outline?) and a location, and I can rotate them about. But there&#8217;s no color (I can keep track of which thing has what color, but wouldn&#8217;t describe it as &#8220;seeing&#8221; that color). When I do algebraic manipulations, e.g. (x+y)(y+z)(x+z) = x^2(y+z) + y^2(x+z) + z^2(x + y) + 2xyz, the letters and numbers have a position but no color and no font. And there&#8217;s no background. I recognize people&#8217;s faces perfectly, but can&#8217;t picture them at all.</p>
<p>EDIT: When I did that algebra, I pictured this:</p>
<p><code>____x__x<br />
__+_____+<br />
y________z<br />
__y__+__z</code></p>
<p>(Ignore the underscores; I can&#8217;t figure out any other way to force WordPress to preserve spacing.)</p>
<p>with each of the sums circled, then looked for triangles with each corner on one side of one of the circled sums. I figured out that there were two kinds of triangles up to symmetry: 6 of the first kind and 2 of the second. I only needed to visualize 3-4 triangles before this became clear. And 6+2=8, which seemed like the right total number, so there was the answer.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Non-math person here, more of an artsy type.</p>
<p>The hexagon is flat side down.</p>
<p>Integers are a pretty neutral font, but I have very strong opinions about what &#8220;colors&#8221; they are, especially the first 10 or 20. Odd numbers are &#8220;warm&#8221; and even numbers are &#8220;cool.&#8221; </p>
<p>(A side note: that last part seems totally obvious to me, but a friend of mine in school who also had some synesthesia insisted that it was the opposite—that odd numbers were cool colors and evens were warm.)</p>
<p>I have a lot of trouble with the higher-dimensional stuff. I&#8217;ve always tried mental tricks to help myself &#8220;get&#8221; what they might look like, but it never really works.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ll be honest, when I hear &#8220;the rationals,&#8221; I just think that it would make a neat rock band name.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That&#8217;s interesting. I also associate colors with numbers but it has no relation to the parity of the numbers. However it&#8217;s based purely on the representation of the number as a string of digits &#8211; so, for instance, the number 314 is the same as the colors of the digits 3, 1, and 4 side by side (though overall it&#8217;s mostly 3-colored, that is to say blue, because more significant digits are given precedence). If I imagine the integer as a pure quantity, irrespective of the base I don&#8217;t really have a visual image, but if I imagine two at the same time then there&#8217;s a clear sense in which the greater one is further to the right even if there isn&#8217;t anything visually depicted there.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I probably have aphantasia and part of my research is in math. </p>
<p>I never visualize the objects you mention. If compelled to give some sort of graphic representation, all I see is a definition, i.e. k \in Z s.t. etc., or a field such that certain conditions holds. So in a sense it is text. But in general I just think about it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The hexagon is flat on the bottom for me, and the same goes for other polygons.</p>
<p>For the rational numbers, I have a sort of not-quite-visual concept of the dense order structure. Like, there are scattered points, but I am aware that if I look between the points I will find more points. This is different from real numbers which are in a straight line. Although since I&#8217;ve been reading about nonstandard analysis lately I&#8217;ve started to think of that line has having gaps in it too, where the infinitesimals should be.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have any imagery for single integers (for the set of the integers I would think of evenly-spaced marks on an infinitely long ruler).</p>
<p>Higher-dimensional objects&#8230; well, I don&#8217;t really know anything about them. Naively generalizing, a four-dimensional cube could presumably be thought of as an family of three-dimensional cubes parametrized by a real variable. So I have this picture of four or five cubes in a line in my mind, although that&#8217;s more of a selection of a few cross-sections than a visualization of the whole object.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Maybe David doesn&#8217;t have the mind&#8217;s eye? Or he has a really weird version of it? (See Scott&#8217;s earlier posts about this.)<br />
I think he&#8217;s saying that he&#8217;s picturing the hexagon lying flat on the ground. Of course, a person who actually visualized the scene would immediately understand &#8220;down&#8221; in terms of their (imaginary) visual field, so for a hexagon lying on the ground before them the &#8220;down&#8221; direction would be the direction towards themselves. David doesn&#8217;t seem the type to be willfully obtuse, so I think there&#8217;s a decent chance that he&#8217;s not actually visualizing it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&gt;Maybe David doesn’t have the mind’s eye? Or he has a really weird version of it? (See Scott’s earlier posts about this.)</p>
<p>Good point! That&#8217;s one of my favorite SSC articles and I didn&#8217;t think of it&#8230; </p>
<p>&gt;I think he’s saying that he’s picturing the hexagon lying flat on the ground.</p>
<p>Ah, so &#8220;down&#8221; would be out of the plane of the hexagon. That also makes sense.</p>
<p>I did not mean to imply anyone was being willfully obtuse, just a failure of imagination on my part&#8230;</p>

<p>On the other hand, thinking about it, I believe I visualize a triangle as equilateral, with one side down.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Thanks for replying! This makes sense. I think the way the question was asked caused me to assume &#8220;down&#8221; was in (or parallel to) the plane of my vision (I guess I&#8217;m assuming that I&#8217;m observing a plane?) but &#8220;looking down at it&#8221; is also entirely sensible interpretation.</p>
<p>And this whole thread has made me think I&#8217;m a much more visual thinker than I realized&#8230;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Generally flat on the bottom, but this time it was 3-D rotated toward the z-axis so the &#8220;bottom&#8221; was at an angle.  It also had a hexagonally-sided tube projecting behind it.  I believe the 3-D rotation might have occurred because I was still reading your sentence (scanning rightward with my eyes).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Tend to agree with this.  Not sure if this is universal, but the first time I learned about any shapes more complicated than &#8220;square, triangle, circle&#8221; was in kindergarten, and we learned by playing with these little wooden blocks of shapes &#8211; one of which was a hexagon, and yes, you sometimes stood it upright with the flat edge on the bottom.  Whenever I think of a hexagon I think of that little yellow block.</p>

<p>If the initial hexagon is point down, it has the property of like-a-hexagon, and tessellating hexagons form up around it accordingly.</p>
<p>If the initial hexagon is flat side down, it has the property of two-parallel-lines.  I then try to extend those lines to infinity by adding more hexagons, but the awkward extra jutty bits keep on getting in the way by overlapping with each other or causing gaps.</p>
<p>This is actually irritating enough to prompt me to actually stop lurking and post for the first time!</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Definitely the former, always, and picturing the point down takes noticeably more effort to fill out the whole picture (e.g. to include that there&#8217;s a point going upward also), whereas I picture the flat-on-the-bottom one completed from the get-go.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It takes an effort to pay attention to &#8220;down&#8221;, as it isn&#8217;t a natural category for mental imagery.</p>
<p>And it depends on what hexagon I am trying to visualize.  I might have a better answer if I hadn&#8217;t spent time writing a hexagonal coordinate system (a task which makes you acutely cognizant of the difference).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>char-rnn<br />
The simplified idea: you take a bunch of text and train a neural network to generate similar output (one character at a time).<br />
A better explanation (with great visualizations): <a rel="nofollow"href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/</a></p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s grab everything Scott&#8217;s written online (~3.5M words), throw it at a gpu for a day or two, and see what happens.</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s mostly babble, but occasionally funny. Here&#8217;s some output: <a rel="nofollow"href="https://pastebin.com/SZLSTLwu" rel="nofollow ugc">https://pastebin.com/SZLSTLwu</a></p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;m learning a new language and wanted a small project for practice. To that end, I made a twitter bot that posts a snippet once a day: @slatestarcodex2</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I always wondered if there was a way to get a char-rnn to babble on a specific topic. Like, train a RNN on a bunch of essays tagged by topic, flip it around and have it generate text from the topic. Wish I understood this stuff.</p>
<p>Know a good &#8220;I want to do cool things first and then understand why it works&#8221; style tutorial on ML? Everything I&#8217;ve seen is either &#8220;here are the magic buttons you press to make the magic library do things&#8221; or &#8220;okay, first thing you have to do is get a masters in math, come back when you&#8217;re done.&#8221; I prefer the programming-as-craft type stuff of &#8220;Okay, this is how you do this; got that?

<p>The agreed-upon convention seems to be to reply to the parent of the comment you want to actually reply to, and say @name or use the quote tags if it&#8217;s ambiguous who you&#8217;re talking to.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I gave this a shot as well. This time, I kept the html since you use it for formatting, and I wanted to see how it would be handled.<br />
Trained on the posts (~500K words) and comments (~1.1M words), so output is probably skewed a bit towards comments.<br />

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Because we needed an airfield there to support the drive into the Marshalls, IIRC.  The big Japanese bases (notably Truk and Rabaul) were bypassed because they were more trouble than they were worth to take, given that we could build bases that were 90+% as good on nearby islands that were a lot less heavily defended.  Manaus is the most obvious example.  Tarawa was also a rude wakeup call to how hard that kind of campaign could be, too.  I&#8217;m not sure when Truk and Rabaul were discarded as targets, but I think Truk at least was after Tarawa was taken.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>We needed the Marshalls to take the Marianas &#8211; Wikipedia claims Tarawa could cut off direct communications from Hawaii, but I&#8217;m not clear on why, since it is southeast of the Marshalls. Maybe it was too big of a base to leave in a position to harass the Marshalls campaign. But then Truk is smack between the Marshalls, Marianas, and Solomon Islands, so you think that would be more critical.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;d have to check Morison to be sure, but I don&#8217;t think Wiki is right on this.  The key realization of 1943-1944 was that so long as we could take bases and control the flow of supplies, we didn&#8217;t actually have to take the Japanese strongholds away from them.  But the bases were necessary to support the blockade and to help the onward advance.  Tarawa was taken because we needed one of those bases, not because of how much of a threat it was.  During the Marshalls campaign, it was important as a base for long-range photographic and bombing missions.  And those bombing missions, every couple of days, were important for keeping bypassed bases combat-ineffective after the initial carrier strikes.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Morison confirms that the Tarawa invasion was at least in large part done to get an airfield we could do surveillance of the Marshalls from.  The Japanese locked them down in the aftermath of WWI, and we had no idea what sort of forces they had there.</p>
