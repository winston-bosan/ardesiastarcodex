I should have been more careful with my phrasing. There are definitely lots of problems which mean that redistribution and identity politics don&#039;t have easy solutions. However, the last century or two of progress in combating racism and sexism have been mostly conflicts against people who didn&#039;t think the interests of minorities were very important. We&#039;re now reaching a time when the gains are a lot more marginal, and therefore maybe mistake theory is a better lens.

Same with redistribution: pumping more money into somewhat dyfunctional modern welfare systems probably should be analysed with mistake theory, but setting up a basic safety net in the first place was very much a conflict-based struggle.

Possibly the clearest conflict-theoretic examples today are international borders, which very effectively preserve the interests of citizens of wealthy countries.]]></description>

&#062;The result is some kind of horseshoe theory, where “mistake theorists” are basically centrists and “conflict theorists” are left/right-wing radicals. 


I don&#039;t know about that.    I know centerists who are primarily conflict theorists; they think that both Trump and far left radicals are fundamentally evil and destructive and that The People need to organize and fight and march and protest to win back power from both groups.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good article.

Personally by nature I&#039;m more a mistake theory person, but I have more and more become convinced that a significant group of people in our government today are simply not arguing in good faith, and that attempting to correct their mistakes is misguided because they already know the things they are saying are untrue, they just don&#039;t care because they are just trying to consolidate power and resources for their faction]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Example: dozens of studies over the last few decades have found evidence of hiring discrimination against blacks and Latinos in the US. Several studies specifically found that otherwise identical resumes which were “whitened” received more callbacks than resumes with black names (like Jamal or Leticia or whatever).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here&#039;s some analysis on how and why &lt;a href=&quot;http://datacolada.org/51&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;those results failed a replication&lt;/a&gt;. The upshot is that names don&#039;t only suggest race, they also strongly suggest other attributes such as age and socioeconomic status. To verify the claim that black names are discriminated against you&#039;d need to make some effort to ensure that the &quot;black&quot; names have similar non-race connotations as the &quot;white&quot; names.  Thus far, to the degree that this has been done, the results haven&#039;t panned out.

The old study which claimed to find anti-black bias had names like &lt;b&gt;Jamal and Lakisha&lt;/b&gt;; the newer study which did &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; find anti-black bias had names like &lt;b&gt;Darius, Malik, and Andre&lt;/b&gt;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/24/conflict-vs-mistake/#comment-594298&quot;&gt;neonwattagelimit&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I’ll use going to the bathroom as an example. It is not uncommon for workers in industry or retail to face restrictions on how frequently they can go to the bathroom, and for how much time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The typical example people have in mind for a limited-bathroom-break job is &lt;b&gt;assembly-line type factory work&lt;/b&gt;. Assembling electronics, processing chickens, anything along those lines. A problem with the usual analysis is that the people who bring up the issue have never &lt;i&gt;done&lt;/i&gt; assembly-line work or &lt;i&gt;thought carefully about how it works&lt;/i&gt;. So...

The productivity of an assembly line &lt;b&gt;depends on the fact that everyone on the line is doing a different specialized task at the same time&lt;/b&gt;. There is no substitute for this - it is the essence of what the job &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt;. If assembly-line workers could freely leave the line for a bathroom break whenever they want and take as long as they want with no consequences, whatever they are producing would be &lt;b&gt;vastly more expensive to produce&lt;/b&gt; causing the company to lose business to other, less flexible firms, which in turn would likely cause the employer to go broke and &lt;b&gt;fire all the workers&lt;/b&gt;.

I could explain why that is the case but as it&#039;s tedious to do so, let me instead provide an easier-to-understand and more-amusing example of the exact same dynamic. My counterexample is:

&lt;b&gt;A symphony orchestra.&lt;/b&gt;

A full symphony orchestra is a hundred specialized musicians on a stage. To perform a symphony they all have to be working &lt;b&gt;at the same time&lt;/b&gt;, each doing their part to keep their collective effort going, for the entirety of a particular, say, 2-hour shift.

The lead violin can&#039;t just get up and leave mid-concert to take a dump, because (a) nobody else can do their job quite as well as they can, (b) for them to be absent is detrimental to the work, (c) for them to leave and come back is disruptive to the other musicians - it could force other people to move, block line-of-sight to the conductor, cause people to lose their place on the page, and so on.

The only reasonable option here is for everybody to agree to poop *before* the show or hold it until *after* the show or plan other breaks *in advance* so as to not disrupt. This isn&#039;t because employers are unreasonably demanding, it&#039;s simply a fact of the universe that some tasks are done best by a group all working together, and a group can&#039;t all work together while various parts of it are off in the bathroom.

(You could &lt;i&gt;try&lt;/i&gt; to add understudies but the guy who understudies on timpani isn&#039;t a great piccolo player so you&#039;d need a hundred understudies, none of whom are &lt;i&gt;quite&lt;/i&gt; as great and well-practiced as the people being replaced...and what if the understudies need to poop too? Do &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; get understudies as well? If you need to crowd an &lt;i&gt;extra&lt;/i&gt; hundred musicians on the stage as spares the concert costs twice as much in salaries and extra chairs and they probably don&#039;t all fit...I don&#039;t really see a solution here. In practice, the solution is that some kinds of jobs are only for people who are capable of timing their bathroom breaks. People like that do exist; if you&#039;re not one of them you should probably do something else for a living.)]]></description>

What do you mean by saying that Marxism has turned into Leninism every time?  Democratic Socialist parties founded by Marxists have run countries without turning into Leninism, but one might argue but they&#039;re not Marxist anymore.  On the other hand, revolutionary Marxist parties, as far as I can tell, were always Leninist &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; they took over a country.  Some of the Latin American revolutions have been less explicitly ideological, but I haven&#039;t found any that were Marxist before they were Leninist.]]></description>
