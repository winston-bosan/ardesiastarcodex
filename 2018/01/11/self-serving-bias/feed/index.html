In regards to:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Federal and state governments aren’t the primary institution that controls (public) schools. The local (municipal) governments are.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Having been the Chair of a School Board for half a dozen years, I can attest that while some people may think this, it isn&#039;t really true in the U.S.
Outside a few specific local arrangements, municipal (i.e. city) governments have virtually nothing to do with running public schools.

Theoretically the Board of the School District does everything, but they tend to be severely bound by State law to minor budget allocations, approving capital expenses/borrowing and hiring the Superintendent.
Primary funding is controlled by State law, maybe a 10% difference could be made by a School Board&#039;s decisions. Funding from grants is controlled by Federal Regulation and what they will approve, pretty much forcing schools into cookie-cutter implementations if they want the grant money for things like technology.

State education law controls who you can hire, what you have to teach, how to teach it, right down to the number of hours in the school day. A local board may have a little wiggle room in creating policies, but when the Feds and the State require you to have a health polciy which includes vending machines and only allows X,Y and Z (to use one actual dumb example), there isn&#039;t a lot of control left to the local Board.

Bottom line, when the State legislature is in session, the local school boards pay close attention so they know how their schools are going to be required to be run differently that year. Local boards can influence specific hiring/discipline to a certain extent (as permitted or denied by State law) and the process of building a new school, but in terms of actual policy it&#039;s virtually impossible to deviate much from the &quot;standard&quot; ways of doing things because they are encoded as assumptions into the State laws and State/Federal regulations which actually govern everything.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/11/self-serving-bias/#comment-587668&quot;&gt;Wrong Species&lt;/a&gt;.

Depends how significant the cost of implementing the regulations is, either to the government (maybe they need to hire/train a bunch of new civil servants to implement the new regulations) or to the population affected (maybe all businesses need to buy a new widget to comply with the new regulations). Also depends how long it would take to see a significant positive/negative effect.

If everyone needs to shell out a bunch of money for wheelchair ramps because wheelchair ramps are mandatory, then they&#039;re probably going to be a lot grumpier about doing it if wheelchair ramps are only mandatory for the next twelve months. And probably drag their feet a lot more about getting the ramp set up, and be less concerned about it being a good quality ramp. So the net effect will be less good in a one-year implementation period than in the first year of an ongoing implementation, when everyone knows that they&#039;re going to need to make this work long-term. (And if you scrap the regulation after a year of people complaining about how hard it is to fit ramps to their buildings, everyone who *has* fitted a ramp has already paid for it and doesn&#039;t get that money back)

If you set a mandatory minimum level of exhaust emissions on vehicles in order to reduce air pollution, it&#039;s going to take a while for the effect to be measurable. Even if the improved air quality would balance out the inconvenience over a decade, the inconvenience will be concentrated in the first year and the air quality improvements will be gradual. 

The cost-benefit analyses for both will look different over a 1-year and a 10-year span, and if there&#039;s a significant chance it&#039;s going to go away in a year, people will look far more at the 1-year analysis.]]></description>

They&#039;re definitely not illegal and some people do have them, they&#039;re just not a massively popular thing.

The  lathe operator I&#039;m thinking off was mentioning this as part of a lathe intro safety course where he mentioned a few places he&#039;d worked that had braindead &quot;safety&quot; rules.  It was the employer that had those internal regs, they did indeed contradict basic good sense. Not USA so not OSHA.

Some old hands re: liquid nitrogen had some similar issues with badly written policies and regs that actually increased danger. 

An old crane operator I knew took great issue with the fact that there were 2 utterly contradictory set of rules for cranes in high winds, one of which, if followed, would lead to cranes falling over but for which you could theoretically get nailed for violation. 

If you can&#039;t think of a single poorly written rule/reg/policy in your field of expertise then typically spend longer in your field. Many such rules have good reason behind them.... some are the idle musings of someone who just thought it would be a good idea.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;I don’t think anything I said was more superior than the “lol euros can’t even medschool” in the original post.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There was no &quot;lol euros can&#039;t even medschool&quot; in the original post. What the original post said was that Europeans did medical education in a way that seems odd to Americans, with the implication in context that Americans would regard a proposal to do it that way as crazy, and Americans did did it in a way that would seem odd to europeans, presumably with the same implication.

You are responding to an insult that wasn&#039;t there.]]></description>

Did I say it was a matter of law? Do you think the disparity is unproblematic because it happens organically?

Also, @John Schilling:

I don&#039;t think anything I said was more superior than the &quot;lol euros can&#039;t even medschool&quot; in the original post. I get this kind of sneer from grey tribe medical dudes every week of every year, although I&#039;ve yet to see any evidence that we&#039;re really doing any worse.

Incidentally, most points on that list are direct analogues to common grey tribe talking points. I have a handful or two of HN types, HXDers, and transhumanists in my feed; I get a steady stream of reminders about how my home is a crapsack hellscape. (Been over to Chez Reynolds today? Hoo boy.) If you personally don&#039;t notice, it&#039;s for the same reason fish don&#039;t notice water. 

I admit that SSC is not exactly Helicopter Twitter (or HN, or D&#038;K) and that Scott is really not the problem (I&#039;m no Gerard) and I also admit that in this sense I probably vented in the wrong thread on the wrong site.

Regarding the alleged smugness, the thing besides healthcare that I get the most sneers about is criminal procedure, and the median grey position in this area has a few aspects that a few of us really do find disturbing (and irrational, both in the sense of &quot;gets bad results&quot; and in the sense of &quot;we would expect rationalists to oppose this&quot;). I&#039;m happy to discuss these if anyone&#039;s interested.]]></description>
