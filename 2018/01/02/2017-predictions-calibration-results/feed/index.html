					<description><![CDATA[I did extremely poorly on my own set of predictions (still can&#039;t publish them, they are riddled with bits and pieces private to people close to me, but they ended up 90%--&#062;71%, 80%--&#062;61%, 70%--&#062;50%, 60%--&#062;27%, 55%--&#062;80%), boiling down largely to two reasons:

1) poor conditionals. For example, I had thought to make some things relating to a book I&#039;m writing conditional on finishing the first draft of the book, but I had failed to make it conditional on that it would remain my primary project (because it seemed obvious to me that it would - and indeed, the reason that changed was pretty unusual). I grumbled and scored all of these as fails.

2) poor measurability! Sometimes I was trying to guess the state of things where I didn&#039;t realise I wouldn&#039;t actually be able to check it - e.g. I am so far removed from all politics at this point that it would take several hours of googling (more effort than I&#039;m willing to put into this) to determine if I was right, and I can&#039;t assess the financial well-being of a non-profit that I contribute to if they&#039;ve stopped talking about it. I shrugged and scored these as fails.

It was also impacted by me nearly dying of anxiety and depression in 2017, which I would not have guessed. On the upside I am now &lt;em&gt;pretty sure&lt;/em&gt; I have summer-SAD and can take this into account for my future predictions. (It also explains a lot of things that happened in previous years, including &lt;i&gt;&quot;oh. Oh. That is why my depression in 2015 just up and disappeared without warning when October rolled in,&quot;&lt;/i&gt; which previously confounded me to no end.)

This was my first year doing predictions like this. I strive to learn from the above mistakes and make more robust and measurable 2018 predictions. :D]]></description>

It&#039;s basically only for calibration. There are two scores, one for accuracy and one for calibration. A 50% prediction has no effect on the accuracy score, but the set of predictions at 50% can still affect the calibration score.]]></description>

That&#039;s why the 2018 predictions should come with a survey where SSC readers can give their own estimate. And perhaps we could also vote on our own questions for Scott to predict (maybe on the subreddit or something, so we can vote).]]></description>

@ Harry Maurice Johnston :

&lt;blockquote&gt;it is perfectly natural for an optimistic person to consistently phrase every prediction as “what they want to happen, 50%” rather than “what they don’t want to happen, 50%”. [Can’t take credit for this idea, someone mentioned it in another sub-thread.]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That was me, and I also said this calibrates optimism more than probability assessment as such.  (It sounds as if you might agree.)  Without analysing any of the predictions on an object level, and knowing only the method by which this person split the tie in 50% predictions and that far fewer than 50% of them came true, we can deduce that they&#039;re overly optimistic.]]></description>

@MostlyCredibleHulk, I broadly agree, but the current situation in Palestine would make even a person with reasonable expectations unhappy, and Yosarian2&#039;s claim as I understood it was basically that a situation like that is bound to be at least potentially unstable.  This seems reasonable to me, though I wouldn&#039;t care to debate the point too strongly.

PS: I may be misreading you, but you seem to want to argue the question of who the Palestinians should rationally blame for their unhappy situation?  I didn&#039;t think that was relevant to Yosarian2&#039;s claim, which is why I didn&#039;t mention it.

&lt;i&gt;EDIT:&lt;/i&gt; I want to make a joke here about it being a sovereign right not to need a balanced budget, something something Greece, something something Republican Tax Cuts.  Not the right time? :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/02/2017-predictions-calibration-results/#comment-584805&quot;&gt;Harry Maurice Johnston&lt;/a&gt;.

Sorry, too counter-intuitive for me.  The daily estimates are being made at different times, after all, and the way you round the probabilities (to the nearest 1%, 5%, 10%?) would affect which ones become part of the &quot;same prediction&quot;.

(It also seems wrong that you don&#039;t know whether a particular daily prediction will be part of the &quot;same prediction&quot; as another one until after you&#039;ve made them, though I&#039;m less sure about that.)

But even if we use your language, we still need to understand why it seems sensible to categorize the weather report for days 1, 3, 4, 9 and 15 as a single prediction but does not seem sensible to categorize someone&#039;s answers to questions 1, 3, 4, 9 and 15 as a single prediction.

I now think it has to do with the canonical form of the questions; there&#039;s an obvious relationship between &quot;will it rain on the 5th&quot; and &quot;will it rain on the 7th&quot;.

But to skip to a different example, imagine someone who is just generally overoptimistic and made predictions like this for 2017:

 * Israel and Palestine will sign a formal peace treaty, 50%

 * I&#039;m going to go to the gym every day, 50%

 * The EMDrive will be proven to work, 50%

 * No new reality shows on TV, 50%

 ... and so on, noting that it is perfectly natural for an optimistic person to consistently phrase every prediction as &quot;what they want to happen, 50%&quot; rather than &quot;what they don&#039;t want to happen, 50%&quot;.  [Can&#039;t take credit for this idea, someone mentioned it in another sub-thread.]

There&#039;s still a canonical form, but it&#039;s entirely inside the person&#039;s head, and I can&#039;t help but think that the differences between that person&#039;s estimates and the estimates a more detached person might make is also relevant.

I should add that I understand and agree that it is &lt;i&gt;possible&lt;/i&gt; for badly-calibrated 50% estimates to nonetheless look well-calibrated when analyzed in this way.  But it doesn&#039;t &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to happen, and I&#039;m still not convinced that either of us properly understand under what circumstances it should or should not be expected.]]></description>

They are allowed armed forces, those are just called &quot;police&quot;. And yes, the range of weaponry available to them is limited. So illegal groups, working frequently in tight cooperation with mainstream political leadership, doing whatever dirty work the political leadership can&#039;t do openly. Of course, there&#039;s also competing groups, like Hamas, which pretty much owns Gaza and has no lack of weaponry. 

And yes, Israel does tax collecting - one of the reasons being, most of decent jobs are in Israel and most of decent business is to be coming from the same place. As for withholding, the withholding usually happens when Palestinian side forgets to pay their debts, water, electricity, etc. bills, which reports conveniently forget to mention. Sometimes it also happens for political reasons - as it happened, for example, with Iranian assets in the US. 

As for what they want, the majority still wants Israel destroyed and the Jews to be gone (there&#039;s some controversy about where exactly, ranging from &quot;back to where they came from&quot; to &quot;under ground&quot; and &quot;into the sea&quot;, but the main premise - Judenfrei - holds). As long as that&#039;s the premise, they would never ever get what they want.]]></description>
