&lt;blockquote&gt;I had an Uber driver ask me if I could help explain to him how to buy Bitcoin.

I (falsely) told him I didn’t know anything about it. I’d like to think I saved the guy some money....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

How paternalistic--and kind. 

I think a story on &lt;I&gt;This American Life&lt;/i&gt; involved a guy making some spare cash as a telephone psychic. He would tell his callers that they were born under an unlucky star, so they should not bother investing in the lottery or risky investments, and always wear seat belts. Heck, if he&#039;s making up a story, why not make up a social useful story?]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Home purchases are not investment, they are consumption…. Owning a rental can be an investment….&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Oh, how foolish of me: I bought a house to live in. And my neighbor did likewise. 

But how fortunate that we live in a subdivision full of identical houses. I’ll simply sell my house to my neighbor and buy his. Now I can rent my house to him, and he can rent his house to me, and voila! We’ll magically transform our act of consumption into an act of investment--and we won’t even have to move!

Of course, when I was living in the house I owned, I was effectively renting the house to myself—with the benefit of receiving those (implied) revenues tax-free. Now that I’m renting the house I own to my neighbor, and vice versa, we each continue to enjoy the same housing benefits as before—but we get the pleasure of paying taxes on the revenues (net of expenses). And when we sell our houses, we won’t get the benefit of certain capital gains protections for homeowners. So, yeah, we may be poorer—but we can feel so much smarter for having made an &lt;I&gt;investment&lt;/I&gt; rather than merely engaging in &lt;i&gt;consumption&lt;/i&gt;.]]></description>

I follow a modified version of Taleb&#039;s investment portfolio strategy. 

First, I have a mortgage. 

Second, I have a pension. 

Third, I have an employed spouse.

Finally, I (and my spouse) invest some amount--a small share of our total assets--in the stock market. I suspect Taleb would conclude that we&#039;re under-exposed to risk, but that&#039;s the portfolio du jour.]]></description>

People misunderstand that incident. 

Yes, the author was furious--but not with the reviewer; with the wine selection. The author wasn&#039;t smashing an infuriating reviewer&#039;s head with a bottle of wine. Rather, he was smashing an infuriating bottle of wine on the nearest object. Just bad luck that the closest object was the book reviewer. 

Kinda a black swan incident, no?]]></description>

Disclaimer: I read &lt;I&gt;Thinking Fast and Slow&lt;/i&gt;, but not &lt;I&gt;Black Swan&lt;/i&gt;. 

The replication crisis notwithstanding, should Kahneman feel chagrin over this quote? 

Arguably the biggest conflict between Kahneman and Taleb’s work is Kahneman’s support for relying on making decisions based on fixed algorithms rather than making individualized, case-by-case judgments. As a guy who has won a Nobel Prize studying all the ways people make predictably erroneous judgments, it’s hardly surprising that Kahneman would encourage people to follow mechanisms that help them avoid such foreseeable errors. 

Arguably, one of Kahneman’s algorithms is to accept and internalize the lessons of cognitive bias research, even if it seems counter-intuitive. Taleb (and others here) point out that following this algorithm will lead to error. And they’re right. 

In contrast, according to Alexander, Taleb praises people who follow a more intuitive, less studied approach to decision-making. And doubtless this strategy will ALSO lead to error. 

So the question is, which path will lead to &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; error, and less &lt;/i&gt;drastic&lt;/I&gt; error? 

It may well be true that the “hot hand” research proved to be erroneous. And it may well be true that the latest revision to that research will itself be found to be erroneous. It’s turtles all the way down. Thus, I can’t see any more basis to condemn Kahneman for relying on the state-of-the-art research when he was writing than to condemn people who cite the LASTEST state-of-the-art research to challenge him. Both groups seem to be relying on the state-of-the-art research. This seems rational to me—even acknowledging that the state-of-the-art will change over time. 

Now, maybe people aren’t condemning Kahneman for relying on the then state-of-the-art research, but for his immoderate endorsement of that research. However, I don&#039;t understand Kahneman to be making an academic point, but a behavioral one. Kahneman’s point is that the nature of cognitive biases is that the conclusions will pretty much ALWAYS seem counter-intuitive; that’s the nature of a cognitive bias. So again, we must choose our algorithm: Do we accept and internalize the research, knowing both that the findings seem counter-intuitive &lt;I&gt;and may be wrong?&lt;/i&gt; Or do we subject the findings to our own intuitive analysis—knowing that this analysis will almost certainly lead us to conclude that the findings, whatever their merits in the abstract, do not apply to us because we’re far too clever to fall for such biases? 

In short, I surmise that Kahneman embraces a reliance on research the way Churchill embraces democracy: as the worst conceivable option—except for all the others. Where some might regard Kahneman’s statement as an expression of hubris, I read it as a statement of humility about the human condition: No one should regard him- or herself as above the influence of cognitive biases. He is Odysseus, exhorting us to bind ourselves to the mast so that we are not lured by the Siren&#039;s song to our predictable doom.]]></description>

I don&#039;t think this directly means what you imply, secondary properties are more susceptible to price declines than primary ones because you can default without losing your home and incurring all the extra costs that come with them.  It can be simultaneously true that subprime lending caused the problem but that the contagion was felt to a greater extent in a different sector.  This is a property (get it!) of leverage.]]></description>

Your link is misleading.  &quot;Even at the height of the housing boom subprime was only 20% of total borrowing&quot; but prior to 2002 subprime was never more than 5% of the market, phrasing it the first way de emphasizes the shift in borrowing which is what is criticized.

Secondly after the fact evaluations of repayment aren&#039;t that relevant.  The boom had two fairly distinct characteristics, the larger than usual share of subprime borrowers and the larger than usual share of adjustable rate borrowers.  ARMs accounted for about 30% of the market from 2004 through 2007, after being less than 15% from 2000 through 2003.  30 year mortgage rates from 2004 to 2007 were between 5.5 and 6.5%, 30 year rates from 2009 (when 5 year ARMS written in 2004 would either see a rate shift or a refinance) to the present day have mostly been between 3.5% and 5%.  This is a substantial decline in expected costs on these mortgages with some people getting a multi year 3 point rate reduction without actually having to pay refinancing fees.  These securities ended up paying out less than expected due to the extremely low interest rate environment that came with the crash.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/09/19/book-review-the-black-swan/#comment-670888&quot;&gt;baconbits9&lt;/a&gt;.

As promised: Septic shock.  Don&#039;t base your MCAT study sessions (or your investing decisions) on this.

The innate immune system has sentinel cells spread throughout the body.  If your toe gets a sliver with bacteria on it, the sentinel cells will release signaling molecules which a) tell immune system cells which are circulating in the bloodstream to stop and help, and b) tell the local blood vessel walls to get leaky.  Leaky blood vessel walls allow the immune system cells which are stopping to more easily exit the blood vessels and go into the affected tissue.  The toe gets red and angry-looking as blood leaks into it.  The immune system cells get to work destroying the infection.

This is a useful local response.  Events like this are typically independent and have no systemic effects.  An infected sliver in your toe makes your toe swell up; an infected scratch on your elbow makes your elbow swell up.

But... if a large number of bacteria escape into the bloodstream at once, and spread everywhere, the local response can become a global response.  All over the body, local blood vessels are signaled to get leaky.  Patches appear all over your skin that are red and angry-looking.  This leads to a drop in blood pressure.  The drop in blood pressure can be serious enough that organs get starved of oxygen and the heart freaks out.  25-50% of the time, death is the result.  A healthy local response becomes a systemic disaster.

There is a (very loose) analogy here to some types of financial panic.

If one bank suspects one company of fraud and refuses credit to it, it protects the overall economy.  It is a healthy immune response.  If all banks suspect a high risk of fraud everywhere and refuse credit to everyone, it crashes the economy.  It&#039;s septic shock.

&lt;i&gt;Manias, Panics and Crashes&lt;/i&gt; surveys a few centuries of systemic financial failures and proposes a model for some of them.  A new idea; then excitement; then exuberance.  Two things follow from exuberance: Credit expands as lenders get caught up in the exuberance; fraud expands as fraudsters take advantage of reduced scrutiny.  At some point, everybody wakes up to how much fraud has spread through the system.  Lenders realize that they don&#039;t know exactly where the fraud is, just that it could be anywhere.  They panic and stop lending to anyone.  The financial system freezes up.

The book was written in the 1970s, but it&#039;s an okay description of the 2000 tech bubble (remember Enron?) and a great description of 2008.  What was a Black Swan in the tulip market of the 1630s or the Panic of 1873 was no longer a Black Swan in 2008.

In other words, what happened in 2008 was already understood, at least in outline.  It was somewhere in step 2 of the progression in my previous comment: Multiple events observed, understood, loosely modeled.  Like an earthquake, we &lt;I&gt;know&lt;/I&gt; that increasing fraud and increasingly loose credit will put pressure on a financial system that will result in a disaster sooner or later.  We are not dealing with an unknown unknown anymore.

However, unlike septic shock, we can&#039;t get to step 3 with this particular type of credit-and-fraud-driven financial panic.  We can&#039;t explore the long tails with experiments on multiple copies of near-identical financial systems.  It&#039;s not a Black Swan, and it&#039;s not completely understood.  It&#039;s in between.

<p>As promised: Septic shock.  Don&#8217;t base your MCAT study sessions (or your investing decisions) on this.</p>
<p>The innate immune system has sentinel cells spread throughout the body.  If your toe gets a sliver with bacteria on it, the sentinel cells will release signaling molecules which a) tell immune system cells which are circulating in the bloodstream to stop and help, and b) tell the local blood vessel walls to get leaky.  Leaky blood vessel walls allow the immune system cells which are stopping to more easily exit the blood vessels and go into the affected tissue.  The toe gets red and angry-looking as blood leaks into it.  The immune system cells get to work destroying the infection.</p>
<p>This is a useful local response.  Events like this are typically independent and have no systemic effects.  An infected sliver in your toe makes your toe swell up; an infected scratch on your elbow makes your elbow swell up.</p>
<p>But&#8230; if a large number of bacteria escape into the bloodstream at once, and spread everywhere, the local response can become a global response.  All over the body, local blood vessels are signaled to get leaky.  Patches appear all over your skin that are red and angry-looking.  This leads to a drop in blood pressure.  The drop in blood pressure can be serious enough that organs get starved of oxygen and the heart freaks out.  25-50% of the time, death is the result.  A healthy local response becomes a systemic disaster.</p>
<p>There is a (very loose) analogy here to some types of financial panic.</p>
<p>If one bank suspects one company of fraud and refuses credit to it, it protects the overall economy.  It is a healthy immune response.  If all banks suspect a high risk of fraud everywhere and refuse credit to everyone, it crashes the economy.  It&#8217;s septic shock.</p>
<p><i>Manias, Panics and Crashes</i> surveys a few centuries of systemic financial failures and proposes a model for some of them.  A new idea; then excitement; then exuberance.  Two things follow from exuberance: Credit expands as lenders get caught up in the exuberance; fraud expands as fraudsters take advantage of reduced scrutiny.  At some point, everybody wakes up to how much fraud has spread through the system.  Lenders realize that they don&#8217;t know exactly where the fraud is, just that it could be anywhere.  They panic and stop lending to anyone.  The financial system freezes up.</p>
<p>The book was written in the 1970s, but it&#8217;s an okay description of the 2000 tech bubble (remember Enron?) and a great description of 2008.  What was a Black Swan in the tulip market of the 1630s or the Panic of 1873 was no longer a Black Swan in 2008.</p>
<p>In other words, what happened in 2008 was already understood, at least in outline.  It was somewhere in step 2 of the progression in my previous comment: Multiple events observed, understood, loosely modeled.  Like an earthquake, we <i>know</i> that increasing fraud and increasingly loose credit will put pressure on a financial system that will result in a disaster sooner or later.  We are not dealing with an unknown unknown anymore.</p>
<p>However, unlike septic shock, we can&#8217;t get to step 3 with this particular type of credit-and-fraud-driven financial panic.  We can&#8217;t explore the long tails with experiments on multiple copies of near-identical financial systems.  It&#8217;s not a Black Swan, and it&#8217;s not completely understood.  It&#8217;s in between.</p>
<p>Note that I&#8217;m not suggesting that we can eliminate all Black Swans.  That would be stupid.  There will always be more unknown unknowns.  However, we can sometimes convert what were Black Swans into partially-understood or, sometimes, well-understood phenomena.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/09/19/book-review-the-black-swan/#comment-670888&quot;&gt;baconbits9&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A Black Swan isn’t just tail risk, or an unlikely event. It is an out of sample event.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is an important point, and it leads to a follow-up point: Out-of-sample events can become sampled events.  Some Black Swans can be made tractable and well-modeled.

This has happened with plagues, earthquakes, and (your example) waves.  It has happened with heart attacks, septic shock, and a whole host of other medical conditions.  I&#039;ll talk more about septic shock below, since you can make interesting analogies out of it.

Scott is poking at the edges of this when he tries to figure out how medical theory (e.g. circulation of the blood, germ theory) fits into all this.  I&#039;d suggest that the transition from Black Swan to predictable event often goes something like this:

1. A lot more data gets collected about something.  Maybe this is because Greek and Phoenician traders encounter lots of different ideas and societies as they travel around the Mediterranean.  Maybe this is because the printing press makes it a lot cheaper to share data and build libraries.  Maybe it&#039;s because steamships make traveling around the globe a normal thing.  Maybe it&#039;s because people start cutting open bodies and carefully recording what&#039;s inside.  Maybe it&#039;s because medical schools begin keeping detailed records, and sharing them with other medical schools.  Maybe somebody invents a microscope.

2. People start noticing patterns in the data, and correlations between data.  They come up with theories, as we always do.  One person notes that when people sin more, earthquakes are more likely to happen; God must be punishing people.  Another person, with a lot more data, notes that earthquakes tend to happen in geographical clusters.  Someone invents the seismograph to track earthquakes, and they discover that little tiny earthquakes that nobody notices also happen a lot, and they often happen in the same geographical clusters where big earthquakes happen.  The theory of plate tectonics comes out of left field, and now we have a theory which ties together not just earthquakes but a bunch of other things, too.

For events which we can only observe and model, that&#039;s where it stops.  Earthquakes are in a weird space between Black Swan and predictable: We know why they happen, we know where they happen, but we don&#039;t know all the factors that lead to exactly where and exactly when.

But if we can do experiments on something, we can go on to:

3. We identify the probable causes for long-tail events, and we do lots of experiments where we purposely push parameters into the long-tail zone.  We subject a whole bunch of mice to infection, and we vary the conditions in lots of different ways, and we discover exactly what turns a simple scratch into septic shock.  Because we&#039;re not limited to observation, we can collect data at the long tails and figure out the exact shape of those long tails.  The body is a system which is subject to systemic failure, but because we can do experiments on many near-copies of a similar system, we can turn some Black Swans into well-understood events.

I&#039;ll have to make this a two-part comment, with the second part saved for after work, since I&#039;m ridiculously late already.]]></description>
