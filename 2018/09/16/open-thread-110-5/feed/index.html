The 100-hour X-3 test was pushed back to October.  And unfortunately, there&#039;s no vacuum chamber capable of testing it at its full 200 kW design power anywhere on Earth. 

I agree that building the Hermes by 2030 would be a stretch.  But so would building a Mars-capable BFR.  Elon is predicting 5 years for just a cislunar BFR, and his schedules always have to be understood as using Martian years.]]></description>

@ John Schilling:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The 1962-vintage RL-10 demonstrated twelve flights worth of reusability in the DC-X program, and that was nowhere near the limit despite having only a shoestring budget to do the necessary modifications. The next generation of the RL-10 is rated for fifty flights at 200 seconds each, and I’m pretty sure that’s still nowhere near the limit.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Yup, I called out BO for a reason - on many dimensions, I view New Sheppard as a successor to the DC-X. Will be interesting to see what they go with as an upper stage for New Armstrong. “We can’t imagine ever wanting to do more than N flights and rocket engine tests are expensive, so just test to N + margin and call it a day” definitely explains some of the behavior I&#039;ve seen, I appreciate the perspective.

&lt;blockquote&gt;But for a proper Mars ship, the chemical rockets are a secondary propulsion system in any event. You use them for about a km/s of delta-V on each departure burn, to exploit the Oberth effect, but the main propulsion is going to be a few megawatts’ worth of solar-powered ion or plasma thruster; we’re already testing 100 kW versions that could be clustered to provide the necessary power if we somehow can’t scale them up.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Last I checked, the X-3 was slated for its 100-hour test in April - do you know if that ever happened? (Apologies if the answer is in one of the papers on the linked page, I&#039;ll get around to reading them this weekend.) Between that and the planned VASIMR test, it does look like there&#039;s a lot of interesting stuff finally hitting TRL-5.

That said, I&#039;m still skeptical about manned electric propulsion happening anytime before 2030, certainly not before the first man on Mars. Same goes for most Cycler designs. Maybe I&#039;m just being overly cautious, but I distrust low-force systems in the absence of infrastructure on both ends of the trip.

...the &lt;i&gt;Hermes&lt;/i&gt; is pretty cool though.]]></description>

Yes, everything I can find that suggests 12p in the 18th or 19th century seems to be confused secondhand references to primary sources I can&#039;t easily obtain.  12p in 1109 seems pretty solid; I&#039;m guessing that it persisted on paper until 1699/1713, and the more careless writers missed the statutory update.

Hardly matters what the value is, if the judicial algorithm actually implemented is to subtract 1p from that value and say &quot;this is all we can prove was stolen, so petty larceny it is&quot; :&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;-)]]></description>

I liked d20 CoC&#039;s class system better than d20 Modern&#039;s.  It was clunky and shoehorned and didn&#039;t play well, but at least it tried to be a system and serve a purpose -- as best I can tell, d20 Modern had classes because d20 was expected to have classes and for no other reason.  Everything about it would have been better if they&#039;d just dropped the whole pretense.]]></description>

@John:

Thanks.

I was going on the 18th century situation, both because that&#039;s the period I know a good deal about and because that&#039;s the period of the &quot;bloody code&quot; which is usually described in this way. 

I&#039;m dubious about the claim that 12 pence persisted into the 19th century, given that it was 40 shillings in the 18th century. But it could have been the rule in the 12th century.]]></description>

The d20 CoC magic system was an attempt to square the circle and make a classless, casting-these-messes-you-up magic system for the d20 system. It actually worked pretty well, far better than the attempt to do a really simple class system so CoC could be played with classes and levels.]]></description>

Littering seems to be mostly a function of inadequate public trash cans, at least where I&#039;ve seen it. Either because people are unwilling to go look further when all three cans in sight are full, or because they just toss the stuff on top of a full bin and it blows out a minute or two later.]]></description>
