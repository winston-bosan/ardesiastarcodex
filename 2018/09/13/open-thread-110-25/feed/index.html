@ 10240

Thank you for engaging very constructively.  I wish you could just pick the specific program or rule or whatever you think is easiest to prove, rather than talking about &quot;affirmative action&quot; as if that was a thing with a definition we agree on, but you included some details that narrow it down somewhat so we&#039;ll do what we can.

&lt;blockquote&gt; As I said earlier, a lot of people seem to infer discrimination from outcome differences, without considering other possible causes (or giving them proper weight). Convincing them that another reason exist would decrease their estimate of the extent of discrimination against black people/women.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It&#039;s true that a lot of people infer discrimination from outcome differences, but a lot of people also infer discrimination where the outcome differences are unclear or unknowable, and it seems to me like you&#039;re really overestimating the extent to which anyone thinks about this numerically.  We can&#039;t quantify the effects of the things we definitely know affect outcomes (racism, poorer schools, incarcerated fathers, etc) and that hasn&#039;t stopped anyone from having strong opinions about whether or not the present level of affirmative action is correct; it seems like the race-IQ stuff would just change the talking points and not the positions.

You mentioned voting patterns changing, so you&#039;re not arguing that any particular politician would change their stance immediately, right?  It&#039;s not like Senator John Q. Republican will say, &quot;Hey, now that we know about this IQ stuff, I propose [insert anything here]&quot; and the Democrats will say, &quot;Sure, that&#039;s reasonable.&quot;  They can&#039;t even do that to fix bridges.  So I think what you mean is that the people in office will keep their present positions, but that, over the course of a decade or two, different people will replace them, and the anti-AA side will gain ground and some unspecified AA program will be abolished or reduced as a result, right?

That might happen, but you&#039;re making an awful lot of assumptions.  First, that voters really think about this stuff dispassionately, as opposed to voting by emotion and tribal affiliation.  Second, that the opinions of the voters substantially affect which laws pass, which does happen sometimes but certainly not reliably.  And third, possibly most importantly, has it occurred to you that there will likely be a significant amount of support on the left for the idea that the race-IQ stuff is a reason for &lt;i&gt;even more&lt;/i&gt; unequal treatment?  Doesn&#039;t the right complain a lot that, despite their rhetoric about opportunity, what the left really wants is just equality of outcome?  I don&#039;t think that accusation is without merit.

More generally, this is a good example of why I don&#039;t want answers that would happen a generation from now - they require so many assumptions that it&#039;s not much of a debate, just us stating contradictory sets of assumptions that are too speculative to argue about constructively.  Fortunately, the argument &quot;the courts would administer challenges to AA differently&quot; is very similar to the argument &quot;lawmakers would pass laws about AA differently&quot;, but with the benefit of not requiring us to see arbitrarily far in to the future, so let&#039;s move on to that.

&lt;blockquote&gt; If an employment test has disparate impact, and the company is not sure it can prove in court that it’s necessary for the job, but it is, then the company is often better off continuing using the test and lowering the standards for the underrepresented group... Indeed, not only some voters or political commentators think that a requirement of non-discrimination really implies a requirement of equal outcomes, but even courts often do when interpreting law. That, too, could change.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
This is starting to sound pretty persuasive, but it&#039;s not a slam dunk and it also sounds like a very small effect, and anyway I&#039;m not certain we&#039;re talking about the same thing, since disparate impact and affirmative action are related-but-separate things that you are conflating in a very casual way.  

Affirmative action, a la EO 11246, as I understand it, required a handful of big federal contractors to come up with a plan that says, in essence, &quot;Our mechanical engineering department is 1% black, but we looked at the numbers of graduating engineers and our applicant pool and we think we could get that to 3% in 5 years&quot; and submit it to the EEOC, who would then accept it or argue about it.  Bu the point of affirmative action was to remedy obvious and pervasive discrimination against minority candidates, which is way, way less common now than it was in the 50s, and I don&#039;t think that&#039;s really done any more except as a penalty for companies that have gotten caught discriminating in a large and pervasive way, which is rare.  I presume that those kinds of mandates are not what you mean, and you&#039;re using &quot;affirmative action&quot; to mean programs or rules that are designed to comply with the Civil Rights Act, right?

Disparate impact is a way of measuring compliance with the Civil Rights Act and related laws, and it does use a numerical ratio (protected class being hired at least 80% as often as majority class) as a rule of thumb to determine whether an accusation of discrimination has merit to be examined by the courts, which, to a lawsuit-phobic company might look like a quota.  And there might well, as you suggest, be some employers who want to administer some test that they don&#039;t think they can defend in court,  who therefore accepts minority candidates at a lower standard in an effort to not get sued, and you&#039;re saying they&#039;d change to accept fewer of those low-quality minority candidates.  Sounds reasonable!  But also, rather rare.

First, I think this is quite uncommon.  It&#039;s super common to administer what amounts to aptitude tests and not get sued, because it&#039;s super common for aptitude tests to be obviously relevant to the work being done.  Also, most of the private sector is immune to this because they don&#039;t have to hire people in a systematic way*, so, it seems like this is mostly limited to the civil service  (and to some related fields that use the same hiring criteria because they&#039;re so heavily regulated, like say, community college administrators).  Second, disparate impact cuts both ways.  Unlike affirmative action programs, it is just as illegal to unintentionally discriminate against the majority as the minority.  So we&#039;re not talking about the end of disparate impact, just an adjustment to the location of the line between &quot;too many minorities&quot; and &quot;too many majorities&quot;.

This is really long and I&#039;m doing a lot of assuming.  So I&#039;ll stop here and ask, is this more or less what you have in mind?  That, after the change described in the premise I suggested, the courts would change the ratio they use in deciding whether unintentional discrimination has occurred, on those occasions when someone sues an employer because the employer used the kind of IQ-like-but-not-provably-job-related test that in practice seems to be limited to a small subset of civil service jobs?  And presumably, after some time that change would ripple out to affect other jobseekers that are in a similar position to the ones who brought those kinds of lawsuits?  

*If this is not clear I can support it further but it&#039;s kind of convoluted and maybe unnecessary so I&#039;m skipping it for now.]]></description>

@AliceToBob

&lt;blockquote&gt;given the tone of your language, I suspect you’re more interested in a “gotcha” than in honestly considering the responses you’ve received from commenters here. I do not consider you to be acting charitably.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Uncharitable is &quot;Haha that answer&#039;s not good enough, so I&#039;m right and you&#039;re wrong.&quot;  Charitable is, &quot;Sorry, that&#039;s not quite what I&#039;m asking, let me explain and clarify&quot; which is what I did, and continue to do.  You can imagine what tone my voice might be taking and make assumptions thereon all you like, but the plain fact is that I&#039;m asking because I&#039;d like to know the answer.  Why else would I still be in a stale thread that&#039;s only being read by three people who are all convinced I&#039;m an asshole already?   Honestly, I&#039;m baffled by all this quibbling.  I know there&#039;s a ton of thought put into this on the right that I&#039;m unaware of, and I genuinely expected to get a bunch of responses that were really strong and hard-to-rebut that would, if not actually change my position in an obvious way, at least force me to grapple with uncomfortable truths.  I was not prepared for thirteen fucking rounds of restating the question.  It seems like people just hadn&#039;t really thought it out very far.  And isn&#039;t being forced to critically examine ideas sort of the point of the whole endeavor?

&lt;blockquote&gt; I can see a “dialed-back” affirmative-action policy eventually being implemented, but only after society comes to a second consensus on the question of “To what degree are racial IQ differences responsible for the disparate outcomes we seek to fix through affirmative-action policy?”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

First, &quot;I already answered this&quot; is the exact opposite of &quot;you&#039;re asking an unaswerable question.&quot;   Second, the reason I want something more specific than &quot;dialed back affirmative action&quot; is because it&#039;s just too ambiguous to respond to.  &quot;Affirmative action&quot; can refer to a lot of things, and &quot;dialed back&quot; could mean a lot of things.  Shall I make my own guesses about which specific programs you mean and how they would be dialed back, and then rebut those?  I feel like that would lead to me being told I&#039;m putting words in your mouth.  

At any rate, 10240 went in to somewhat more detail than you but in the same general direction so I&#039;ll just respond to him.  In the meantime, feel free to pick a particular program or rule or law or wharever and a particular way it would change, if you like.  I&#039;m not going to do it for you so you can respond, &quot;Haha, that&#039;s not what I meant, stop being so uncharitable!&quot;]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Some people will switch from supporting the disparate impact doctrine, affirmative action to opposing them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Which parts, in what way, and why? Throw me a bone here. What affirmative action program would someone stop supporting, and why? In what scenario would someone no longer consider disparate impact the right doctrine for the courts to apply, and why would they do that?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For many people, affirmative action in the form of discrimination in the favor blacks or women, and the disparate impact doctrine, have both upsides (compensating for discrimination in the traditional direction, and perhaps other injustices against blacks/women) and downsides (the possibility that discrimination against whites/men exceeds discrimination in the other direction, companies not being able to choose the best candidate, companies not being able to use tests that are relevant to the job if they are not sure they can prove this in court).

People who see both upsides and downsides decide whether to support these policies by weighing the upsides against the downsides. If we think discrimination and other forms of injustice against black people/women is pervasive and is the main cause of the outcome disparities we observe, that strengthens the pro-arguments; if we think the opposite, that strengthens the counterarguments.

As I said earlier, a lot of people seem to infer discrimination from outcome differences, without considering other possible causes (or giving them proper weight). Convincing them that another reason exist would decrease their estimate of the extent of discrimination against black people/women. (Of course there are other possible causes besides discrimination and innate differences, convincing them of those would work too.) Other people think that any outcome difference that has societal reasons constitutes injustice, as well as wasted talent, and we should expect companies to compensate for it (but not if the cause is innate). For any of these people, their support for affirmative action or the disparate impact doctrine would decrease, as the arguments for them would weaken and the arguments against would strengthen.

If a lot of people&#039;s support for affirmative action decreases, it&#039;s likely that many programs (perhaps not all) would be abolished, or reduced in extent. Which ones exactly? I&#039;m not an oracle. One bet would be ones companies engage in because they are de facto mandated/incentivized by law. These are not decided on exclusively by left-wingers: even a Republican president and congress haven&#039;t repealed or amended Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act or Executive Order 11246, presumably because they think they would lose more votes than they would gain by doing so. That calculation would change.

How does law incentivize discrimination against over-represented groups? If an employment test has disparate impact, and the company is not sure it can prove in court that it&#039;s necessary for the job, but it is, then the company is often better off continuing using the test and lowering the standards for the underrepresented group, rather than stopping using the test altogether.
Executive Order 11246 originally only requires non-discrimination, but administrative and judicial decisions have interpreted it as requiring numerical goals. While it&#039;s not specified how a government contractor must increase the employment of underrepresented groups, a company will resort to discrimination in their favor if other methods don&#039;t exist, don&#039;t work or are too costly.

Indeed, not only some voters or political commentators think that a requirement of non-discrimination really implies a requirement of equal outcomes, but even courts often do when interpreting law. That, too, could change.]]></description>

These are not decided on exclusively by left-wingers: even a Republican president and congress haven&#8217;t repealed or amended Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act or Executive Order 11246, presumably because they think they would lose more votes than they would gain by doing so. That calculation would change.</p>
<p>How does law incentivize discrimination against over-represented groups? If an employment test has disparate impact, and the company is not sure it can prove in court that it&#8217;s necessary for the job, but it is, then the company is often better off continuing using the test and lowering the standards for the underrepresented group, rather than stopping using the test altogether.<br />
Executive Order 11246 originally only requires non-discrimination, but administrative and judicial decisions have interpreted it as requiring numerical goals. While it&#8217;s not specified how a government contractor must increase the employment of underrepresented groups, a company will resort to discrimination in their favor if other methods don&#8217;t exist, don&#8217;t work or are too costly.</p>
<p>Indeed, not only some voters or political commentators think that a requirement of non-discrimination really implies a requirement of equal outcomes, but even courts often do when interpreting law. That, too, could change.</p>

@ dick

From you:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It’s the policy change that I’m after. You can’t predict long-term outcomes of policy changes, and neither can I, but you ought to be able to tell me what will initially happen.

Presumably some of those people just love bashing liberals, or have some other personal reason, but I’m (charitably, I thought) assuming that most people who argue this do so because there’s some policy or law or action that would change if they succeed. So what is it? Tell me the thing that’ll change as a result of your side winning the debate totally and in all ways...

Or, you can just admit that you believe whatever helps your side win. That is, as we’ve seen, an option.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From my response to you and then to Matt M.:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The question you’re posing seems set up to have no adequate answer. For many issues, the appropriate policy changes are unlikely to be known immediately.

Now that we know for a fact that racial IQ differences exist, to what extent to they play a role in disparate outcomes we observe? Studies and a lot of money would have to be thrown at the question before an answer and a potential policy change emerged.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;... I can see a “dialed-back” affirmative-action policy eventually being implemented, but only after society comes to a second consensus on the question of “To what degree are racial IQ differences responsible for the disparate outcomes we seek to fix through affirmative-action policy?&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To reiterate, providing the details of a policy change is not possible given the hypothetical you&#039;ve posed. And given the tone of your language, I suspect you&#039;re more interested in a ``gotcha&#039;&#039;  than in honestly considering the responses you&#039;ve received from commenters here. I do not consider you to be acting charitably.

So, I&#039;ve given my answer. That you&#039;re not satisfied is unfortunate, but it doesn&#039;t change my response.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;The question you’re posing seems set up to have no adequate answer. For many issues, the appropriate policy changes are unlikely to be known immediately...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It&#039;s the policy change that I&#039;m after.  You can&#039;t predict long-term outcomes of policy changes, and neither can I, but you ought to be able to tell me what will initially happen.  On what planet, in what universe, is it unfair to ask what your side hopes will happen when they win?

&lt;blockquote&gt;In your hypothetical, society has already reached consensus on the analogy to (1): racial IQ differences exist.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is the wrong analogy.  Our current position - &quot;We know various things affect IQ, but is race one of them?&quot; is analogous to &quot;We know various things affect cancer rates, but is smoking one of them?&quot;.  And the answer I&#039;m looking for, the thing that would happen if you convinced everyone that the answer is yes, would be &quot;People would smoke less.&quot;  See how easy this is?  That&#039;s all I&#039;m asking for, along with an explanation of how one leads to the other (if it&#039;s less obvious than &quot;...because they don&#039;t want cancer&quot;).

I don&#039;t think this is an unreasonable thing to ask for.  There seem to be a hell of a lot of people who think it&#039;s REALLY IMPORTANT that everyone admit the HARD TRUTH about racial IQ differences being genetic.  They argue it ad infinitum, quote The Bell Curve chapter and verse, and bring it up at the slightest provocation.  Steve Sailer has made a career out of it, such as it is.

If you want to draw lessons from Duke or Jackie, you apply a lot more leverage if you don&#039;t emphasize &quot;some accusations are false&quot; but rather &quot;look at how much resistance there was to calling what-we-now-know-were-obvious-fakes as fakes at the time.&quot; It&#039;s not that some One Fact was revealed and every right-thinking person switched from &quot;oh, of course it&#039;s real&quot; to &quot;well, &lt;b&gt;now&lt;/b&gt; I know it&#039;s fake, but I couldn&#039;t know without that One Fact.&quot;

Things that should have made people extremely doubtful about (if not completely disbelieving) the Duke and Jackie stories were revealed fairly early on in their development, but anyone pointing them out was attacked.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Prognostications about what will happen years in the future are technically a valid answer, but I feel like it’s kind of a stretch – you shouldn’t need to go that far or make assumptions that tenuous.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Might not &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; to, but I think that&#039;s what&#039;s being shot for here. 
The end of racism is being shot for &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; way because affirmative action, disparate impact, and similar are seen as backfiring: on the one hand more black kids get As, but on the other hand a black kid&#039;s A becomes worth less than a white kid&#039;s A to someone who only sees the grade and the race. 
Obviously grade inflation (and other credential inflation) isn&#039;t exclusive to race, but I think that&#039;s roughly the sentiment.]]></description>

Perhaps I phrased poorly.  I don&#039;t disagree with anything you just said.

Simply convincing people that IQ differences do exist will, as dick maintains, lead to very little action, if the other positions are not addressed.

In fact, I highly suspect that a lot of the people arguing &lt;i&gt;against&lt;/i&gt; differences in IQ don&#039;t really believe it (or maybe just don&#039;t really care), but rather, are fighting something like a preventative war against the other positions.  The intellectual equivalent of &quot;fight them over there so they don&#039;t fight us over here.&quot;  So long as enough people believe IQ differences &lt;i&gt;don&#039;t&lt;/I&gt; exist, we never have to even have the arguments about all the other stuff.]]></description>

@ Matt M.

&lt;blockquote&gt;If they’ve been convinced that blacks have lower IQs and that IQ tests are fair and objective and that IQ meaningfully correlates with just about every positive outcome etc, etc then racial pandering and all affirmative action is immediately abolished.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I disagree. People can agree that racial IQ differences exist, and that IQ tests are fair and meaningful, but then still argue that affirmative action is necessary to correct for environmental factors or discrimination.

Instead, I can see a ``dialed-back&#039;&#039; affirmative-action policy eventually being implemented, but only after society comes to a second consensus on the question of &lt;i&gt;&quot;To what degree are racial IQ differences responsible for the disparate outcomes we seek to fix through affirmative-action policy?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;.]]></description>
