I feel like I spend most of my life in the top-left corner. I would describe it more as &quot;uncertain optimism&quot; rather than &quot;hope&quot;.

From the inside, it looks like I&#039;m generally a very confident and optimistic person, but not about anything particular. I&#039;m an opportunist, but without an overarching life mission that I&#039;m dedicated to and confident in. My prior for trying out any new task is that I&#039;ll be good at it: I try new sports all the time, I learn languages, I&#039;m trying to draw etc. On the other hand, I quickly change my mind when disconfirming evidence comes: most of the things I try I suck at, but it doesn&#039;t upset me too much that I turned out to be terrible at basketball (because my hyperprior confidence in the positive prediction was low).]]></description>

Indeed. This strikes me as a rather extreme misunderstanding of the motivations behind self-harm. The pain incurred isn&#039;t on the &quot;harm&quot; side of the tradeoff at all; that&#039;s the *reward*. Why? I think that varies from person to person; perhaps it&#039;s a mechanism of processing intense emotions, or an avenue for control over a bodily experience. Regardless of why, self-harm is often for its own sake, not on account of &quot;random noise&quot; or &quot;for attention&quot; (the latter, in particular, is a common and nasty way of dismissing self-harm as unworthy of help).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;In that case, maybe self-harm is what happens when the “willingness to be harmed” lever is set so high that random noise, the chance of getting other people’s attention, or just passing the time presents some tiny reward, and your harm-for-reward tradeoff rate is so high that even that tiny reward is worth the harm.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This came off as typical minding to me.  I self-harm every once in a while and when I&#039;m in that state it&#039;s like the entire concept of &quot;good&quot; has changed to the point where I actively don&#039;t want to be happy.  I&#039;m sure the incentive of getting others&#039; attention is the cause of some self-harm but in my experience, thinking about it as if it&#039;s a normal functioning mind misses something key about the experience.]]></description>

Oh yeah, I keep wondering about that when I read these articles.

Especially regarding depression and self-esteem: maybe there is a direct link between low &quot;neurological confidence&quot; and low &quot;cognitive confidence&quot;, but if there is, it&#039;s not at all obvious to me besides in a &quot;these two concepts sound the same so they must be related&quot; way.]]></description>

So this is how good world and predictable world, desire and expectation are linked: via action? We expect our actions to make our world better and fulfill our desires or else we would have acted differently, and if it does not happen we feel let down and have low confidence in our predictions about what action to take to make things better for us?

Hm. It is pretty interesting that I went through all the comments and links in both of these posts, and never figured it is action that may be linking expectation and desire, predictable world and good world. And I am actually depressed. Wait, non-depressed people actually expect their actions matter? I just do whatever is expected of me and never expect my actions make me happier, I expect either a miracle will or nothing. I never really planned to win, I planned to fail but in a way that I cannot be blamed because I took all the socially expected actions to avoid it.

This sounds seriously interesting. How do non-depressed people expect their actions will make them happier? Let&#039;s make an inventory. From 3  to 12 years old my happiest moments were getting exciting toys as presents.  That depended on other people giving them to me, not on my actions. From about 12 to 36, it depended on trying to find a pretty  girlfriend, which depended on them, not me, as I asked a lot out but most rejected. Finally married now it seems how my evening goes depends on whether my wife and daugther are fighting when I am arriving at home or they are being angels to each other. Nothing seems to depend on me.

How do non-depressed people do things that make themselves happier that does not depend on other people?]]></description>

Thanks Andrew -- I had to look up &quot;tilt&quot; but it was worth it, found some interesting reading on the concept. I don&#039;t play serious poker but handling your frustrations certainly relates to playing the ponies and more serious life activities]]></description>

We rarely work directly on terminal goals, there are long goal-chains so after every outcome there is a new prediction, the interpretation of the outcome cannot be separated from the prediction of how closer I got to the terminal goal (which may not even be a conscious ine). This could explain the narrow band and perfectionism: unless things are going extremely well, the depressed person expects things will just go wrong next step in the chain. If I had 95% on a freshman test, gosh, I had 5% wrong, and this was an easy test, things will get harder and harder and when the tests are hard enough I will fail them and never get a job etc. etc. but if it is 100% then there can be still doubt about future performance but at least no current evidence that could be inflated into a mountain of worry. There is no EXCUSE for expecting things to go wrong in a later step.

When breaking a cup, AFAIK &quot;I can never do anything right&quot; is more common than &quot;I am so stupid&quot;. So it sounds like a prediction of future performance.

Do you know depressed humor? Yes, it exists. It&#039;s the Murphy&#039;s Law kind of things. Things that can go wrong, will. Things that cannot go wrong, still will. Ha ha. Situation Normal: All Fscked Up.]]></description>

This is what I experience during my depressive phases, as I explained in a comment above. I believe this is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypical_depression&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;atypical depression&lt;/a&gt;? But yes, it feels like low neural confidence in everything.

In fact, I have only rarely experienced what is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melancholic_depression&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;melancholic depression&lt;/a&gt;, which is what one usually thinks of when thinking of depression, which would explain why it took such a long time for me to connect the dots.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Scott,

I don&#039;t remember if I raised it before - there are two kinds of depression, A) where your ability to feel pleasure is numbed B) you can feel pleasure perfectly well but you are not motivated to seek it out.

That friend you had away from his computer to a party, and he enjoyed it, but next time you have to drag him again. He is just not making that sort of &quot;I like it, therefore I am gonna do it&quot; connection.

That is me. I don&#039;t see the world in grayscale. This seems to be common in my family. SSRI&#039;s don&#039;t really help, because maybe it is more dopamine-related.

Perhaps a more striking example, something you can identify easier with your patients. People like me feel the need to pee but not actually stand up and go. Just put up with it. I don&#039;t know why. Just because it is unpleasant it does not really mean I have to do something about it. 

Psychologically it could be some kind of a wrong thought like &quot;I don&#039;t deserve pleasure because I am guilty and bad&quot; or &quot;You have to pay for pleasure with future pain, better avoid it, and current pain is okay as you are paying some debt off and you will have less future pain&quot; or something of that sort but frankly I cannot even identify such thoughts in me. I don&#039;t really think I believe stuff like this consciously.

Another, perhaps related thing is always being somewhere else with thoughts and not being in the here and now. Meditation used to be very useful for this but currently meditation feels very hard to do.

In this model it woulds like now neural confidence but not big priors on bad outcomes. Except it is not actually anxiety, nor agitatedness. 

This is the first time I hear about behavioral activation but sounds like similar to what I prescribed to myself: try random things, random foods, music etc.]]></description>
