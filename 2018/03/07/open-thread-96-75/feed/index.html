So...I don&#039;t see how you&#039;re getting from &quot;this might be a negative in coming centuries&quot; to &quot;we should spend at least a trillion dollars now&quot;. Do you know what, specifically, we&#039;d be spending that trillion dollars &lt;b&gt;on&lt;/b&gt;? What&#039;s the strategy? Do you have a convincing story that this amount of spending spent the way you desire would do &lt;i&gt;enough&lt;/i&gt; to address the problem that we should expect &lt;i&gt;more than a trillion dollars of benefit&lt;/i&gt; to result?

If you &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; made such calculations: do they include an allowance for the expected cost of political rent-seeking?

I&#039;m sure I don&#039;t know the true cost of acidification, but I&#039;m pretty sure you don&#039;t either. Absent a specific accounting this all seems pretty pie-in-the-sky.

Matt Ridley notes that acidification &lt;i&gt;helps&lt;/i&gt; some sea organisms build shells and points to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027277140900537X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Vulnerability of marine biodiversity to ocean acidification: A meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://sci-hub.hk/10.1016/j.ecss.2009.11.022&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sci-hub link&lt;/a&gt;) for some of the relevant complexity. From the abstract:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Active biological processes and small-scale temporal and spatial variability in ocean pH may render marine biota far more resistant to ocean acidification than hitherto believed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

UPDATE: If (as per another comment) the main basis of &quot;we should spend a trillion bucks!&quot; is to preserve future fishing jobs, you might need to worry a bit about &lt;i&gt;discount rates&lt;/i&gt;.]]></description>

If you&#039;re bulking, you should aim for about 1g protein/day per lb of body weight. If 100g sounds like a lot, you&#039;re probably under-eating--I often get 100g just at dinner!  You don&#039;t need to make a sudden change, but you&#039;ll want to gradually start eating more. Think of eating as a skill you need to build up, just like the lifts themselves.

As the weights get heavier, you&#039;ll find that you&#039;re putting your body through incredible stress, and you need to eat a lot just to not die.  I personally had to add about 1000 calories/day to my diet when I did Starting Strength, and I was in my 30&#039;s so not exactly your fast-metabolism teenager.  You can reduce your calories later when you&#039;re on a slower program, but beginner programs like Starting Strength and StrongLifts are very aggressive.

You should be able to get your protein target easily with milk and meat.  Find some sauce for your chicken so you don&#039;t have to choke down dry chicken breasts.  Milk is an efficient way to add calories and protein, try adding a glass with every meal.  Whey protein is good for a post-workout protein infusion, but I&#039;d avoid relying on it too much because it runs through the system fast and will end up in the toilet if you take a lot.

Good luck with your gains.  You may be surprised just how quickly you can get results if you stick to the program.]]></description>

Yes, that&#039;s a good example. Since Aapje was being nasty and is frequently annoying, it was hard to continue ignoring him like I should have instead of taking the bait.]]></description>

I agree if the negative feedback isn&#039;t working it makes a lot more sense to expel, dispassionately if possible, then it does to have the person stick around and continue to get negative feedback that he either can&#039;t perceive or can&#039;t use to improve.

Being maximally compassionate is made more difficult by the fact that just because someone is disabled in some way doesn&#039;t necessarily mean he isn&#039;t also a jerk. When someone is nasty on top of being annoying that&#039;s a pretty repulsive combination.]]></description>

Pretty much all, except that nerds have been better than most at building societies without so much of that behavior, because nerds &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; those societies.
