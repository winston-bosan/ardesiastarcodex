I find it very expected to want to consult people you trust on all important decisions. After all, even if your thinking processes work correctly, you can be plainly mistaken in your reasoning. I would even go as far as to claim that if someone is completely certain about an important decision they haven&#039;t talked over with anyone, they&#039;re overconfident. I do not see why that shouldn&#039;t also apply to a decision to cease to exist.]]></description>

It could be either, depending on the hospital. ER charges vary widely.

My one trip to the ER as an adult (knock on wood) yielded a $2500 bill for roughly 10 minutes of contact.  I received an anesthetic injection that to get me through (most of) the night, until I could get to a dentist.

I suppose that if I were to agree to pay $15000/hour for medical attention, dental pain exacerbated by sinus infection would qualify. [/digression]

Of that, something like $1800 was a blanket &quot;intake&quot; fee.  The other $700 was split more or less evenly between &#039;supplies&#039;, the nurse who gave the shot, and the nurse&#039;s supervisor (probably for approving it). I had a high deductible plan at the time, and paid all $2500. I had hoped that the ER (a university hospital) would negotiate, but no. I didn&#039;t meet their standards for financial hardship.]]></description>

A 5150 in California is a bar to firearms possession.  I believe it&#039;s the similar PA 302 that was struck down as a Federal bar.  It doesn&#039;t matter whether it actually makes it to the system since they ask the question on the form; if you&#039;re up to no good, you might get away with lying, but if you&#039;re not up to no good you&#039;re risking prosecution for perjury if you do.

Besides, there&#039;s no bar for disqualifying conditions being added retroactively.  The ex post facto law provision is dead as long as the State is willing to pretend the restriction isn&#039;t punitive.]]></description>

Most traditional long-acting injectables have relied on a large injection into a muscle, from which the drug is slowly released over weeks. Depo-Provera is the same exact drug as its oral contraceptive equivalent, just way more and injected into a muscle. A lot of long-acting injectible antipsychotics couple the active molecule to some ester like haloperidol decanoate, which ensures slow release. Some are subsequently metabolized into the active drug.

The long-acting risperidone (and I think naltrexone) formulations are different, and rather interesting. They encapsulate the medicine in tiny spheres of biodegradable polymers like polyglactin, the same stuff used in absorbable sutures. The spheres slowly break down, releasing the active ingredient.]]></description>

Federally and in most states, &quot;involuntary commitment&quot; for the purposes of gun ownership is judicial commitment AFTER the initial hold, not the initial hold itself. Only a small fraction of people who have been initially committed ever make their way into the background check system, so it&#039;s largely moot anyway.

Some states do have additional restrictions that apply to firearms ownership after 72-hour holds, but these are likewise not consistently enforceable, and in at least one decision unconstitutional given the lack of due process.]]></description>

In the jurisdiction for our hospital, the court to challenge a 72-hour hold is only held on Wednesdays and Fridays, so the main issue is when the commitment is placed, with 72 hours being a floor. If a patient is held 73 hours before court, they can see a judge on time. If they come in on Wednesday afternoon, they could be held until the following Wednesday. So weekends sort of matter, though not the way you might think.

That said, only a fraction of people are committed to begin with, of which only a fraction don&#039;t get discharged relatively soon or sign in voluntary. Of those who do go to court, few are released (I&#039;m told this varies both by state and by hospital, as our state is relatively paternalistic and our hospital relatively selective with cases.) Thus, as Scott notes, the short length of stay caused by insurance is overwhelmingly the more relevant consideration.]]></description>

I&#039;m going to take a wild guess and say that you don&#039;t have an advance directive that covers most of the above scenarios, so how does that help? If you do, then I think most people would be happy to follow it assuming we can even tell which scenario applies. 

But for public policy terms, we&#039;re going to have to make a reasonable guess about what people would have wanted in advance or given the space to reflect etc. I don&#039;t see why the default should be assuming they wanted to die if their brain briefly enters a suicidal state.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt; As I said, my only point here is to call into question the dominant narrative of “If you go to a US hospital, you leave with six figures of debt”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I think it might be worth distinguishing between &quot;will leave with six figures of debt&quot; and &quot;might leave with six figures of debt.&quot;

Most people get what they need most of the time, as you say. Sometimes insurance won&#039;t pay. Crucially, sometimes you don&#039;t know whether it will or won&#039;t until it&#039;s too late. Any given medical expense *might* be ruinous. It probably won&#039;t be, but you don&#039;t know for sure when you have to make the call. This is not an okay position to be in.

I once ended up with a four thousand dollar medical bill because the insurance company refused to pay on a technicality -- six months after services had been rendered. At the time my annual income was around $12k.

Today I am on arthritis medication with a monthly retail price that is theoretically greater than my net income. For a long time I was terrified that a similar incident could drive me into bankruptcy at any time. It never actually &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt;, but the worry is still a nontrivial hit on one&#039;s quality of life.

(I eventually found out that, for this sort of medication, they won&#039;t even accept the order until after the insurance company pays. Lowered my blood pressure a good bit when someone told me that.)]]></description>

@Alwhite:

Your response would be a reasonable one if you had not previously written:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A “homicidal maniac” (doesn’t really exist)&lt;/blockquote&gt; For that to be false, homicidal maniacs don&#039;t have to be &quot;overly present in the homeless or mentally ill populations.&quot; They just have to exist.

And the way you put it makes no sense. A homicidal maniac is by definition mentally ill. Hence as long as there is at least one homicidal maniac, homicidal maniacs must be more common in the mentally ill population, since it includes all of them.]]></description>
