					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/03/11/ot97-dopen-thread/#comment-611207&quot;&gt;Barely matters&lt;/a&gt;.

3.  Yeah, there&#039;ll always be those people.  The strong point of a &#039;universal culture&#039; as Scott puts it is that by keeping those people in check we can all enjoy the benefits of a diversity of fringe cultural strengths.

It&#039;s a knee jerk reaction, and a poor one as far as I&#039;m concerned.  We&#039;re circling back around to the point we talked about earlier how &#039;science&#039; always gets it wrong until it eventually gets it right, and in any case where the outcome actually matters, people will be hurt by the mistake.  The answer isn&#039;t to lock down discussion to stop &#039;science&#039; from trying again, because the opposite of a mistake isn&#039;t likely to be correct either.

Imagine if we looked back and said &quot;You know, Medicine is just... always wrong.  Think of all the people who died due to treppaning people to release evil spirits.  Or how we tried to balance their humors and ended up bleeding them to death. Don&#039;t even get me started on electroshock therapy that&#039;s still practiced today! Horrible things have been done to people in the name of &quot;Medicine&quot;.  Anyone who wants to cut people open because they think it makes them better (Check out this fucking guy) is a sadist and needs to be stopped.  There&#039;s no way they can think they&#039;re right this time after being wrong so many times&quot;.

Now, the goofy part about this is it&#039;s not even wrong.  There are a ton of interesting examples of interventions that we&#039;re finding out now, might not actually be helping anyone at all.  Prehospital is my field, so that&#039;s where my examples come from, but for instance:  some services don&#039;t use rigid boards for spinal immobilization after trauma, and incredibly, their patient outcomes don&#039;t seem to suffer for it.  There is mounting evidence that Rapid Sequence Intubation, (Putting in a breathing tube before getting to the hospital.  I get the sense that you already know this, but just in case) doesn&#039;t actually lead to better rates of patients surviving to discharge, though it sure as hell helps the rates of survival to the hospital.

So even our modern medicine is wrong in ways that literally kill people despite our best efforts.  Just the same, tabooing even trying to get a better picture of what is going on because of those deaths is so much worse.

4.

Those all seem so easily dismissed though.  A and b are just &quot;This meritocracy isn&#039;t meritocracy enough&quot;, which isn&#039;t a fault with meritocracy, it&#039;s a fault with our current system.  And I would completely agree that those are problems that we need to solve for meritocracy to work.

c. is just nihilism.  Unless someone is at the point where they totally deny the existence of any value or utility at all, then &#039;merit&#039; can be defined in terms of whatever brings that value.  There not being a single, clearly defined measure of value that is preferred by all people doesn&#039;s stop the concept of people being rewarded commensurately for providing that subjective value. 

d. is dismal, but it&#039;s also the best possible case.  What is their alternative?  That power be vested in the incompetent so they can use it unwisely, so that when they fuck it up everyone can form teams and fight them out of power to replace them with other incompetents?  Even more people will suffer that way than in the worst case of an oppressive caste system!   Help me out here, because that seems flat out unhinged.

I agree with you that c is probably the worst here, because that just obfuscates things into complete chaos, which then creates a vacuum for power to fill however it wants.


This has been all over the place.  I&#039;ve had fun though.  Thanks.  Catch you on the next one.]]></description>

3. Well, some people outright say &quot;&lt;i&gt;we should be on top, because we&#039;re us, checkmate&lt;/i&gt;&quot; or have views that boil down to that. They usually don&#039;t extend to other people the same courtesy. I imagine they&#039;re the sort of people who think that cheating is OK if the ref doesn&#039;t see it, except when the other guy cheats and gets away with it. 

As for why it&#039;s witch territory, it&#039;s almost entirely a reaction to the bad shit that got done under the banner of &quot;science&quot; in various places - not just Germany - in the early-middle 20th century. It&#039;s not like people sat down and schemed to make it unacceptable. It&#039;s a pretty normal reaction. 

4. There&#039;s 4 arguments against meritocracy, or against justifying things as meritocracy:

a. &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;This isn&#039;t a meritocracy, but it could be - however, we&#039;re fooling ourselves if we think it is now, and pretending it is now is harmful&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
b. &lt;i&gt;&quot;This isn&#039;t a meritocracy, and it can&#039;t be, because the people on top, whoever they are, will always rig things and then say it&#039;s a fair game&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
c. &lt;i&gt;&quot;The very concept of meritocracy is offensive because you can&#039;t actually say anything has more merit than anything else&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
d. &lt;i&gt;&quot;Meritocracy is dangerous because if it works, it will result in a society where those on top truly are the most capable, able to completely dominate those below them&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

Most left-wingers today fall into b or c. d is what one finds in &lt;i&gt;The Rise of the Meritocracy&lt;/i&gt;, which I always shill hard here. I think a worrying tendency is the tendency to go to c the hardest. In general, I think it&#039;s bad that certain parts of academia and left-wing politics, especially a certain sort, have gotten more and more entwined: bad for academia and bad for the left. 

This has kind of drifted. Should we continue in 98.25?]]></description>

3. I&#039;m saying that the one leads to bad stuff, because it locks the movement into mandatory inconsistency and mental gymnastics to avoid doing bad stuff, (which I&#039;m also considering to be &#039;bad stuff&#039;)

I think on the other side that people don&#039;t need a reason to hate on historically hated groups, so they&#039;ll find a way in spite of whatever data is in front of them.  AichBeeDee can definitely lead to persecution jews coupled with different axoims. Like if instead of &quot;We need to hunt down privilege and level it&quot; they subscribed to &quot;They mentally outgun us, so we need to take them down now before they get a chance to definitively rule over us&quot;, then they could absolutely make antisemitic hay out of a positive group IQ difference.

I&#039;m saying that the people who think Blacks are less intelligent, and thus we should rule them, but Jews/Asians are more intelligent, thus we should destroy them are, aside from just being straight up self interested warmonger pricks, being just an inconsistent in their attempts to pick and choose winners and losers by fiat as the EssJays.

I place a lot more stock in internal consistency than I think most people do (It is my impression that the fans of SSC tend to do so as well, for good or for social suicide).

And to finish, this is not &quot;People think this is witch territory&quot;, it&#039;s &quot;This has *Intentionally* been made into witch territory so as to stifle conversation&quot;.  I&#039;m really not going to believe that this taboo is just some strange organic quirk that happened to fall together.



4. Yes, and I&#039;d heartily agree with you.  In all those cases where it can be convincingly shown, I&#039;m up for getting people out and leveling that shit.  If black people are being discriminated against for jobs by virtue of blackness alone, then let&#039;s break down that wall.  Likewise if women are getting overlooked because of their gender alone, we fix it.  I&#039;m also adamant about this.

But when they start moving up meta levels, and saying &quot;ok, a black person who is in all ways similar to a white is now treated equally or even slightly better off, but because fewer blacks perform to the same level, the standards are RACIST!&quot;, then count me out.  Anyone who says &quot;Meritocracy&quot; is a microaggression can fuck themselves.  At that point, they&#039;re not asking for equality, they&#039;re asking for special treatment and lower standards, to the detriment of anyone who relies on the service being provided.

I&#039;m even somewhat sympathetic to the idea that certain groups still have lingering disadvantages from past wrongs.  If we could come up with a plan to say &quot;Ok, this is how we&#039;re going to redress the problem, and then we&#039;re fucking even steven&quot;, I&#039;d be onboard.  As long as it&#039;s &quot;Just keep giving me stuff until I say stop&quot;, then I think we both know that it&#039;ll never be enough, because minorities are people, and people are shitheads when they&#039;re given blank cheques.

I think it actually is worse than &quot;I can&#039;t prove it...And look over there!&quot;, when it&#039;s usually done as &quot;I can&#039;t prove it, and fuck you you racist!  White men like you don&#039;t get to define what racism is!&quot; (I saw this exact argument put forward today on FB, and wished there were a &quot;Love this for the irony alone&quot; button)]]></description>

3. So, you&#039;re saying one will lead to bad stuff, and the other only leads to bad stuff because people think it&#039;s witch territory, leading to being full of witches? 

4. Well, I think that in a lot of cases, it&#039;s not incredibly hard to show that there&#039;s discrimination or whatever. Whether that&#039;s by statistics, or even by intellectually honest use of anecdotes (eg, let&#039;s say one of our hypothetical Appalachians has a story about getting treated badly because they&#039;re a Borderer. If they get hassled by cops, and know their Cavalier, Puritan, and Quaker buddies don&#039;t, even when otherwise they&#039;re behaving the same, that&#039;s at least a clue there&#039;s some anti-Borderer bias going on. If what they complain about is something that they and all their friends experience, it seems rather odd to ascribe it to that bias).

It&#039;s not a &quot;&lt;i&gt;well we can&#039;t prove this so LOOK OVER THERE&lt;/i&gt;&quot; situation. Part of it is an epistemic approach that comes out of social studies departments, some areas of philosophy, etc that devalues hard statistics and such. Part of it is that rhetorically being able to spit out a few dozen compelling stories, even if those stories are a teeny tiny drop in the bucket, beats being able to say &quot;&lt;i&gt;based on evidence, Borderer-Americans are 27% more likely than the average to be wrongfully convicted&lt;/i&gt;&quot; or whatever. Statistics get used as punctuation or for effect rather than in an enlightening manner. Of course, this second bit isn&#039;t just limited to the parts of the left we&#039;re talking about - &quot;anecdotes plus out of context statistics&quot; is incredibly common.]]></description>

Whether that&#8217;s by statistics, or even by intellectually honest use of anecdotes (eg, let&#8217;s say one of our hypothetical Appalachians has a story about getting treated badly because they&#8217;re a Borderer. If they get hassled by cops, and know their Cavalier, Puritan, and Quaker buddies don&#8217;t, even when otherwise they&#8217;re behaving the same, that&#8217;s at least a clue there&#8217;s some anti-Borderer bias going on. If what they complain about is something that they and all their friends experience, it seems rather odd to ascribe it to that bias).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a &#8220;<i>well we can&#8217;t prove this so LOOK OVER THERE</i>&#8221; situation. Part of it is an epistemic approach that comes out of social studies departments, some areas of philosophy, etc that devalues hard statistics and such. Part of it is that rhetorically being able to spit out a few dozen compelling stories, even if those stories are a teeny tiny drop in the bucket, beats being able to say &#8220;<i>based on evidence, Borderer-Americans are 27% more likely than the average to be wrongfully convicted</i>&#8221; or whatever. Statistics get used as punctuation or for effect rather than in an enlightening manner. Of course, this second bit isn&#8217;t just limited to the parts of the left we&#8217;re talking about &#8211; &#8220;anecdotes plus out of context statistics&#8221; is incredibly common.</p>

2. It&#039;s pretty hard.  We do what we can while trying to keep stock of our limits.

3.  I don&#039;t think that follows.  My stance is that of the people who believe in a) disparate impact (Ie, that differential outcomes are prima facie evidence of systemic oppression), b) that systemic oppression, defined as prejudice plus power, should be redressed through social and legal policy,  and c) that Jews have rates of achievement and occupy positions of power at some 15x the per capita rate of white men, all of them will either advocate for solutions we would consider antisemitic or are being unprincipled on at least one of these axes.  This doesn&#039;t seem to be a problem for most of the people who believe in a) and b), as I&#039;ve yet to meet one that can apply these in a principled way without arbitrarily picking and choosing winners.

Just because AichBeeDee provides a path to an internally consistent worldview that doesn&#039;t punish Jews (And Asians), doesn&#039;t mean it frequently does, as the people on the other side aren&#039;t terribly principled either.  It could also have to do with the fact that failure to denounce AichBeeDee fast enough has intentionally been made a thoughtcrime in much of society, so it&#039;s not entirely surprising that the people still willing to talk about it skew shitward.  Again, it&#039;s dirty pool to create a situation, and then use that situation as proof that creating it was justified.

4. The problem is then that the argument is completely circular, and only serves to further convince people who already agree with it.  I think there is prejudice and discrimination.  I do not think there is prejudice and discrimination fueling many of the problems where it is claimed.  If you want to claim that groups have an unfair lead, you have to go and actually convincingly show that.  You can&#039;t just assert it, and then claim that being asked to show it is part of the unfair system.  The answer to an unfalsifiable position isn&#039;t &#039;that&#039;s right&#039; or &#039;that&#039;s wrong&#039;, it&#039;s a recognition that we can&#039;t know until we devise a better test to falsify one way or the other.  

And when someone is arguing an unfalsifiable position, and saying that the solution is to just shut up and start giving them money and benefits until they tell you to stop, I&#039;m inclined to suspect something underhanded is going on.

This, I think, illustrates a sorta tragic but good sense part about life.  Ties go to the status quo, because we know that the status quo is viable (If not perfect, and definitely having some weaknesses).  If you want to change the status quo, you *Should* have to bring better than even justification, because this creates better outcomes than in the counterfactual where anyone can bust in with a just so story and and change things to benefit themselves at the expense of others.]]></description>

1. Outside of subtle situations like that, though, we&#039;ve got a long history of &quot;these people have stuff we can take/these people are trying to take our stuff; they must have failings past having nice takeable stuff/being jerks trying to take our stuff.&quot; 

2. Yeah, most people are unprincipled and inconsistent, and we all gotta be careful we aren&#039;t being. 

3. I&#039;m not saying that the truth or falsehood of a position has to do with the people holding it. I&#039;m saying that I don&#039;t think your position that aychbeedee provides a way to think about these things that doesn&#039;t lead to anti-Semitism reflects reality, because people who hold horrible banned discourse views tend to be more anti-Semitic than the norm. 

4. So, I think we need to break this down into two things. One is the position that boils down to &lt;i&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;you say it&#039;s a fair game, but it&#039;s not a fair game.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Like, say, playing Monopoly with someone who starts off with more money than you: even if the rules are fair - they aren&#039;t sneakily rerolling their dice or whatever - they&#039;ve still got an advantage. And if you start to suspect they&#039;re fudging with the dice... One way this position manifests is in its epistemology: &quot;let&#039;s have a reasoned, fair debate&quot; can be seen as something supported by people who have an advantage in reasoned, fair debate. Or, it can be seen as something supported by people who have an unfair lead and want to distract you, or are outright cheating, and want to snooker you. These are different worldviews, and I don&#039;t think one is so manifestly correct that the other can just be written off. 

On the other hand, there&#039;s the behaviour of rent-seekers who use that rhetoric to seek benefits for themselves like you see on campuses, among a lot of professional-activist types, etc. Imagine if all of a sudden America started thinking about the plight of poor Appalachian whites: not poor whites in general, but the mostly Borderer-descended poor Appalachian whites who can be regarded as having gotten a pretty shitty deal in a way that goes beyond &quot;they&#039;re poor&quot;. There would be a difference between poor Appalachian people saying &lt;i&gt;&quot;look, right now we can&#039;t compete fairly with you, because you&#039;re not being fair to us; we don&#039;t have the resources, you have a fair start, and when you say it&#039;s fair, that&#039;s bogus!&quot;&lt;/i&gt; and middle-class people of Appalachian or partial Appalachian descent busting into the college president&#039;s office screaming that they want ten million dollars right now to build an Appalachian Student Centre and they want expansions to the Appalachian Studies Program. Which, of course, will both mean some jobs for themselves, but probably won&#039;t do anything for the folks back in the hollers. 

I think there&#039;s a difference between saying &lt;i&gt;&quot;hey, this game is rigged, unrig the game!&quot;&lt;/i&gt; and trying to play the game underhanded yourself.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/03/11/ot97-dopen-thread/#comment-611207&quot;&gt;Barely matters&lt;/a&gt;.

Replies to quick thoughts in general.

1. There does have to be some proximity, you&#039;re right.  I think &quot;I want their stuff&quot; misses the mark to a degree, but it can happen that way.  I also don&#039;t think they&#039;re entirely ad hoc justifications.  A lot of it strikes me as being the outcome diminished social trust and cultural legibility, iterated over many interactions.  My own &#039;people&#039; are legible, and I have an idea of how to act, what is likely to make them happy or angry, what the local norms are.  When two cultures share space but don&#039;t understand one another, misunderstandings frequently turn hostile.  If I hold the door for you because that&#039;s a nice gesture in my culture, but I don&#039;t realize that in your culture holding the door implies &#039;you&#039;re too weak to do this yourself, also fuck your mother, swine!&#039;, and you rise to the insult, it&#039;s not going to take long before stories circulate and your culture gets a reputation for unpredictable violence.  From there it can become a self fulfilling prophecy.  Double that when there&#039;s a language barrier, and triple that when religion or other things people care very strongly about but can&#039;t be checked via empirical fact is involved.   

2. I think the groups are just unprincipled and inconsistent.  I don&#039;t think it&#039;s actually more complicated than people playing at ideals for effect, and maybe even believing them as long as they don&#039;t cost much to uphold, but then folding on them when they become inconvenient them and being exceptionally good at ignoring cognitive dissonance.  I find people, ideologues especially, get the most angry when you say something that provokes cognitive dissonance.  Way more than if you just said something counter to their view. 

3.  I can&#039;t say this strongly enough:  I really, really, REALLY don&#039;t care if bad people also think something that I think is correct.  It&#039;s enough of an alarm to double check your math and proceed with caution, but it&#039;s certainly not enough to change my mind about an idea in and of itself.  I think some absolutely awful people are big into consent culture, but I&#039;m not going to abandon it it just because they&#039;re reprehensible.  In my experience from people I&#039;ve spoken with, HB.D concepts are expressed by plenty of people who aren&#039;t in your horrible groups (Unless you make the argument completely circular and claim that holding those views at all makes one racist or otherwise horrible).

With that point in mind, I also don&#039;t think it&#039;s acceptable for groups to attempt to push ideas out of the overton window, and then complain that the people who hold the view are dirty rotten deplorables, which proves that the idea is bad in the first place.  Weren&#039;t we just talking about ad hoc justification?

I completely agree with you on multiple types of antisemitism, and even extend that dynamic to racism/sexism/otherisms, wherein the movements fighting against monsters end up becoming monsters themselves as we discussed earlier.  People just really suck at not abusing power.

4. I would not grant them a point here, because I think this ignores the bigger picture.  Politeness and rules is an imperfect system, but the other options are worse.  Ironically more than worse, they&#039;re exactly the systems the crit studies crowd are trying to fight, just with different groups of people holding the power.

By eschewing the system of rules and politeness, you&#039;re left with picking winners and losers.  And the way those are chosen is straight up bias of who the chooser prefers.  This alone should tell you that there&#039;s a game afoot.  One does not go to fight an opponent they think is more capable of inflicting damage undermining the restrictions on causing damage.  Iraq isn&#039;t going to the UN saying &quot;And you know what?  Even if we don&#039;t have them, we think nuclear armed countries *should* be able to throw them around wherever they want!&quot;, and if they did, I would be really suspicious about hidden centrifuges deep in caves.

The fact that this group is arguing to replace a system of rules with a system of fiat, tells us that they expect to be the ones with the power to make the choices.  If I replace &quot;received wisdom&quot; with &quot;Whoever is more charismatic and has the support of more powerful people&quot; then I&#039;m with you.

The sad reality as I see it, is that a lot of the grievance studies crowd doesn&#039;t have a whole lot going for them, and know that if they play by the rules they&#039;ll be outcompeted hard and wind up as 40 year old baristas with PhD&#039;s. Which understandably doesn&#039;t give them much incentive to play fair.  When it comes down to it, the rust belt Trump supporting factory deplorables and career acedemics who can&#039;t make tenure have pretty similar job and life prospects unless they can &quot;change the system&quot;.  The factors jobs aren&#039;t coming back, and no one wants to hire someone with a degree in critical race studies (And there sure aren&#039;t enough professor positions for every lifetime academic).  So I can see why they would prefer to burn it all to the ground, rather than just suck quietly, but it doesn&#039;t mean I support either of them doing so.

&quot;If we play fair I can&#039;t win!&quot; is a shitty justification in any context I can think of.  Even if they go one step meta and yell &quot;I&#039;m not cheating, YOU&#039;RE cheating!&quot; as they flout the rules.]]></description>

Just quick thoughts in general. 

1. There still has to be some sort of proximity. Tell the English back in the middle ages about the Japanese, or vice versa, and what hoot do they give? Move it up to the 30s, and all of a sudden they&#039;re butting up against each other. My point is that concepts of racial difference/supremacy are usually ad hoc explanations to justify the way things are in a society, the nasty stuff we want to do to other people, etc. It doesn&#039;t go &lt;i&gt;&quot;these people are inferior, so it&#039;s OK to take their stuff&quot;&lt;/i&gt;, it goes &quot;&lt;i&gt;these people have stuff we want that we&#039;re pretty sure we can take, so, they&#039;re inferior&quot;&lt;/i&gt;. Just world fallacy. 

2. Power relations in society are really complicated and we all want to make them easy to understand. Everyone gets confused when it&#039;s not easy to understand. Every now and then you have a situation where the polarities flip, or where there&#039;s massive inconsistency: eg, the Woke know that accusations by white women against black men in the Jim Crow South were all fake, but an accusation by a white woman against a black man now must be believed, right? Meanwhile, that same case will be where American right-wingers all of a sudden give a hoot and a half about black guys getting due process. 

3. What you&#039;re saying still doesn&#039;t explain that horrible banned discourse and anti-Semitism seem pretty tight. Sure, it&#039;s a different kind of anti-Semitism from the late 19th/early 20th century kind that lives on among some neo-Nazi types - the horrible banned discourse anti-Semites have dropped the dissonance-inducing &lt;i&gt;&quot;they&#039;re inferior so how are they pulling the strings?&quot;&lt;/i&gt; But they still think there&#039;s some kind of conspiracy or something similar - it&#039;s become &quot;&lt;i&gt;these people are superior and pull the strings but they don&#039;t want to admit it/they&#039;re lying to themselves about it&lt;/i&gt;&quot;. 

I think it&#039;s entirely plausible we&#039;ll see two strong anti-Semitisms at the same time: one horrible banned discourse as described, one left-wing &lt;i&gt;&quot;they say their disproportionate presence in rich powerful groups is due to studying hard and other positive values, but really they&#039;ve rigged the game&lt;/i&gt;&quot;. 

4. I think that this ties into 2 - the epistemology of the critical studies crowd, they might have a point there. &lt;i&gt;&quot;Play by the rules, let&#039;s be polite, let&#039;s discuss this rationally&quot; &lt;/i&gt;can be pretty sleazy if it&#039;s said by someone who just picked your pocket. There&#039;s clear cases where people purporting to be objective and so forth weren&#039;t; often they were fooling themselves too. That said, a focus on anecdotal evidence (&quot;lived experience&quot;) runs into the problem that if you poll American Christians they&#039;ll often say &lt;i&gt;they&#039;re &lt;/i&gt;more oppressed than Muslims, or American white people they&#039;ll often say &lt;i&gt;they&#039;re&lt;/i&gt; more discriminated against than black people. Both of which claims, when you look at statistics and so on, are on the whole bunk. But how do you know whose anecdotes to listen to? The &quot;lived experience&quot; model seems to rely on received wisdom to figure out whose anecdotes are true and whose anecdotes are bogus. This seems significantly less effective than looking at the statistics, because duelling statistics is easier to resolve than duelling received wisdom. But I can still see where they&#039;re coming from.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/03/11/ot97-dopen-thread/#comment-611207&quot;&gt;Barely matters&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;First, why do people hate the other tribe? Because they have stuff we want to take, or we have stuff they want to take, or vice versa.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I don&#039;t think it even requires that.  My understanding of the Robber&#039;s Cave experiment is that it demonstrates that all you really need for groups to hate each other is to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.age-of-the-sage.org/psychology/social/sherif_robbers_cave_experiment.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;vaguely aware that the other group exists&lt;/a&gt;

It seems like this works with any identifier, intentional or innate, and race is just one of those that is extremely hard to change or fake (For most people)

&lt;blockquote&gt;Go back enough and you’ll see people saying “English race”, “French race”, etc; you won’t see the more recent conception of there being three or four or five races.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All I see there is the priorities changing, complete with all the humanity of weird alliances of convenience.  If aliens were to attack tomorrow, I&#039;d fully expect that you&#039;re right and we&#039;d all pull it together and be a globally unified community to fight them off.  And then as soon as the last xeno was thoroughly liquefied, the old feuds would come roaring back.  If it&#039;s not these races, it&#039;s more specific gradations.  If it&#039;s not at the national level, it can be warring city states.  If the community isn&#039;t large enough to support cities, families can feud for generations in exactly the same way.  I think this is an innate human tic of conflict with whoever we define as &#039;other&#039; today.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Usually the cultural explanation is the one: the logic goes “a group that’s successful but not the majority must have a culture that helps them out, because they don’t have the ability to rig the game in the same way that the majority can.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two things here.  First, I think this stance completely ignores how centralized and top down power is today.  With government and corporate structure coming down from the top as it does, it doesn&#039;t take very many people in the right positions to dominate.  See South Africa for a good example, while thinking about the adage &quot;Give me control the money of a country and I care not who makes its laws.&quot;.

Secondly if we are going to stick to the line that having good culture that results in systemic advantage is only bad if one is the majority, independently of whether they occupy a disproportionate share of the top positions, why does this flip so easily when we start talking about misogyny/misandry?  Men are clearly not a majority of the population, being a hair under 50% by their 20&#039;s, and less to whatever extent we think the nonbinary crowd comprises more than a rounding error.  If we&#039;re talking about tails wagging dogs, it seems really convenient to equivocate back and forth as we feel like.  White men Men are valid targets for oppressor status, despite being only ~31% of the US population because they hold disproportionate power, and 1/3 is enough to rig the game.  Jews aren&#039;t, they clearly hold even more disproportionate amounts of power but they&#039;re not the majority.  And to be clear, I don&#039;t think either group deserves oppressor status.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I also think you’re wrong assuming that people on the left can’t do the sort of typographic-symbol based stuff. There’s a history of left-wing anti-Zionism shading really easily into anti-Semitism&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Oh, I didn&#039;t mean to give them impression that I think people on the left are immune here.  Completely the opposite.  To reiterate, I think that acceptance of Jewish achievement without HB.D as an explanation practically requires antisemitism when coupled with notions of disparate impact and aggressive privilege theory.  I&#039;m not surprised at all that universities are starting to clash with Israel more and more.


&lt;blockquote&gt;Noted reliable source Wikipedia defines “bad faith” as

    double mindedness or double heartedness in duplicity, fraud, or deception.[1] It may involve intentional deceit of others, or self-deception.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Well by that definition I&#039;ve been using the term completely wrong then!

So in the example I gave of treating one&#039;s interlocutor as an enemy to be destroyed by hook or by crook, it would only be bad faith if there were a pretense of civil discussion.  Which I can see how I would make that error, being that this is the case in virtually all the places I&#039;ve seen claims of bad faith applied.  Today I Learned.]]></description>
