It seems like we&#039;re going to break something important here no matter what.

Yeah, it&#039;s not &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; the same.

Death camp: You have 10000 prisoners. You try to kill them all during this month, because the next month you get 10000 new prisoners to kill.

Gulag: You have 20000 prisoners (and food for 10000). You try to work to death half of them during this month, because the next month you get 10000 more prisoners (and no more food).

And, technically, the prisoners in gulag are there for limited time, so if they survive enough rounds of elimination, in theory after 10 years they are allowed to go home. (In practice, after 10 years they will get 10 more years and stay where they are, because we do not want to spread the information about gulags to the average population. Also, slave labor is convenient for the socialist economy.)]]></description>

Recently I am not in contact with the young generation of woke people, but a few decades ago it was like this:

First there was a huge wave of outrage against female circumcision. It was assumed (I guess this is a default assumption for everything) that it is a horrible thing that &lt;i&gt;men&lt;/i&gt; do to little girls. The woke people expressed proper outrage, and some said that men who do this should be punished severely.

After getting some more information, it turned out that it is actually something that &lt;i&gt;women&lt;/i&gt; do to little girls. Suddenly there was no more talk about severe punishment of perpetrators; now it was a problem of the patriarchal culture. Then gradually the woke people stopped talking about this topic entirely.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯]]></description>

Yeah, much as I&#039;d like to take credit for them, &quot;Trump Derangement Syndrome&quot;, &quot;Obama Derangement Syndrome&quot; and &quot;Bush Derangement Syndrome&quot; have been around long enough that I&#039;m not sure who started it and who I cribbed it from. 

I don&#039;t think I &lt;i&gt;heard&lt;/i&gt; anyone talk about &quot;Clinton Derangement Syndrome&quot; during Bill&#039;s presidency, though there were certainly elements that would later become recognizable symptoms.]]></description>

Yeah having Vader get injured in Rogue One would have been a good way to explain his poor fighting in A New Hope.

That said, as cool as it was to watch Vader do the unstoppable walk of doom against the rebel scum,  that whole sequence was basically fanwank. In the original trilogy Darth Vader is a deadly starfighter pilot who also happens occasionally indulge in laser sword duels in the manner of his ancient religion. He never engages in ground or boarding combat, nor shows any interest or inclination towards doing so. He doesn&#039;t even draw his weapon outside of duels. Why would he? He&#039;s a pilot, not a commando, and he has legions of elite mooks to handle infantry combat for him.

However, since i happen to &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; fanwank Vader, i am not complaining about his inclusion over OG Vader in Rogue One. Though yes, it does introduce some inconsistencies with the rest of the story.]]></description>

Well, your comment makes me feel a little bit better, because I was just going through Google to find a previous comment I had made (regarding the brouhaha on the current OT) and stumbled across our &lt;a href=&quot;http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/01/08/open-thread-66-5/#comment-452125&quot;&gt;previous discussion of Jane&#039;s Law&lt;/a&gt; that I had completely forgotten about.  I felt like an asshole for a patronizing tone in my previous comment in this thread when your comment was obviously a simple mistake and you already knew who coined it.

I also agree that the Law is being bent beyond recognition by the devotees of the party in power being insane as well as smug.

And the &quot;Derangement Syndrome&quot; has been a feature of at least the last three administrations.  I recall when it was referred to as &quot;BDS&quot; for &quot;Bush Derangement Syndrome&quot;, exemplified by Dan Rather getting conned by Memogate.  ODS&#039;s exemplar is birtherism.]]></description>

I do think my proposed modification is a needed update. Trump derangement syndrome (I think that&#039;s John Schilling&#039;s phrase?) is enjoyable, but really both sides seem (from my bubble, anyway) to be retaining smugness, arrogance, and derangement.]]></description>

@CatCube

Thank you for the correction. It&#039;s funny, not only did I already know it was Megan McArdle who&#039;d coined Jane&#039;s Law, I&#039;d even flipped to and skimmed her Wikipedia page a couple times when quoting her law, which I have cited a handful of times. What&#039;s funny is, somehow I had always missed that she&#039;d had a previous career including a world-view-breaking (lefty -&#062;libertarian) at Nader&#039;s PIRGs and an MBA before becoming a journo. I&#039;d just seen she was born early enough to have finished college 10 years before she coined the law, and seen a line that she was a &quot;journalist for __&quot; at the time she coined it, and apparently just assumed the gap. 

Oops.]]></description>

...For what it&#039;s worth I think that we are there. Women who don&#039;t want to be pregnant have all the tools they need at their disposal to keep from getting pregnant.

What they lack is a responsible adult minder to force them to use those tools.

As committed as I am to getting rid of elective abortion, I would not trade putting the autonomy of every woman under the control of a minder in this manner to do away with every last excuse for &#039;unintended&#039; pregnancies.
