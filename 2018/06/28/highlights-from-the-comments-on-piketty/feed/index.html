The only out-and-out error in Piketty’s above statement is the attribution of multiple minimum wage increases to Obama when he signed none*, and this was duly corrected in his 2nd edition. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Milesmcculloughsurfing, thanks for responding, but there are several inaccuracies in the opening of your comment (the part I quoted above). 

First and most important, I wasn’t dismissing Piketty’s book because of his treatment of the U.S. minimum wage history. After all, the reason I’m in this discussion is that I was the co-author of a lengthy paper critiquing numerous parts of Piketty’s book. For me personally—as I relayed even in my comments here—the most jaw-dropping error in Piketty’s book was his summary of the Cambridge Capital Controversy. I linked to Jamie Galbraith’s equally incredulous reaction, to show that my view isn’t ideological. (Galbraith is a Post-Keynesian, I believe, and he’s son of the famous John Kenneth Galbraith, no darling of right-wingers.)

The reason I focused here on the minimum wage example is that it is something anybody can understand. Just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/chart.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;go look up the history of the U.S. minimum wage&lt;/a&gt;, and compare it to Piketty’s (a) original treatment and then (b) “corrected” treatment in the 2nd edition. It is totally wrong, in both editions, and moreover it doesn’t seem to be random error, but instead is systematically partisan.

Second, you are misunderstanding what Phil Magness and I were saying was the problem with Piketty’s initial treatment. The thing you’ve identified was actually not an “out-and-out error” (your term) in my opinion. If Piketty had merely attributed a minimum wage increase that occurred during the Obama years to Obama, when in fact it had been signed into law by George W. Bush, I would have had no problem with that. Especially because Piketty is not an American, it would be totally understandable for him to give a quick summary of the U.S. minimum wage based on a listing of what the levels were, at various points in history, and who the president happened to be at each uptick.

So to be clear, you apparently are missing the actual errors in Piketty, which are still in the 2nd edition. I’ll reproduce the relevant excerpt from Piketty first, and then list the mistakes it contains (in both editions).

&lt;blockquote&gt;“From 1980 to 1990, under the presidents Ronald Reagan and
George H. W. Bush, the federal minimum wage remained stuck at
$3.35, which led to a significant decrease in purchasing power when
inflation is factored in. It then rose to $5.25 under Bill Clinton in the
1990s and was frozen at that level under George W. Bush before
being increased several times by Barack Obama after 2008” (Piketty 2014,
p. 309).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

1)	The minimum wage rose to $5.15 under Clinton, not $5.25. &lt;i&gt;This&lt;/i&gt; I agree is simply a typo (which was not fixed in the 2nd edition).

2)	Piketty’s summary clearly leads the reader to conclude that the minimum wage was never raised under George H.W. Bush, when in fact it increased twice during his administration. The only way you can say Piketty’s summary is correct here, is if you also endorse the following statement, “Reagan remained fixed in the White House, until it was then occupied by Bill Clinton.”

3)	Piketty’s summary clearly leads the reader to conclude the minimum wage never increased under George W. Bush’s administration, when in fact it increased twice. (Yes, the fact that the single [not “several times” as Piketty tells it] increase under Obama was due to legislation signed by George W. Bush is ironic, but that’s not an actual mistake in Piketty’s narrative. That’s a minor point, compared to the demonstrably false statements in his summary.)

I am happy to consider your other points about the political struggles and the role of Reagan. Indeed, I am an opponent of minimum wage hikes (since I think they hurt the poorest workers) so it’s not a knock on Reagan in my opinion. But before we get into the nuances of the politics and inflation adjustments I want to be clear that Piketty’s two sentences quoted above contain a remarkable density of mistakes.

To reiterate, the purpose of my focusing on this is that anybody can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/chart.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;go look up the official U.S. government minimum wage history&lt;/a&gt;. If a high school student were doing a paper on this topic, and even on the 2nd draft after the teacher pointed out the mistakes couldn’t get the basic dates and levels correct, what would the teacher think about the more esoteric stuff? A lot of what Phil and I pointed out had to do with questionable “judgment calls” on Piketty’s part, and so his botching of the minimum wage history (there’s a similar pattern in his discussion of fiscal policy under Hoover vs. FDR) is evidence for neutral onlookers that Phil and I aren’t merely grinding an ideological axe.]]></description>

But... time still exists. This still seems blatantly absurd to me.

Let&#039;s say taxes lower the GDP by 10% today. So instead of 10, it&#039;s 9. Well, we have a growth rate of 100% next year GDP will be 20 (to make the math simple). With the 10% tax, the GDP would be 18 instead of 20. Etc. 10-20 and 9-18 are both doubling, so the relative rate is the same, but the absolute rate is still less.

Even if they could prove that, how is it beneficial to argue &quot;the economy will grow at the same relative rate, it will just be smaller both now and in the future&quot;?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/06/28/highlights-from-the-comments-on-piketty/#comment-644330&quot;&gt;Bob Murphy&lt;/a&gt;.

If that&#039;s the worst, most partisan error in Piketty, then I&#039;m not too concerned. If anything I&#039;m more concerned about you, Bob Murphy. You&#039;ve dismissed a 696 page book on a single, minor historical detail that was corrected in the second edition (contrary to your assertion).

The only out-and-out error in Piketty&#039;s above statement is the attribution of multiple minimum wage increases to Obama when he signed none*, and this was duly corrected in his 2nd edition. Changing &quot;frozen at that level under George W. Bush before being increased several times by Barack Obama after 2008&quot; to &quot;frozen at that level until legislation passed under George W. Bush led to an increase under Obama&quot; is arguably a typo if you squint your eyes, though I would prefer to call it a minor detail.

However the context of Piketty&#039;s thesis here is largely correct, namely that the Democrats have enacted more pro-labor legislation generally and done more to further minimum wage increases specifically than the Republicans since 1980 (really going back to 1933 at least). This can be clearly seen from your &quot;actual history&quot; which shows Republican presidents delayed minimum wage increases relative to Democratic presidents since at least 1980 (really since 1933 or before). H.W. and W. both effected a new increase only after the level had been frozen for 9 years whereas Clinton only allowed a 5 year freeze. If we consolidated Reagan/H.W. into a single Republican administration, then the 2 minimum wage increases under a Republican executive since 1980 occurred in the 3rd and 2nd presidential terms of Reagan/H.W. and W. respectively, while Clinton signed the only post-1980 minimum wage increase under a Democratic executive in his first presidential term.

Also, it is notable that minimum wages increases since 1938 have always occurred when Democrats control both houses of Congress (with the sole mixed exception of the 1996 expansion under Clinton which also narrowed the base by dropping tipped workers which had previously been included). Since Congress is theoretically in control of the purse-strings the legislative branch should probably be the most important one to consider when evaluating the history of the minimum wage. Curiously, Clinton and Obama each had Democratic control of both houses during the first 2 years of their administrations, and both used that time to focus on expanding health care as their top priority.

Moreover, it is interesting that your &quot;actual history&quot; here is a list of nominal minimum wages which tells a conveniently bipartisan story of minimum wage increases when a graph of real minimum wages shows a 50-year decline, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Labor_Standards_Act_of_1938#/media/File:History_of_US_federal_minimum_wage_increases.svg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the entirety of which is attributable to Reagan&#039;s tenure&lt;/a&gt;. Republican presidents have delayed minimum wage increases for as a long as feasible - Eisenhower signed an increase in his 3rd year in office after a 5 year freeze, Nixon in his 6th year after a 3 year freeze (Johnson&#039;s phased increases lasted into Nixon&#039;s 3rd year in office), Reagan did not sign one in 8 years, H.W. signed one in his 1st year after a 8 year freeze, and W. signed one in his 7th year after a 9 year freeze** - and only then when forced by a Democrat-controlled legislative branch, whereas Democrat presidents have consistently urged minimum wage increases and before 1980 frequently signed them in their first year possible. FDR, Kennedy, and Carter all did so in their first year in office. Truman oversaw a large phased increased during his 1st year in office and signed a major increase in his 5th year. Johnson signed an increase after a 1 year freeze following Kennedy&#039;s phased increase. Clinton signed an increase in his 4th year in office after a 5 year freeze. Obama did not sign one in 8 years.

*Even here the nominal minimum wage story masks Obama&#039;s pro-minimum wage stance on 3 counts: 1) Obama strongly supported several bills to increase the minimum wage but he was stymied by a record-breaking obstructionist Congress, 2) Obama&#039;s signature policy of healthcare expansion could be interpreted as a sort of minimum wage increase as it broadened benefits to low-end labor, and 3) Obama&#039;s tenure saw cumulative CPI inflation of 14% compared to Reagan&#039;s 36% (the only other full term president not to increase the minimum wage since its inception), thus the impact was blunted by the equivalent of a $1.39 minimum wage increase.

**One characteristic of delayed signing is that it allowed Republicans to take credit for minimum wage increases while taking the sails out of the impetus in future administrations, successfully sapping Obama&#039;s planned minimum wage increases of urgency in W.&#039;s case.

tl;dr Piketty got it essentially right. You characterize the question as &quot;not hard&quot;, but it is only easy if you simplify minimum wage history down to which presidents signed off on increases. When you consider length of delay between increases, party control of congress during increases and between increases, and inflation effects it becomes clear that Democrats are pro-labor legislation. Which shouldn&#039;t be surprising really. Everyone knows Democrats are pro-labor and Republicans are pro-capital. That&#039;s been the case since at least 1894 when William Jennings Bryan (D) proposed a progressive income tax and Woodrow Wilson (D) implemented it in 1913 (with help from a Democrat-controlled House and Senate btw). It was less arguably the case throughout the 19th century when Democrats were consistently pro-Southern - i.e. anti-tariff to help farmers, pro-slavery/Jim Crow to help rich farmers, pro-inflation to help indebted sharecroppers, and anti-immigrant to help white farm laborers.]]></description>

I don´t think that 40 % of income devoted to consumption is unusually large fraction. I am claiming that under r&#062;g, where r=5 and g=3, with initial capital to income ratio 4 to 1, and higly unequal initial distribution of capital between members of society, such level of consumption by rentiers is not sufficient to prevent growth of  inequality in capital incomes. As stated, in this hypothetical situation share of capital income in overall income will also grow. To be clear, this is not supposed to be prediction of what will really happen, I simply use numbers for r and g you picked.]]></description>

I am claiming that under r&gt;g, where r=5 and g=3, with initial capital to income ratio 4 to 1, and higly unequal initial distribution of capital between members of society, such level of consumption by rentiers is not sufficient to prevent growth of  inequality in capital incomes. As stated, in this hypothetical situation share of capital income in overall income will also grow. To be clear, this is not supposed to be prediction of what will really happen, I simply use numbers for r and g you picked.</p>

&lt;blockquote&gt;If r is 5 % and g is 3 %, while wealtholders consume 2 % of their fortune (and non-capital income of wealtholders is assumed to be trivial), share of national income received by wealtholders will stay the same only in highly special case when national wealth (C) is equal to national income (Y).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That is not correct. To begin with, as blumenko points out, wealth and income are in different units so C=Y is meaningless, like saying that my height is or is not greater than my weight.

Let g be the rate at which national wealth is increasing, r the interest rate. Rentiers are people who are living on the income from their wealth invested at rate r, so their income is r times their wealth. If their consumption is c times their wealth--2% in my example—then the annual increase in their wealth is (r-c) times their wealth—3% in my example. If that&#039;s equal to g, then their share of national wealth is staying constant. 

If you prefer, let g be the rate at which national income is increasing. The same argument tells you that the ratio of the wealth of the rentiers to national income is staying constant in my example. It also tells you that the ratio of the income of rentiers to national income is staying constant, since the income of rentiers is proportional to their wealth, r held constant. 

It&#039;s all accounting identities.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Perhaps I shoud´ve written “unusually large” instead of “giant”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In my example, the rentier is consuming 40% of his income, saving 60%. You think that&#039;s an unusually high fraction of income for someone to consume, where &quot;consumption&quot; includes charitable donations, political donations, and the like?

Remember that rentiers are not all billionaires. Some of them are widows and orphans living on the income of what they were left, consuming at least all of that income, possibly more. In our society a lot of capital is held by pension funds, where again consumption is at least a hundred percent of income.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;It did not have to be the case that Sweden is a nicer place to live than the United States during the Gilded Age. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

That&#039;s a misleading comparison, because Sweden today is much richer than the United States during the Gilded Age, and it is richer in large part because for much of the intervening period it was a relatively laissez-faire society--more so than most of the rest of Europe. 

A better comparison would be between Bismarck&#039;s Prussia, which invented a good deal of the modern mixed economy/welfare state,  and England or the U.S. at the same time.]]></description>

They are saying gdp is lowered permanently by let&#039;s say 10%, and that has no units of time, so it is not compounded year after year. Today gdp is 10% lower than potential and in 10 years it will also be lower by 10% than the theoretical maximum, which isn&#039;t affected by labor taxes.]]></description>

I&#039;m not sure what the argument is here. If something lowers GDP today and lowers it in the future by the same amount (compounded year over year) then it necessarily slows growth rate. I think I&#039;m misunderstanding you, because the claim appears to be that taxes slow growth but won&#039;t slow growth.]]></description>

Oh as a follow-up: In his reply to Fox News when they asked Piketty about our paper, he said he was sorry for any typos and would fix them in an upcoming edition.

Well, someone took photos of his new edition and he only fixed some of the errors on the minimum wage. (See shots &lt;a href=&quot;https://consultingbyrpm.com/blog/2018/04/maybe-piketty-will-fix-his-basic-facts-in-the-third-edition.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) Again, this is as &quot;hard&quot; as going to the BLS and looking at the history of the minimum wage. He got it totally wrong--in a coincidentally partisan fashion--the first time, and then even after fixing it, it&#039;s still wrong. As David Friedman says (referring to Piketty&#039;s statement about Ricardian economics), this is the kind of stuff that can only be explained by extreme carelessness or dishonesty. Either way, it&#039;s not good, especially for someone whose ostensible expertise is as an economic historian who&#039;s careful with the stats.]]></description>
