					<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&lt;code&gt;He thinks that executive salaries have increased because – basically – corporate governance isn’t good enough to prevent executives from giving themselves very high salaries. Why didn’t executives give themselves such high salaries before? Because before the 1980s the US had a top tax rate of 80% to 90%. As theory predicts, people become less interested in making money when the government’s going to take 90% of it, so executives didn’t bother pulling the strings it would take to have stratospheric salaries. Once the top tax rate was decreased, it became worth executives’ time to figure out how to game the system, so they did. This is less common outside the Anglosphere because other countries have different forms of corporate governance and taxation that discourage this kind of thing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
Piketty is smart but I think a better explanation of the rise of the super-salaried, proto-rentier class is to found in Slavoj Zizek. In summary, Zizek argues that the divide between the entrepreneur ideal beloved by free market theorists, a la Ayn Rand, which in real life only exists in some parts of high tech industry, and on the other hand the well-connected fat-cat reality that permeates every other industry. The key of this thesis is simple: entrepreneurs rarely own any companies these days, as the majority of shareholders are anonymous pension and investment funds, as well as humble retail investors; the new capitalist upper class is not an entrepreneurial class but a managerial class that owns few if any shares in the company that provides these managers with company chauffeurs and jets, huge bonuses rain or shine, free VIP tickets to sports events and luxurious offices with phalanxes of devoted servants.

Zizek compares this class to the Soviet Union’s upper class, the nomenklatura. In his talks, he frequently notes that the USSR provided the first model of the developed “post-property” society where the people/the shareholders/the taxpayers own the means of production, a “late capitalism” in which the ruling class is defined by direct access to the informational or administrative means of social power and control and to other material and social privileges: the point will never again be to have ownership of companies, but to run them, a privilege which will is acquired not by property, but by other means, notably an education in the oligarchy’s proper breeding grounds, be that the Lenin school or Harvard, and connections.

To continue the argument, Zizek borrows from Lacan’s readings of Freud to explain how we got to the point in which we are: the old bourgeoisie becomes middle-ranking salaried management and appropriates whatever surplus value is left, a measure that is not a concession from rulers signifying that they are valuable or needed, but a social mechanism of contention. The upper class needs the middle class to act as a cushion from the frustrations of the lower class. And the—to keep using Zizek’s much-beloved Marxist lingo—”lumpen-proletarians” are left at the bottom, but not simmering in frustration. This is because modern education and political systems in developed economies act as a conduit for some measure of social mobility; and if the reason for this social mobility, why some red necks become rock stars and why some grocers’ children end up as prime minister, but no others of apparently similar or superior capacity, is pure, unadorned randomness. Like one of those lotteries-plus-death-match deciding which teenager becomes a top-notch warrior in young adult novels and movies such as The Hunger Games. As Zizek wrote in a 2012 essay for the London Review of Books:

“The arbitrariness of social hierarchy is not a mistake, but the whole point, with the arbitrariness of evaluation playing an analogous role to the arbitrariness of market success. Violence threatens to explode not when there is too much contingency in the social space, but when one tries to eliminate contingency.”

The problem in developed societies, Zizek argues, comes not from brilliant low-borns whose aspirations are frustrated, plotting revolution in blogs. The problem comes from the majority composed by the not-so brilliant. There are no evil cabals working so that modern societies won’t become true meritocracies. Modern societies function this way out of self-preservation: if they were to become true meritocracies, they would be destroyed by those who would be told, bluntly, that they are not good enough for the finer things in life.]]></description>

You should understand that I am mostly &lt;i&gt;in favor&lt;/i&gt; of freedom of association. I tend to agree with your analysis, and am trying to understand if there are principled reasons for exceptions to it.

The exception for things people &quot;don’t have control over&quot; does not seem principled, at least partly because one has varying degrees of control over different aspects of one&#039;s presentation. Asking an investment banker to quit his job seems extreme and not much worse than asking him to change his skin color. From the other end, and granting that there are exceptions, many bigots&#039; objections to non-whites are not actually related to their skin color but to what is perceived as their dysfunctional culture -- or even just their &lt;i&gt;different&lt;/i&gt; culture, perhaps stemming from a preconscious understanding of the fact that peaceful, high-trust societies tend to be the more homogenous.]]></description>

&lt;i&gt;So, if I am physically capable of changing a behavior that you find objectionable, like drinking lattes and working in the financial industry, it would be acceptable for you to exclude me from your neighborhood, but it would be unacceptable for you exclude me because I am white?&lt;/i&gt;

It would be a different kind of basis for exclusion. I was responding to stucchio seeming to conflate the two.

Whether either, or both, would be acceptable or unacceptable will depend on the person. One of the things America was supposed to be was a country where people with different notions of what was acceptable or unacceptable could form communities based on those different notions.

&lt;i&gt;In either case, it seems to me that somebody has some conception of what he wants his neighborhood to be like, and is trying to co-opt the power of the state in order to enforce that conception. Whether the conception is legitimate or not, I don’t see how you can call it anything but rent-seeking.&lt;/i&gt;

In our current society, yes, people do try to co-opt the power of the state to enforce their conceptions. And this applies just as much to people who want to eliminate segregation as to people who want to support it. So if it&#039;s rent-seeking for the latter to do it, it&#039;s also rent-seeking for the former to do it. In the particular case under discussion, if it&#039;s rent-seeking for deBoer and his neighbors to try to get the city government to forbid the new development, it&#039;s also rent-seeking for the developers to try to get the city government to allow the new development. Both are trying to co-opt the power of the state to enforce their conception of how things should be.

The usual objection raised against libertarians who give the obvious solution to this dilemma--stop giving the state the power to enforce one particular conception on everybody--is that the objector&#039;s personal vision of how society should be could no longer be enforced. Yes, that&#039;s true. One of the prices of living in a free country is that people are free to form communities based on different norms than yours.]]></description>

&lt;i&gt;Can you explain to me how they differ?&lt;/i&gt;

People don&#039;t have control over their skin color or ethnicity. People do have control over their behavior. So it doesn&#039;t make sense (to me, at least) for a community to set standards of skin color or ethnicity; but it does make sense to set standards of behavior. Or at least, it would seem that the two are very different kinds of reasons for wanting to segregate.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;So to you, segregating based on preferred behaviors is no different from segregating based on skin color or ethnicity?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is a great question. 

Return on capital is caused by the fact that people are willing to pay for &quot;services&quot; (utility) capital provides, i.e. landlord is earning a rent because there is demand for housing in his apartment. There is of course correlation between how much income people have and how much money they are willing to spend on rent in given apartment. Which means than when  national nominal income/GDP (nominal GDP and national nominal income are not the same thing but are usually highly corelated) grows, nominal return on capital also usually grows. But in no way it implies that when  nominal national income grows 5 %, nominal return on capital should be 5 %. It only implies that nominal return on capital will, absent some unusual circumstances like enactment of new wealth tax, be higher in 5 % than in 0 % growth scenario. 

Now, even if nominal growth is 0 %, there is no logical reason to expect that nominal return on capital would be 0 %. Even if no one´s income would increase, people would still pay rent, buy food etc. and owners of housing, supermarkets etc. would thus still earn some return on their capital.

&quot;Society&quot; cannot &lt;i&gt;simply&lt;/i&gt; build more things which are in demand and thus increase its growth rate because it is facing what economists call supply costraints. Which could be anything that prevents, um, producers, from producing more stuff that people want. From shortage of natural resources through lack of incentives for inventing new products to government regulations. Growth in labor productivity means that society is slowly learning how to overcome its supply constrains.

I realize this is imperfect answer but your question is so huge that it could serve as starting point for a long book.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Has anyone ever considered the idea of implementing an inheritance tax that taxes not the amount passed on, but the amount received? For example, instead of a tax that taxed less than $5M passed on at 0% and more than $5M passed on at 100%, consider a tax that taxed less than $1M received at 0% and more than  $1M received at 100% (just illustrative numbers, in reality you wouldn&#039;t have a hard threshold like that).

This seems like it might be a good way to incentivize rentiers to have more children, and thus to disperse their wealth over generations. In the above example, rentiers who had &#062;5 children (and split their estate equally) would lose nothing from their estate, but the wealth would be dispersed. A rentier who attempted to preserve and concentrate their estate over the generations by having only one child, or by practicing primogeniture, would lose 80%.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;But given 1B less people and way more redistribution of wealth, there would be whole lot more to go around per person.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Are you assuming that the main source of income is natural resources, of which there would be more per capita? I would have said that the main source is human effort, which goes down along with the population. There would be more land per person but not more of produced goods, services, anything produced by labor, except in the very short run where the survivors were sharing out stuff already produced.]]></description>
