Re optionality of savage punishments in ancient law codes: the draconian punishment&#039;s being optional was a feature of the Laws of Manu. E.g., it is prescribed that adultery with your guru&#039;s wife would be punishable either by a painful ritual suicide, or a long walk seven times around [something; it&#039;s been years since my class]. Intuitively it&#039;d operate somewhat like our system of plea-bargaining.]]></description>

I&#039;m surprised that after all this effort w.r.t. the Hebrew Bible, you&#039;re only going to do one on the NT, which is the one you know better.  (For example, maybe first do Paul and then the Gospels.)  But it&#039;s your effort being spent, so up to you.]]></description>

Can&#039;t we also say that you were all guessing what your brother would like and you just happened to guess correctly? Your guess may have been better because you used your experience to treat your brother like you would like to be treated in a similar situation, but you still could have been wrong. For example, imagine your brother likes different things from you and actually does want people to fuss over him when he is hurt.

There is a difference between the thought process &quot;that person is feeling [x] what should I do?&quot; and &quot;that person is feeling [x] what would they like?&quot; but there&#039;s always guesswork, both as to what [x] is and what the person would like because of [x].]]></description>

@rahien.din

&lt;blockquote&gt;Furthermore, the paper basically asked people to estimate, for instance, P(LGBT &#124; liberal &#038; voter), which is the opposite of what anyone actually cares about.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I would argue that people who are into identity politics or who want to understand the behavior of those who are into identity politics would care about such a thing.]]></description>

@Spookykou

I think that a lot of what is called empathy is really typical minding. This is what your mother and aunt did.

What you did was truly empathy, where you actually understood the needs of the other person.

People who are very dissimilar from others seem to often feel little empathy from others, suggesting that true empathy is in short supply.]]></description>

So far as anybody knows it hasn&#039;t been done, and we probably would know if it had. That being said, there is a  decent chance that the US air force did recover a Soviet spacecraft from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kecksburg_UFO_incident&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;crash site in Pennsylvania &lt;/a&gt;    

On December 9th 1965 Kosmos 96, a Soviet probe destined for Venus that had failed to leave low earth orbit,   reentered the Earth&#039;s atmosphere over north America. That afternoon a bright fireball was spotted heading south across Canada, over the Detroit-Windsor area, towards Pittsburgh where witnesses reported hearing a sonic boom. After residents in the small town of Kecksburg reported seeing an object come down USAF personnel were dispatched to search the area,  they would later claim to have found nothing. 

The incident would enter UFO lore when witnesses  claimed to have seen the military removing an acorn shaped object covered in &quot;hieroglyphic&quot; (one might speculate Cyrillic) writing. Some have claimed that radar telemetry tracked cosmos 96  coming down around  three in the morning on the 9th, thus ruling out the fireball seen thirteen hours later as being the Soviet craft. Nevertheless, I&#039;m not so sure. 

While I don&#039;t doubt NASA tracked something coming down that morning, I&#039;m not sure we can be sure that it was all of Cosmos 96. The craft failed because an explosion occurred in one of the combustion chambers on the third state of the Molniya rocket that was carrying the probe; that leaves a lot of unspent delta-v in the fourth stage, and the small rockets on the probe itself. 

If either of those stores of fuel exploded, then perhaps different fragments of the craft were on different enough orbits to come down hours apart.]]></description>
