&lt;blockquote&gt;Getting an economic reward, in terms of land, for military service is a fairly central example of the concept ‘feudal overlordship’.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is a very broad definition of feudal. There is no oath of loyalty (the feud in feudal) or recurring service to a king (another feud oath) or a class of bound peasantry or subinfeudation (the creation of sub-feudal lords) or... well, most of the features of European feudalism. If feudalism is just &quot;rewarding soldiers with land&quot; we&#039;re basically covering every society ever. Including the Rome, Medieval England, and the current US. You could even argue the Soviet Union, since although they didn&#039;t own the land, they often did manage it. (And, in fact, that is the legal case in medieval England.)

&lt;blockquote&gt;I really didn’t have to omit a lot of text between those two claims; which one do you stand by?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Both statements. There is no contradiction. I&#039;ll spell it out: in Brazil, it is illegal to make &lt;b&gt;new&lt;/b&gt; enfiteuses and the current ones are being slowly killed by attrition (since they now have conditions after which the lien is removed). However, there is a court case to abolish them all immediately.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Similarly, those who use their private army to serve national ends can provide a valuable service to that nation. The question is to what extent is that is the only, or best, way to run a military.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Certainly. Those are two specific policy questions. I&#039;m not sure what your point is here. This is one of the points of the Second Amendment: a bunch of private armies were expected to make the US harder to invade.

&lt;blockquote&gt;True; it merely provides me with an explanation as to why you will no doubt continue to hold your opinions in the face of what, to me, looks like pretty strong evidence that they are invalid. I mean, a direct self-contradiction within two sentences is fairly high on the scale of how invalid an argument can possibly be…&lt;/blockquote&gt;
If you&#039;re interested in a genuine exchange of ideas, I suggest you read my post again with the clarifications. Hopefully that will let you understand what I meant and formulate more of a reply.]]></description>

[Blargh, finally getting back to this, sorry.  Maybe sometime we should resume in an open thread or something that game theory discussion that actually seemed to be going somewhere...]

I mean, you&#039;ve addressed the narrow point, but not the broader one.  Using this Hegelian idea of &quot;contradiction&quot; -- using these Hegelian notions, rather than formulating all this in modern mathematical language -- is a serious mistake!  Why should I ever take seriously something founded in Hegelian notions rather than thought that at least &lt;i&gt;attempts&lt;/i&gt; to be precise and mathematical?  That is to say, even if this use of the word &quot;contradiction&quot; might not be fuzzy thinking per se, it sure seems to indicate that such is likely present nearby!

Like, some of these &quot;contradictions&quot; seem like they should be pretty modelable as dynamical systems.  So where is that?  Where are the differential equations of leftism, where&#039;s the predictions they generate?  Sure, I expect they&#039;re hard in general and can&#039;t necessarily be used to easily extract predictions, but where&#039;s the most basic, primitive test model, as, you know, a starting point?  (Beyond r&#062;g, that is.  Like, where&#039;s the mathematical model of the concentration of capital that Marx predicted and the effects of such, as described by citizencokane below?  Or is that a prediction we should discard?)

Until the Hegelian framework is discarded and leftist ideas are reformulated mathematically, I see no reason to treat leftism as anything more than something like, say, the Italian school of algebraic geometry -- something to occasionally dredge good ideas out of , for those willing to put in the work of wading through the swamp, but certainly not something to take seriously as it is or swallow whole.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&lt;code&gt;One might argue that Britain invested money in developing Africa, which can only work with the prospect of repayment on normal investment terms. And one might even argue that it’s no worse for the average African laborer to have X% of his country’s money go to British elites he doesn’t know vs. than to African elites he doesn’t know. But this would be overstating the case – the British elites spend their money primarily in Britain, further developing Britain’s economy, whereas the African elites could be expected to spend their money mostly in Africa. And since (absent appropriation) a capitalist’s ownership of capital lasts forever, the British do a one-time positive action (investing in Africa) that produces an eternal negative action (having them get to drain some of Africa’s money forever). Although it’s not provably/necessarily true, in real life this is probably worse for Africa than leaving it alone and/or letting it invite foreign investment on the much better terms it could certainly have gotten if its governments weren’t controlled by the same people it was trying to negotiate with.

This also helps me understand the “colonialism still hurts countries today” position better.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

References to the effect of colonialism in Africa are often misleading. Lots of anecdotal evidence (pretty much every memoir by a non-African traveler there, all of Naipaul&#039;s African-themed ouevre) refer to the inability of low-skilled, uneducated and uninterested African bureaucrats to take care of and repair of colonial-era public works and utilities, that have crumbled over time. Compare that with the net beneficial effect of colonialism particularly on places like Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore (not to speak of British sunk costs on the American colonies and, to a lesser extent, in dominions like Canada and Australia) that owe almost all of their comparative strengths to colonial-era advancements like British Common Law, infrastructures and social arrangements. As a rule, colonialism strikes anyone as a stupid thing to defend, but the devil is in the details here too.]]></description>

I don&#039;t think I agree with your position here. In particular, I don&#039;t agree that this meaning is sufficiently removed from the basic logic definition to reasonably demand that the two meanings find different words - it preserves the crucial quality that two things cannot both be true at the same time. In the land use example from Harvey, using the land for fuel production and using the land for food production does present a logical contradiction. &#039;The land is used for fuel production&#039; DOES imply Not(&#039;the land is used for food production), for that time and place with its available technology and organisational forms. 

This is different from a pure logical contradiction - it is entirely conceivable from a modern standpoint to find some way of perhaps growing a fuel plant/algae and a food plant in heteroculture on the same plot of land and generating more total output, for example. It is a logical contradiction only over a certain set of boundary conditions. But then a substantial part of the uses of logical contradictions hold only under a given set of assumptions, do they not?

The left academic tradition looks towards Hegelian contradictions because they are very frequently triggers for change. A fruitful way to try and predict what sorts of changes might happening by examining the contradictions present in the current state and try to imagine in what ways they may be resolved. 

I totally agree that Pikkety was wrong to use the word logical in the sentence you quote, however. It is explicitly Hegelian contradictions rather than logical contradictions in that case. But I don&#039;t find that on balance, the Hegelian contradiction is a bad use of language.]]></description>

As fullfactexplained, the borrowing was more of a response to the 2008 crash than a pre existing policy.

I mean, in terms of opportunity cost, perhaps.  But in terms of actual costs, you could really find ways to cut the expense down, living off the land to a degree which is foreign to our modern abilities, sleeping rough, etc.  The point I&#039;m trying to make here is that not everybody had the expense of fancy carriages.]]></description>

@Arlie:

I think SJW as I would use it combines two ideas. &quot;Social Justice&quot; signals a particular view of what is just. At the simplest level it&#039;s a leftish egalitarianism of outcome—if some groups (racial, sexual, sexual identity, ...) do worse than others, there must be injustice. In practice that&#039;s combined with a particular set of beliefs about who society is unjust to. I would not expect a believer in social justice to note that women live longer than men and conclude that the society is unjustly anti-man.

At a more sophisticated level, I think the term signals the idea that a society can be unjust without any individual acting unjustly, hence &quot;social&quot; adds something to &quot;justice.&quot;

&quot;Warrior&quot; describes an attitude towards tactics. I wouldn&#039;t expect an SJW to quote &quot;all is fair in love and war,&quot; but that&#039;s the tone of the label—if you really care about social justice, any weapon you can use to fight it is legitimate. That fits with punching Nazis, trying to get people with the wrong views fired, and the like. 

The combination of those two is what SJW means to me. &quot;Warrior&quot; alone would also describe a fascist. SJ alone is consistent with the traditional ACLU support for freedom of speech and the like. 

Going back to &quot;trigger warnings.&quot; I think the main reason people on the right are suspicious of the term is that they see it as a disguised attack on freedom of speech. The implied argument is &quot;your saying something hurts me the same way your hitting me would hurt me, so saying something is an attack, so it&#039;s legitimate to stop you from saying it.&quot;

That wouldn&#039;t apply to the legitimate idea of prefacing something with a warning about content that might bother some listeners or readers, if you go on to say it—they are free not to listen or read. 

I suppose a secondary reason to be suspicious of it is the suspicion that people use the idea of trigger warnings to protect themselves from learning things--for instance hearing arguments against their views--that they don&#039;t want to learn.]]></description>

<p>That wouldn&#8217;t apply to the legitimate idea of prefacing something with a warning about content that might bother some listeners or readers, if you go on to say it—they are free not to listen or read. </p>
<p>I suppose a secondary reason to be suspicious of it is the suspicion that people use the idea of trigger warnings to protect themselves from learning things&#8211;for instance hearing arguments against their views&#8211;that they don&#8217;t want to learn.</p>

&lt;blockquote&gt;People doing useful work increase the size of the pot that gets split; the fact they get little in return is a problem for them; it doesn’t make them a problem.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to your original definition it does not matter how little they get in return. What matters is whether they get more or less than they contribute. So even if warlords take 90% of oil revenue and just 10% is spent on subsidies for subsistence farmers, the latter are still “parasites” according to your definition.

People doing useful work do increase the size of the pot that gets split. But unless what they take out of this pot is less than they contribute their relationship to other people is no longer “symbiotic”.]]></description>
