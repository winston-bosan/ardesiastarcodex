					<description><![CDATA[I skimmed the comments &#038; didn&#039;t see what I expected to be a fairly obvious criticism/caveat with regard to the model presented: the moral landscape (i.e., the graph of moral effort to intended results) isn&#039;t flat. For instance, much of the effort one goes through to strike is wasted if scabs cross the line (and this is why there&#039;s a system of social censure against scabs). Breakthroughs in desirable results often have a drastically non-linear relationship to the amount of effort it takes to engage in them -- as Scott has covered before with the beef vs chicken thing -- and this mirrors results in domains where the goal is not ethics but something else (like chip density, as covered in another recent post).

In this sense, a low bar might keep us in stasis for much longer than is necessary -- we can perpetually keep the amount of effort we&#039;re willing to go through to make some social change below the level necessary to achieve the quorum necessary to make that change (or below the level where structural inertia eats all our progress).

This all gets mixed up when we consider that these efforts are invested into a marketplace of proxies for some global ethical-ness. Even if we assume that a global ethics exists, it&#039;s uncontroversial that we have a hard time defining it, and that everything we do has some dubious effectiveness at some second-order proxy of &#039;good behavior&#039;. So, some part of the lower 50% will almost inevitably have some twist in their thinking that makes them in the upper 50% from their perspective -- acting as brakes on the inevitable upward movement. There&#039;s always going to be a small group of accelerationists who think giving to charity is bad because it delays the revolution (or who think being rapaciously capitalist is good because it motivates the proletariat to revolt), or some social darwinists who think that refusing to kill and eat animals will cause the breed to become weak, or paternalistic racists who think black people will be unable to manage themselves if not enslaved, or whatever.

I like the idea of carefully analyzing the bars we&#039;re setting. But, instead of picking 50%, we probably ought to figure out what kind of effort is necessary for some concrete goal &#038; aim for slightly higher than that amount of effort to be the norm in our clique (divided by clique size, and with the amount of effort any opposing cliques will put in added on top).]]></description>

Think about number of people affected and length of time: half the population was female, and they had little autonomy and legal power (and very little respect for anything intellectual) their whole lives.

					<description><![CDATA[I am pescatarian. On the topic of vegetarianism:

I think it&#039;s strange how people seem to fail to make distinction between types of meat. To my understanding, pigs are quite intelligent, cows far less so, and chickens are near braindead. Insofar as intelligence is a proxy for capacity to suffer and depth of suffering, my opinion is that it&#039;s much more immoral to eat pork than beef, and if you must cheat, eat chicken.

Also, I think an oft-neglected alternative to lab-grown meat is selective breeding of farm animals for reduced cognitive ability. If we can reduce animals to be mere sacks of flesh with no sapience then the ethical argument (at least on the front of suffering, if not of the gargantuan waste of resources that is farming animals) disappears.]]></description>

I see it as being incredibly implausible that information theory, independent of any properties of human psychology, social dynamics, etc, can give such a simplistic answer to this question. This is not a math problem.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Deny me the right to feel okay when I do my half-assed attempt at virtue, and I will just make no attempt at virtue, and this will be worse for me and worse for animals.&quot;  The new play The Niceties is almost entirely about this problem.  It includes the following great line: &quot;If you make it hard enough to be good, you make it really easy to be bad.&quot;

[The Niceties is not about veganism, but racism, but the point is the same.  It instantiates the conflict between a woke millennial and her history professor.]]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would say that extinction is our moral duty (we have the technology already, but it might be better to wait until we can really cook the planet all the way through to prevent intelligent life from evolving again)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It seems very dangerous to me, I don’t think the &quot;planet boiling&quot; will stay very long boiling and that it will be perfectly complete, and so life could re-spread pretty quickly and we have to wait some billions of years again before having some rational agents with these kind of goals.

I prefer the AI path.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;If you think intelligence and tendency towards altruism are even slightly heritable, then by not having children (and I mean the committed antinatalists) are dooming the future of humanity to people that are less intelligent and less altruistic than them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It seems like a long term concern given how many generations a slight influence will need to spread.

When not having children, free you a lot of time and money you could use to influence the world much more strongly and in short-term and middle-term. (have influence on the non-heritable part, modify society structure, help with some FAI problems, etc…)]]></description>
