					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve zero interest in the enlightenment angle here, but am interested in seeing another version of Society of Mind. HOWEVER
I see that, once again, the trickiest issues have been glossed over (as Scott points out). Forget the issue of my &quot;wanting to do something useful&quot; self fighting it out with my &quot;wanting to lie in bed&quot; self; let&#039;s ask something simpler --- what does &quot;fighting it out&quot; mean?

Let&#039;s consider one example: your auditory subsystem is hearing traffic and hears screeching tires, so your consciousness attends to that.
In the computing context we could imagine something like the auditory processor generates a high-priority interrupt that changes the flow of control in the &quot;primary&quot; processor. OK, great, we can imagine something physical, an extra large dose of neurotransmitter X, or sending a signal down the special red neuron, or whatever. BUT if there&#039;s anything we&#039;ve learned from Meditations on Moloch, it&#039;s that if something has an incentive to grow, it will. In this context, what&#039;s keeping the auditory processor &quot;honest&quot;? Why doesn&#039;t it just fire high priority interrupts all the time? Or go to the other extreme and just not bother?

Now you can say something about evolution selecting for pre-wired auditory systems that only fire when something important happens (let&#039;s put aside the issue of how &quot;something important&quot; is decided by saying &quot;the neural network is trained for that&quot;); but ask the same question now in the more abstract space of &quot;different ideas vying for consciousness&quot;, ie this boardroom that&#039;s somehow allowing different sub-minds occasional control...

I&#039;m willing to accept the model being presented for things like physical and auditory stimulation; there&#039;s enough of a plausible story there from actual bits of bespoke brain matter, to mechanisms whereby &quot;attention&quot; however that happens might be requested, to arguments for why the attention requests might (usually; there are always diseases and pathologies) be an honest signal. 

But it seems that this idea is then translated into something more abstract, where the players are now not physical pieces of the brain but &quot;subminds&quot; of some sort, one-track thoughts that somehow battle it out on Sakaar. 
And while I agree that this model better represents lived experience than the unitary consciousness model (ie we HAVE made progress beyond Descartes), I don&#039;t think it can make further progress until we have some suggestions (they don&#039;t have to be perfect or even correct, they just have to conceptualize the issue properly) of how it is that these subminds &quot;fight&quot; each other (let&#039;s leave what it means to &quot;win&quot; for later). THIS is the point where I get stuck because I can&#039;t think of any sort of useful model of what this means -- certainly the analogy that this is a boardroom where everyone gives a speech then votes is useless, as is the analogy of some sort of Contest of Champions. 
What are we even talking about? &quot;My 40 Hz resonance of neurons can beat up your 42Hz resonance of neurons?&quot; &quot;All your GABAA are belong to us?&quot;]]></description>

Thank you for your kind words! I&#039;m happy to find out that we&#039;re on the same page after all.

&lt;i&gt;It sounds though, like you agree with me that renunciation forms of Theravada did not provide a very desirable final goal?&lt;/i&gt;

Oh yes, definitely. From my perspective, it feels like they are missing the whole point of what one could learn from insight practices... instead of accepting that all emotions are fine and that there&#039;s no need to get rid of them, renunciation seems to cling to a desire to just extinguish emotions - which sure, if you &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; care about eliminating your own suffering, might work for that particular objective. But that seems like a very self-centered (ironically enough) goal to me, and really only makes sense in the kind of a religious framework where reincarnation is a thing: after all, if you want to effectively commit suicide, there are much faster and easier ways to do that. It&#039;s only if you assume that death usually leads to rebirth, that you need to come up with a much more elaborate way of destroying yourself.

(To be fair, this is probably a caricature of the renunciate view, given that I&#039;ve basically never run into someone making a serious argument for it, so they&#039;ve probably got a more sophisticated argument in favor. I highly doubt that I&#039;d find even the sophisticated version particularly persuasive, though.)]]></description>

Thanks for the links.  I concede that my initial post was too alarmist.  (It sounds though, like you agree with me that renunciation forms of Theravada did not provide a very desirable final goal?)

My position is not that it is impossible to get anything useful or valuable out of insight meditation.  I&#039;m actually glad for you that it&#039;s been helpful for you to feel more alive and engaged with the world!  

I&#039;m not denying the existence of positive aspects of Buddhist meditation techniques; rather I&#039;m saying that I&#039;m sufficiently out of sympathy with the philosophical goals of most Buddhist schools (to the extent that I understand them) that I wouldn&#039;t trust the process of myself (or any random person) engaging with them deeply to produce an expected net positive outcome, from the perspective of my own ethical code (and belief in the validity of dualistic logic, which contradicts at least some schools of Buddhist thought).  But I&#039;m not trying to deny that net positive outcomes are possible, nor do I have any reason to disbelieve that it has happened in your case.]]></description>

Not to be snarky, but math education is a deep area where thoughtful people have made real improvements in macro curriculum and micro technique. Even an enthusiastic and above-average-informed outsider is unlikely to know the current state of play or make a useful contribution. Sorry to be blunt, but I&#039;ve been there myself.

&lt;blockquote&gt; Bar charts, pie charts, dot charts, histograms, etc. can (and should!) be taught to young people.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
My (still young) kids encountered these things in school in 1st grade. Common core standards have these, and more, at grades 6 and 7.

I claim we &lt;b&gt;are&lt;/b&gt; good at teaching math, but we perceive that we aren&#039;t.

Why? I think three main reasons:
(1) Offsetting increased (absolute) achievement is that the yardsticks we use to measure performance aren&#039;t constant, they actually are getting more ambitious over time. (2) Math is used by our society (US/UK/SE Asia in my direct experience) as a filtering subject to separate &quot;smart&quot; vs &quot;not smart&quot; people, so the definition of &quot;good at math&quot; is always the ability of some percentile of the population (maybe 20ish), but then we are concerned that 80% of the population isn&#039;t &quot;good at math.&quot; (3) Some countries are just more collectively anxious than others, despite relative performance (cf. Singapore vs Thailand, former has higher performance and much higher anxiety).

Amongst the commentators here, Michael Pershan, half of the adversarial collaboration on gifted ed, is probably the best guide deeper into this subject.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/11/28/book-review-the-mind-illuminated/#comment-696084&quot;&gt;Aron Wall&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;And this experience arises in the context of a religious tradition that, as far as I can tell from the earliest source documents, was seeking Nirvana, which was believed to be something more akin to permanent cessation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The techniques for experiencing that state were originally developed in the context of such a religious tradition, but for any individual meditator, the experience arises in the context of whatever intellectual or philosophical system that they are interpreting it through. For me, the context is neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and contemporary philosophy of mind; and my goal is to internalize on an experiental level the things that I already know on an intellectual level from those fields, in order to be able to live more fully and engage better with the world.

Yes, you could use the techniques as an aid for renunciation and withdrawing from the world; but even within Buddhism, &lt;a HREF=&quot;http://arobuddhism.org/community/an-uncommon-perspective.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;that&#039;s just one approach&lt;/A&gt;; e.g. Buddhist tantra is more focused on engagement with the world, and &lt;a HREF=&quot;https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/BEw7E7Jgppgecoavo/looking-and-the-no-self/comment/gEoMTQ7ikKcob8iLK&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;some hold&lt;/A&gt; that you can get properly engaged with it &lt;i&gt;once&lt;/i&gt; you&#039;ve gotten enlightened in the renunciate sense. But where the renunciates go &quot;okay, the self doesn&#039;t exist, we&#039;re done and can now just withdraw&quot;, the tantrikas could go something like &quot;okay, so the self is more flexible than we could have ever realized; if we still &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to identify with the self, we can construct more interesting and fascinating ones for ourselves!&quot;

(If they can be bothered, because isn&#039;t it a bit boring to be so focused on the self when you could actually &lt;i&gt;be doing stuff&lt;/i&gt;? But still, AFAICT, enlightenment doesn&#039;t mean that you &lt;i&gt;couldn&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; identify with certain aspects of the self-construct if you so chose; it just liberates you to be able to choose exactly which aspects you &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to identify with. The renunciates choose to identify with none of them, because that&#039;s what their ideology tells them to; the tantrikas go with whatever forms of self that seem fun and useful to them.)

&lt;blockquote&gt;which does not require rewiring my brain until I am too depersonalized for it to hurt properly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You are free to make your own choices, of course, but &quot;too depersonalized for it to hurt properly&quot; is a very misleading description. 

I&#039;m not interested in trying to convert you or selling you on the experience, but I do feel like your first comment in particular was trying to warn people away from insight meditation based on a very limited and caricatured understanding of what the experience and end result is actually like. It&#039;s fine to be cautious and skeptical. It&#039;s another thing entirely to assume that you already know, and to use expressions like &quot;make yourself into the closest approximation available to a p-zombie&quot;, &quot;despair and hatred for life&quot;, and &quot;don’t murder your own soul&quot;. 

I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;ve experienced cessation myself (there was _something_ that could have been it a few days ago, and things have felt subtly different and better since then... but I could also just be me imagining things), but I personally know people who have, and the things that you say don&#039;t describe them; they are very clearly alive. And the insight experiences that I have had myself, while all (possibly?) falling short of cessation, have overall also made me much &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; alive; my soul was much &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; dead &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; I started meditating.

It&#039;s one thing to say &quot;this doesn&#039;t look like my thing, I want to stay away from it&quot;. If that is your stance towards insight meditation, then I completely support your decision. But please do not say &quot;nobody should try this thing&quot; on the basis of what you &lt;i&gt;imagine&lt;/i&gt; it to be, when there are many who have found it immensly valuable and enriching.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I also question the value of any “insight” which is obtained by entering some other form of consciousness X which is completely different from usual waking consciousness—if I do that maybe I have learned what X feels like, but by definition X is something very far from the normal operating conditions of the brain, so attempting to extrapolate from X to normal experience seems potentially fallacious.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is a consideration that seems hard to disagree with in general, but seems to have little relevance to the question of cessation in particular. It&#039;s not that we&#039;re learning something entirely new and unprecedented from cessation, and just have to rely on the inherent weirdness of that state as evidence; we &lt;i&gt;already&lt;/i&gt; know from science that we&#039;re living in a virtual reality constructed by our brains. Cessation just makes that understanding better available to the parts of our brain that can&#039;t be reached by language alone.]]></description>

<p>The techniques for experiencing that state were originally developed in the context of such a religious tradition, but for any individual meditator, the experience arises in the context of whatever intellectual or philosophical system that they are interpreting it through. For me, the context is neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and contemporary philosophy of mind; and my goal is to internalize on an experiental level the things that I already know on an intellectual level from those fields, in order to be able to live more fully and engage better with the world.</p>
<p>Yes, you could use the techniques as an aid for renunciation and withdrawing from the world; but even within Buddhism, <a HREF="http://arobuddhism.org/community/an-uncommon-perspective.html" rel="nofollow">that&#8217;s just one approach</a>; e.g. Buddhist tantra is more focused on engagement with the world, and <a HREF="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/BEw7E7Jgppgecoavo/looking-and-the-no-self/comment/gEoMTQ7ikKcob8iLK" rel="nofollow">some hold</a> that you can get properly engaged with it <i>once</i> you&#8217;ve gotten enlightened in the renunciate sense. But where the renunciates go &#8220;okay, the self doesn&#8217;t exist, we&#8217;re done and can now just withdraw&#8221;, the tantrikas could go something like &#8220;okay, so the self is more flexible than we could have ever realized; if we still <i>want</i> to identify with the self, we can construct more interesting and fascinating ones for ourselves!&#8221;</p>
<p>(If they can be bothered, because isn&#8217;t it a bit boring to be so focused on the self when you could actually <i>be doing stuff</i>? But still, AFAICT, enlightenment doesn&#8217;t mean that you <i>couldn&#8217;t</i> identify with certain aspects of the self-construct if you so chose; it just liberates you to be able to choose exactly which aspects you <i>want</i> to identify with. The renunciates choose to identify with none of them, because that&#8217;s what their ideology tells them to; the tantrikas go with whatever forms of self that seem fun and useful to them.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/11/28/book-review-the-mind-illuminated/#comment-695869&quot;&gt;Kaj Sotala&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks for your reply.  So despite my comment above, I do realize that the &quot;cessation state&quot; as reported above is normally temporary.  But as you say it is (believed to) lead to some sort of permanent psychological change in how we perceive reality.  And this experience arises in the context of a religious tradition that, as far as I can tell from the earliest source documents, was seeking Nirvana, which was believed to be something more akin to permanent cessation.  Now I think that this goal is well worth critiquing &lt;i&gt;as a goal&lt;/i&gt;, even if the techniques advocated actually fall short of implementing this goal.

Logically, it is possible that an experience of temporary cessation might be useful even from what I am tempted to call a &quot;pro-life&quot; perspective [not talking about abortion here], because of some practical benefit gained from the experience.  &quot;Have you tried turning your consciousness off and then on again?&quot;  Just as I go to sleep, not because I desire oblivion for its own sake, but because it will result in my consciousness the next day being more refreshed and awake.  I doubt, however, that this was the point of the experience of cessation as conceived by the earliest Buddhists.

In any case, the exprience of &quot;enlightenment&quot; &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; supposed to result in a permanent shift of perspective, and if this is so, we still need to ask if this shift is actually a good thing.  Is it the genetic fallacy to be especially suspicious of the value of this shift, given that it seems to have been discovered by spiritually suicidal people?  (Even if, perhaps, they may have discovered something quite different from the original advertising.)  Given this, I have strong doubts about whether the claimed shift is something that I would consider to be a good thing.  Yes, I admit intellectually that all of our experiences are probably, in some sense, &quot;constructed&quot; by the brain, but I deny that this makes them in any way unreal or unimportant, and I therefore wish to continue identifying with certain aspects of that construction as &quot;myself&quot;.  

Nor do I think that eliminating all suffering (or the aversion to it) ought to be anyone&#039;s primary goal in life.  Yes it is important to face certain kinds of suffering in order to live a full life, but I can do this with the virtue of courage, which does not require rewiring my brain until I am too depersonalized for it to hurt properly.  I hope this makes my position more clear.

I also question the value of any &quot;insight&quot; which is obtained by entering some other form of consciousness X which is completely different from usual waking consciousness---if I do that maybe I have learned what X feels like, but by definition X is something very far from the normal operating conditions of the brain, so attempting to extrapolate from X to normal experience seems potentially fallacious.  Sure, if you jump into a pool you become wet, but that doesn&#039;t mean there is no such thing as dryness and that your previous experience of being dry was some sort of illusion.]]></description>
