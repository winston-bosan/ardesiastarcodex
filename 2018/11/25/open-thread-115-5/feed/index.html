I once worked with a genius, in the sense that people here have heard of him, and he would produce this blob of code that perfectly solves the problem but no one is sure how of what the side-effects are, and he&#039;s too important to explain to the rest of the team how it works. &quot;Just read it!&quot;]]></description>

My claim directly follows from yours, so I don&#039;t see why you say it is incorrect.  A good programmer who cannot teach less-good programmers is not to be valued any more than those less-good programmers.

One of the goals of SEI-style software engineering is indeed to turn making software into a repeatable process that can be accomplished by anyone with the right 3-ring binders and the minimal intelligence and training required to follow the procedures therein.  There&#039;s no room for better or worse there; just follow the procedures.  Unless you have the skill to write a better procedure that anyone can follow, and the political acumen to get it implemented -- which is a very different thing from being a good programmer.]]></description>

Incorrect, and I suspect uncharitable.  Genius in programming ought to be respected and valued in roughly the same way that genius in science is respected and valued - when its results can be explained to mere mortals, and not before.]]></description>

Writing better code, and sometimes solving problems that less-good coders simply can&#039;t - but only if they the can and will &lt;i&gt;explain&lt;/i&gt; their work to the point where the lesser coders can fully understand it.  They also often make good teachers, and they can develop good standards and processes, but see above re explaining your work.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a huge difference between a “nuclear power” that has a handful of untested nuclear weapons it can’t admit to, and a nuclear power with an acknowledged and tested nuclear arsenal that has been integrated into its warfighting doctrine and its foreign policy. Yes, the nation with the small covert arsenal can try to “break out”, but that involves a period of extreme vulnerability not compatible with military adventurism. Consider South Africa 1977-1989. Consider Pakistan 1983-1998. Consider Israel in 1973, and maybe even today.

Or consider North Korea 1994-2009, vs North Korea today. JCPOA froze Iran at roughly North Korea 2005 levels, and was likely to do so for as long as it remained in force. How much would you give to be able to turn the clock on North Korea back to 2005 today, even if only for a couple of years?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of those Israel is easily the easiest to predict the nature of and its because they are a regional power and a nuclear power. South Africa has destabilized since denuclearizing (as did Libya) and is a general threat to stability in Africa currently. I don&#039;t consider NK any more dangerous now than in 2005, and Pakistan is fairly instable as well regardless of their ability to deploy. 

Thus, I don&#039;t think one can draw a useful pattern between nuclear progression and whether a country poses a destabilizing force. If anything, the trend is that we should abandon JCPOA for the explicit reason of encouraging Iran to become a fully nuclear state.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;I don’t want to assume the worst, but is this just a euphemism for the fact that node and javascript are accessible to amateurs, which leads to a lot of node packages being written by mediocre programmers? I feel like that’s a feature, not a bug.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The issue isn&#039;t whether code is being written by mediocre programmers.  The code coiuld be written by Stallman or Knuth.  The issue is how good is the process by which the code is reviewed by people who &lt;i&gt;didn&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; write it, to validate that it meets standards and requirements and doesn&#039;t have any of the well-known type of mistakes that even a Stallman or a Knuth can make if they having a sloppy/lazy/arrogant day.  Code written by mediocre programmers and reviewed by other mediocre programmers can be perfectly acceptable for the most critical applications, if the review process was put together by experienced veterans and if everybody understands that it&#039;s not optional.

Code written by a genius who says that everyone should incorporate it into their production code because a genius said it was OK, isn&#039;t.]]></description>
