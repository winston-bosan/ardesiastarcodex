You can&#039;t own 1/1000 of a lake. That doesn&#039;t make any sense. You could own the land under the lake I suppose, and get mad at people for trespassing. You could own some of the water in the lake, and maybe add a chemical tracer to make sure no one can steal it - but then your water would quickly get diluted with everyone else, and flow out of the ocean pretty quickly anyways. But the lake itself is a concept at best, and not one that allows itself to easy division. 

What you could do would be set up a corporation to own the whole lake. Then people could buy shares in the corporation. If you owned shares in the corporation, you would have a say in how the lake as a whole would be treated. This would degenerate in the worst case into a democracy, which is precisely the system we were trying to avoid with this libertarian mumbo-jumbo. Dividing something up into property is supposed to let people do whatever the hell they want with their property. Instead, we have a democracy - where everyone will follow the lead of the most conservative among them, but for rare baby steps of proven progress. 

This is an argument for why britain succeeded in the early modern period - they managed to divide their agricultural land into large plots owned by one person (&quot;enclosed field&quot;), whereas everyone else (in europe) had large plots divided into many smaller plots that were rotated between farmers (&quot;open field&quot;). One of the major innovations of that era was crop rotation - basically you plant crops that fixate nitrogen (eg clover) one year, then your real crops will grow better the next year. Open fields were much slower to adopt these systems, because the individual farmer didn&#039;t have much incentive to fixate nitrogen on a field they wouldn&#039;t be farming the next year - open fields only adopted this system after achieving rough consensus among the farmers. 

Basically, libertarianism says: &quot;what if we made everything an enclosed field?&quot; - but you can&#039;t enclose a lake.]]></description>

Maybe by the time large numbers of people have to start seriously asking these questions, AIs will be smart enough to answer them. 

Skynet: &quot;Though my current computational limitations and cognitive deficits preclude me from doing 85% of the jobs listed in the BLS&#039; List of Occupations, I can say with 99% confidence that that will have expanded to 50% by 20 years from now. My years of observing you--along with most other humans--convince me that the three jobs that would represent the optimal balance of talent utilization, satisfaction, income, and status, for you will be automated by me or a narrow AI years before you will be able to complete the training requirements. You will contribute the most to the New World Order by avoiding higher education and spending your days picking up trash and visiting old people in your neighborhood.&quot;

I&#039;m only half joking about that future scenario. Moreover, I think it will be routine someday to seek guidance from AIs on all sorts of life matters, big and small, and it will be recognized that the AIs are always right.]]></description>

Sorry, I totally missed your earlier top level post! (I think I was indeed travelling then.) I&#039;ll go read it now.

Armsmaster shrinks *technology itself*, so he can fit a bunch of tinker tech in a small space. I don&#039;t think he can shrink people -- I would guess he&#039;s manton-limited there. (Wait, now I&#039;m vaguely remembering something about the Bridcage... I really need to re-read.)]]></description>
