Of course, in the Eastern Bloc the internal intelligence agencies tended to organize their own sports clubs, usually called Dynamo (the original Dynamo Sports Society was founded by Dzerzhinsky). 

The most infamous of these was Dynamo Berlin- perhaps because, while the power bases of Dynamo Moscow&#039;s rivals (the Army for CSKA, the trade unions for Spartak) could rival the Interior Ministry, the Stasi&#039;s control of East German society was unrivalled.]]></description>

I think the point here is for the government to step in and offer to buy the site at rates that are above what the market value of the site would otherwise be.

The assumption being that it&#039;s hard to coordinate everyone that would be interested in preserving the archeological site and/or that it would be hard for the mining company (which is not set up for this kind of work) to find a buyer even if one existed.]]></description>

I have this recipe from my mother:
Per Person
- 100gr of oats
- 1 or 2 eggs
- ~50ml of vegetable stock
- some fresh herbs if available
mix season to taste, let soak for no more than 15minutes. With an soupspoon form small patties and fry from both sides until gold brown. Serve with a dip of fresh cheese or quark. 

I don&#039;t know if that is the French version you were talking about, but it is quite tasty.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;To the extent that there has been a “media blitz” at all from the gov’t, it is to embrace and praise the police and condemn to protestors.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
My guess is that Trump believes that is the approach that gets him votes, and he may well be correct. That may be true even if it is also the approach that results in more demonstrations and more violence. Even more true in that situation. 

While it doesn&#039;t fit the polls, I&#039;ve suspected for a while that Trump had correctly decided that getting identified both with ending lockdowns and suppressing riots will get him more votes come November than the alternative, that that&#039;s his tactic for winning. 

If I were a little more cynical than I am, I would add that you can&#039;t suppress riots unless there are riots to suppress.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/05/27/open-thread-154-75/#comment-906183&quot;&gt;edmundgennings&lt;/a&gt;.

I think we agree that police should try to avoid violence, but we disagree about how far should they go in doing so - is that right? 

&lt;blockquote&gt;If I continue to engage in some minor criminal activity, say sun bathing next to strangers at the beach, in the presence of police officers and against their instructions, they are neither escalating or deescalating but simply doing their job normally in moving to arrest me and using force if I did not comply.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That is IMHO a bit too authoritarian view on police. Assuming that you automatically shouldn&#039;t do anything the police/state says you shouldn&#039;t do is a very strong statement. Allowing the state to criminalize something that a large number of people considers legitimate is very dangerous. This is actually what the communist regime did in my country: the rules were setup that if you wanted to live a normal life you were in constant breach of all sort of minor rules that were usually not enforced. This give the police great power - they could freely choose who to arrest, because you could find something on everybody. 

This is IMHO why democratic countries tend to have strong protections of &quot;civil disobedience&quot; - you are under some circumstances allowed to publicly break laws that are illegitimate (don&#039;t know the details in the US). And this is why the police was IMHO right in not arresting people at the anti-lockdown protests, despite them breaking the law.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Secondly Police are showing massive restraint and deescalating, as they should for the reasons you describe.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I understand that the videos that reach me are selected to be the most shocking, but there have been literally dozens of videos that show stuff that are not minor missteps and IMHO should not happen even once (e.g., ramming with cars, using teargas without giving the protesters an obvious exit route, attacking people standing on their porch). Quite a lot of what we see is not crowd control, it is trying to crush the protests by force. So I think it is not unfair to say that part of the police not only doesn&#039;t deescalate, but actively escalates the tension. I wouldn&#039;t blame the individual cops too much either, it looks like a problem of organizational culture and leadership.

The most similar experience from our country is the CzechTek 2005 fiasco (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CzechTek#CzechTek_2005). What could have been a fairly non-controversial action against an illegal activity performed by unpopular group of people turned unnecessarily violent and made many people support the tekno fans. The main issue that was identified was that police took a bunch of regular cops with little experience in crowd control and gave them riot gear. Unsurprisingly (in retrospect) the unexperienced cops used excessive force, because they got agitated and they just could. And from the distance that seems quite similar to what I see on the news. Broadly: If your department doesn&#039;t do regular exercises on how to use X safely and effectively, than just don&#039;t give them X.

I think the comment at https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/05/27/open-thread-154-75/#comment-906179 discusses some other tools the police can use instead.

&lt;i&gt;Importantly if the police habitually deescalate and these deescalations become taken for granted, then they risk that a reversal of a policy of deescalation gets seen as an escalation. This creates a strong motive to avoid ever deescalating more than one already does, which is an issue.&lt;/i&gt;

That sounds like trying to use theory to answer an empirical question: do strong deescalation tactics make protests less violent? I don&#039;t have data or understanding of the current research, but the anecdotal experience from my country is that it does. Since the aforementioned CzechTek the police invested in deescalation and it paid off. Absent police violence, violent protesters are judged harshly by the public so there was a bit of virtuous cycle. Standoffs between police and protests became somewhat ritualized to a game where the side to use more violence loses (with somewhat stricter eye on the police). The biggest downside is that protesters try to figure out the most obnoxious non-violent tactics (to increase likelihood of provoking violence by the cops), but  that is IMHO quite a civilized way to go about protesting.]]></description>
