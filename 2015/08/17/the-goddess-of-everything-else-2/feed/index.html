					<description><![CDATA[Please if you could, explain to me what it means to call yulrseof a Unitarian Universalist?

Of course, I agree that a functioning society permits specialization. However, I think the thing to fear about becoming the Borg isn&#039;t necessarily their physical homogeneity; it&#039;s the single-minded-ness of their purpose. The Borg don&#039;t have individual aspirations, any more than the cells in your body. Currently, our society has mechanisms for leveraging &quot;individual aspirations&quot; that get people to specialize in useful/productive ways. But there are a lot of problems and inefficiencies associated with this (see every remotely marxist critique of capitalism ever). I brought up the borg because they most clearly embody &quot;single minded collaboration&quot;, though I&#039;ll certainly concede that &quot;homogeneous zombie cyborg&quot; is probably not the aesthetic that scaled-up collaboration would take.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Are there any other identifications that people are allowed to impose on others in defiance of facts?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You seem to be insisting that the shape of someone&#039;s genitals are the only relevant &quot;fact&quot; in determining someone&#039;s gender. To me, the invisible-to-the-senses configuration of the brain (and other body parts that may be affecting or being affected, such as finger ratio) is &lt;i&gt;far&lt;/i&gt; more important, to my concept of their identity, than what their genitals look like. As I am monogamous and not a member of the medical profession, I have no reason or desire to see their genitals! They do not matter to me! And gender is, as we are learning by inference from other cultures&#039; transgender and third-gender institutions and traditions, and directly from our evolving understanding of the &lt;b&gt;facts&lt;/b&gt; of the biological mechanisms underlying gender identity.  Your question is thus, to me, completely nonsensical.

I think we are too far apart to make any progress in this discussion, so I&#039;ll leave you with this quote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The role of gender in society is the most complicated thing I’ve ever spent a lot of time learning about, and I’ve spent a lot of time learning about quantum mechanics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Probably a matter of who invests most resources no matter who carries the eggs, I can think of an insect species where the males provide the females with a high-energy gel where, again, the females are the ones who compete for the males.]]></description>

@ Mary

Well, most people can&#039;t help fretting over the shape of their genitals. Declaring that trans people are forbidden to have such emotions would be rather discriminatory. 

Ah, that&#039;s a nice example. Making people with celiac disease eat bread would endanger their health, so we don&#039;t do it, regardless of what we believe about the bread&#039;s essence. Making transwomen use men&#039;s bathrooms would endanger their health, so -- we shouldn&#039;t do that either?  :)]]></description>

&quot;To say “No, I know what pronouns you should be referred to, and your comfort and identity don’t matter to me” is a much more aggressive statement than “I identify as a woman, please refer to me as such.”&quot;

On what grounds do you make that assertion?

Are there any other identifications that people are allowed to impose on others in defiance of facts?]]></description>

&quot;And surely, as long as we’re classifying attributes into accidents and essences, one’s gender is essential, and the shape of one’s genitals merely accidental?&quot;

Tell it to the &quot;trans&quot;, that they should not fret over accidents, and furthermore should comply with being treated according to them wherever relevant.  (Similar to people with celiac disease receiving only the cup.)]]></description>
