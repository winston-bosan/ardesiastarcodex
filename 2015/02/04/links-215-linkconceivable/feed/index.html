As shown in the BCSE slides I linked from my main post, PV solar is not doubling every two years. It&#039;s growing by about 70% every two years, so its doubling time is a bit under three years. Also, it’s anybody’s guess how long the growth curve will remain exponential, or if it’s already leveled off.]]></description>

Obviously, some geographies are better for solar than others. It seems like it would be better to build it first in the best places to figure out how it works before extending to marginal places. Germany does not seem to me like a good place for solar, but the German Green Party can&#039;t install solar in Spain. Similarly, America has subsidies for solar in Blue states, which mostly seem like lousy choices. I think the most subsidies are in New Jersey. California is great, though.

Obviously, the further south and the fewer clouds, the more energy from solar. Dry climates have few clouds. But wet climates have another problem, which is that the water holds heat and so decouples heat from direct irradiation. So maybe solar is perfectly aligned with peak demand in Spain and California, but not in Germany and New Jersey. But it is certainly better than a random source like wind.

Ryan, this is very misleading:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This of course means twice the CO2 emissions. These emissions are also not accounted for as emissions from wind/solar generation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If solar requires more peaking plants, then of course solar should be blamed for the cost of those plants. But that is a capital cost. The pollution from an additional peaking plant is negligible because the peaking plant almost never runs, I point you yourself mention in the follow-up. So the inefficiency of the peaking plants is irrelevant. (But building the plant may itself cause pollution.)]]></description>

@ryan, agreed. A couple of things to add. First, negative LMPs were actually common in the US last time I looked, too. They happen at night. I&#039;ve seen prices as low as -$60 per megawatt hour, which meant you could earn a lot of money by hooking up a big resistor to the grid. (I should look again. Last time I looked was a couple of years ago.)

Second, at least some ISOs (like CAISO) pay direct compensation for load-following capacity, much as they do for black start capacity, rather than relying entirely on the LMP market incentives.]]></description>

No, it&#039;s doesn&#039;t say that hydro can&#039;t provide load-following. On the contrary, it describes it as &quot;excellent.&quot; What it say can&#039;t is &quot;run of river&quot; hydro, which can&#039;t, pretty much by definition.]]></description>

@Furrfu

Meh, call it &quot;not as impossible as it sounds&quot; maybe?  

I&#039;d love to see papers on utility plans for plant construction as well.  It would be the very best evidence.   

Yes the real gigantic advantage of solar is that its peak in output logically (and as far as I know empirically) correlates with peak demand.  Most of the time.  It&#039;s the rest of the time that worries me (say if we start scuttling peaker plants because the sun has been shining very consistently lately, then clouds decide to be unpredictable again and we end up with brownouts).  

Wind on the other hand empirically tends to anti-correlate with demand, as crazy as that sounds.  At least in Texas anyway:

http://www.ercot.com/gridinfo/generation/windintegration/

They do a report of wind generation over time in various pdf&#039;s.  So on the issue of peaker plant construction plans I would expect wind power to have a larger effect (if any effect is observed).  

One other issue about the correlation of solar generation and peak demand is the second order effect it will have on peaker plant economics.  The spot price of electricity spikes with afternoon demand, and the peaker plants sort of rely on it being much higher than normal prices.  It&#039;s already hard for it to be profitable to build a power plant that in extreme cases may only operate 3 hours a day for 14 days every year.   I&#039;ve seen instances in Germany where solar ramps up so much that the spot price of electricity actually approaches negative territory.  It&#039;s hard to tell if they can deal with that competition.  

What we really need is for Commander LeForge to finish whipping up the low cost high capacity storage device he&#039;s working on.  Then it&#039;s all gravy.]]></description>

&lt;a href=&quot;http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/02/04/links-215-linkconceivable/#comment-182670&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;As I&#039;ve argued above&lt;/a&gt;, it seems likely that &lt;b&gt;solar PV will decrease demand on dispatchable capacity&lt;/b&gt;, even though it is not itself dispatchable. I&#039;m skeptical of the claims to the contrary in the blog post you linked because ⓐ it doesn&#039;t give any concrete cost numbers from actual ISO/RTO planning for dispatchable capacity in the face of increased solar PV, although those should be available by now and are public; ⓑ it claims that hydroelectric power can’t provide load-following, while in actual fact the ramp-up time for hydroelectric turbines is measured in seconds, faster even than the minutes needed for simple-cycle gas peakers. This total inversion of reality makes me think &lt;b&gt;“All Megawatts are Not Equal”’s author knows even less than I do about the power grid&lt;/b&gt;.

Getting more down-to-earth, I&#039;ve experienced a lot of power outages in the last couple of years: one this morning in a community center where I volunteer, one a couple of weeks ago in my apartment building, and several over the last year or two, including one in my house that lasted three weeks and led to my neighbors marching in the streets. (My entire neighborhood smelled like rotting corpses for a week, because everyone had to throw away the meat that had been in their refrigerators.) &lt;b&gt;Every single one of these blackouts was a result of inadequate distribution capacity.&lt;/b&gt; Generation and transmission are able to meet demand, but the distribution infrastructure is underbuilt and poorly maintained. The vast majority of blackouts I&#039;ve experienced in my life, in middle- and upper-income countries, have been results not of grid instability but of failures of local distribution. I also lived through the 2001 rolling blackouts in California, which were failures not of system capacity but rather of politics and dysregulated energy markets. The majority of large-scale blackouts that I have heard about during my lifetime, none of which have I experienced personally, have been results of failures of transmission, not generation or distribution.

To state what I hope is obvious, photovoltaic generation reduces the load on transmission infrastructure and decentralizes power; distributed photovoltaic additionally reduces the load on distribution infrastructure and the impact of a distribution blackout; &lt;b&gt;PV should therefore reduce the risk of transmission, distribution, and political blackouts&lt;/b&gt;, which are orders of magnitude more common at present than the grid instability problems you&#039;re worried about due to PV&#039;s poorer load-following capacity. There are people whose job it is to worry about grid instability (a rather surprising number of them, if you aren&#039;t familiar with the industry), they are doing a great job at preventing it, and even if PV turns out to make their jobs harder (as you suggest) rather than easier (as I have argued), it will take a really major change before the new unreliability outweighs the existing unreliability from the other sources I&#039;ve called out above. I say, let them freak out for now, and &lt;b&gt;worry about the problem in five years&lt;/b&gt;, at which point the US will have 40 or 50 GW of photovoltaic capacity installed, about 3–5% of the total. That&#039;s the point at which we can start budgeting for new peaker plants if it turns out they&#039;re actually needed at all.]]></description>

&lt;b&gt;24000 deaths per year from coal is absolutely plausible.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/2004_report_update/en/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lower respiratory infections killed 59800 people&lt;/a&gt; in the US in 2002, and trachea, bronchus; lung cancers killed 157,700; and other respiratory diseases killed 182,500. What fraction of those 400,000 deaths are from coal pollution (including coal pollution that hasn&#039;t been in the air since 1975, but which is still killing people)? It&#039;s easy to believe more than 6%. And respiratory insufficiency is a risk factor in many aspects of mortality, including heart attacks, and also both death from anesthesia and death from things that you could have cured with surgery if the doctors didn&#039;t think anesthesia were an unacceptable risk for you.

That&#039;s because, in the US, most of the outdoor air pollution is no longer due to coal-fired power plants.]]></description>

<p><b>24000 deaths per year from coal is absolutely plausible.</b> <a href="http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/2004_report_update/en/" rel="nofollow">Lower respiratory infections killed 59800 people</a> in the US in 2002, and trachea, bronchus; lung cancers killed 157,700; and other respiratory diseases killed 182,500. What fraction of those 400,000 deaths are from coal pollution (including coal pollution that hasn&#8217;t been in the air since 1975, but which is still killing people)? It&#8217;s easy to believe more than 6%. And respiratory insufficiency is a risk factor in many aspects of mortality, including heart attacks, and also both death from anesthesia and death from things that you could have cured with surgery if the doctors didn&#8217;t think anesthesia were an unacceptable risk for you.
