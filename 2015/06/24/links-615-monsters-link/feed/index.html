This is an excellent article.  I recommend it to everyone here, and hope Scott at least adds it to his next links post.

How did you come across it?]]></description>

Well, they have now &lt;a href=&quot;http://googleresearch.blogspot.no/2015/07/deepdream-code-example-for-visualizing.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;open sourced it&lt;/a&gt;.

I don&#039;t know how much that helps in understanding it, but it&#039;s cool anyway!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[An article that Scott and others might appreciate:

&lt;a href=&quot;http://induecourse.ca/on-the-problem-of-normative-sociology/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;On the problem of normative sociology&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Incidentally, “normative sociology” doesn’t necessarily have a left-wing bias. There are lots of examples of conservatives doing it as well (e.g. rising divorce rates must be due to tolerance of homosexuality, out-of-wedlock births must be caused by the welfare system etc.) The difference is that people on the left are often more keen on solving various social problems, and so they have a set of pragmatic interests at play that can strongly bias judgement. The latter case is particularly frustrating, because if the plan is to solve some social problem by attacking its causal antecedents, then it is really important to get the causal connections right – otherwise your intervention is going to prove useless, and quite possibly counterproductive.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I recall marvelling at how seldom I had heard this idea expressed: that the left consistently gets it right when it comes to identifying problems, but then gets the explanations wrong (and often clings to those explanations long after they have proven problematic), and so is practically ineffective.&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

@HeelBearCub: There&#039;s only one (former) head of government that can speak with authority on matters of nuclear engineering, and he &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engology.com/engpg5ajimmycarter.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;isn&#039;t Japanese.&lt;/a&gt;  &quot;Ten Chernobyls&quot; is at least 99.9% hyperbole.

What made Chernobyl such a nightmare is that the Russian RBMK-1000 reactor was basically made out of coal, and housed in a building without a roof.  Well, OK, graphite rather than coal, and there was enough structure up top to keep out the rain, but same difference.  Carbon doesn&#039;t melt, so if the reactor overheats, the options are limited to A: catch fire and B: vaporize.  And with no containment roof, pretty much the entire radioactive core of the reactor is free to disperse across the landscape as smoke and ash.

But &lt;strike&gt;coal&lt;/strike&gt;graphite-moderated reactors are basically used to breed plutonium for nuclear weapons; the RMBK-1000 was a dual-purpose design, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windscale_fire&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;not the first&lt;/a&gt; graphite-moderated reactor to go bad.  Fukushima, and pretty much every other pure power-generating reactor, was A: built of metal and metal oxides, B: used water as a moderator as well as a coolant (hence, nuclear reaction cannot continue if water level drops), and C: was fully enclosed by a meter or more of steel and reinforced concrete.

Metals and metal oxides melt before they burn or vaporize.  And they can&#039;t melt while there is still liquid water present; takes a &lt;b&gt;lot&lt;/b&gt; of energy to boil a reactor&#039;s worth of water.   And even when all this happens, there&#039;s all that steel and concrete.

With first- and second-generation reactors, at least, it&#039;s possible to daisy-chain failures so that the molten core breaches the containment structure.  But gravity still works, meaning that the radioactive core winds up as a blob of slag buried underground with a meter of steel and concrete as a cap.  And maybe some radioactive steam gets vented early in the process, and maybe ground water can get at the buried core and leach away some radioisotopes, but even in the worst case that&#039;s not going to be even a tenth as bad as Chernobyl, never mind ten times as bad.

Nuclear power generation is as safe as you can hope for in any power source so long as you don&#039;t do mind-bogglingly stupid things like building the reactors out of coal, or not putting a roof on the containment structure.  Or experimenting with &quot;what happens if we turn off the primary power supply to the coolant pumps for our nuclear reactor made of coal?&quot;, but really you lost me at &quot;made of coal&quot;.]]></description>

@John Schilling:

Fukushima could have been much, much worse, right? I believe the Japanese Prime Minister said it had the possibility of being 10 Chernobyls (although I think that was predicated on all the reactors melting down, but I think that was a possibility if #4 did melt).

Yes, they managed to get it under control. But it definitely was not a sure thing in the early going.]]></description>
