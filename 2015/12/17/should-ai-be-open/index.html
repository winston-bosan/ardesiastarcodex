						<p><b>I.</b></p>
<p>H.G. Wells&#8217; 1914 sci-fi book <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Set_Free"><i>The World Set Free</i></A> did a pretty good job predicting nuclear weapons:</p>
<blockquote><p>They did not see it until the atomic bombs burst in their fumbling hands&#8230;before the last war began it was a matter of common knowledge that a man could carry about in a handbag an amount of latent energy sufficient to wreck half a city</p></blockquote>
<p>Wells believed the coming atomic bombs would be so deadly that we would inevitably create a utopian one-world government to prevent them from ever being used. Sorry, Wells. It was a nice thought.</p>
<p>But imagine that in the 1910s and 1920s, some elites had started thinking really seriously along Wellsian lines. They would worry about what might happen when the first nation &#8211; let&#8217;s say America &#8211; got the Bomb. It would be unstoppable in battle and might rule the world with an iron fist. Such a situation would be the end of human freedom and progress.</p>
<p>So in 1920, these elites pooled their resources and made their own Manhattan Project. Their efforts bore fruit, and they learned a lot about nuclear fission; in particular, they learned that uranium was a necessary raw material. The world&#8217;s uranium sources were few enough that a single nation or coalition could get a monopoly upon them; the specter of atomic despotism seemed more worrying than ever.</p>
<p>They got their physicists working overtime and discovered a new type of nuke that required no uranium at all. In fact, once you understood the principles you could build one out of parts from a Model T engine. The only downside was that if you didn&#8217;t build it <i>exactly right</i>, its usual failure mode was to detonate on the workbench in an uncontrolled hyper-reaction that would blow the entire hemisphere to smithereens.</p>
<p>And so the intellectual and financial elites declared victory &#8211; no one country could monopolize atomic weapons <i>now</I> &#8211; and sent step-by-step guides to building a Model T nuke to every household in the world. Within a week, both hemispheres were blown to very predictable smithereens.</p>
<p><b>II.</b></p>
<p>Some of the top names in Silicon Valley have just announced a new organization, <A HREF="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/">OpenAI</A>, dedicated to &#8220;advancing digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole&#8230;as broadly and evenly distributed as possible.&#8221; Co-chairs Elon Musk and Sam Altman <A HREF="https://medium.com/backchannel/how-elon-musk-and-y-combinator-plan-to-stop-computers-from-taking-over-17e0e27dd02a#.eln6ili1w">talk to</A> Steven Levy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Levy:</b> How did this come about? [&#8230;]</p>
<p><b>Musk:</b> Philosophically there’s an important element here: we want AI to be widespread. There’s two schools of thought?—?do you want many AIs, or a small number of AIs? We think probably many is good. And to the degree that you can tie it to an extension of individual human will, that is also good. [&#8230;]</p>
<p><b>Altman:</b> We think the best way AI can develop is if it’s about individual empowerment and making humans better, and made freely available to everyone, not a single entity that is a million times more powerful than any human. Because we are not a for-profit company, like a Google, we can focus not on trying to enrich our shareholders, but what we believe is the actual best thing for the future of humanity.</p>
<p><b>Levy</b>: Couldn’t your stuff in OpenAI surpass human intelligence?</p>
<p><b>Altman:</b> I expect that it will, but it will just be open source and useable by everyone instead of useable by, say, just Google. Anything the group develops will be available to everyone. If you take it and repurpose it you don’t have to share that. But any of the work that we do will be available to everyone.</p>
<p><b>Levy:</b> If I’m Dr. Evil and I use it, won’t you be empowering me?</p>
<p><b>Musk:</b> I think that’s an excellent question and it’s something that we debated quite a bit.</p>
<p><b>Altman:</b> There are a few different thoughts about this. Just like humans protect against Dr. Evil by the fact that most humans are good, and the collective force of humanity can contain the bad elements, we think its far more likely that many, many AIs, will work to stop the occasional bad actors than the idea that there is a single AI a billion times more powerful than anything else. If that one thing goes off the rails or if Dr. Evil gets that one thing and there is nothing to counteract it, then we’re really in a bad place.</p></blockquote>
<p>Both sides here keep talking about who is going to &#8220;use&#8221; the superhuman intelligence a billion times more powerful than humanity, as if it were a microwave or something. Far be it from me to claim to know more than Musk or Altman about anything, but I propose that the correct answer to &#8220;what would you do if Dr. Evil used superintelligent AI?&#8221; is &#8220;cry tears of joy and declare victory&#8221;, because <i>anybody at all</i> having a usable level of control over the first superintelligence is so much more than we have any right to expect that I&#8217;m prepared to accept the presence of a medical degree and ominous surname.</p>
<p>A more <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bostrom#Superintelligence">Bostromian</A> view would forget about Dr. Evil, and model AI progress as a race between Dr. Good and Dr. Amoral. Dr. Good is anyone who understands that improperly-designed AI could get out of control and destroy the human race &#8211; and who is willing to test and fine-tune his AI however long it takes to be truly confident in its safety. Dr. Amoral is anybody who doesn&#8217;t worry about that and who just wants to go forward as quickly as possible in order to be the first one with a finished project. If Dr. Good finishes an AI first, we get a good AI which protects human values. If Dr. Amoral finishes an AI first, we get an AI with no concern for humans that will probably cut short our future.</p>
<p>Dr. Amoral has a clear advantage in this race: building an AI without worrying about its behavior beforehand is faster and easier than building an AI and spending years testing it and making sure its behavior is stable and beneficial. He will win any fair fight. The hope has always been that the fight won&#8217;t be fair, because all the smartest AI researchers will realize the stakes and join Dr. Good&#8217;s team.</p>
<p>Open-source AI crushes that hope. Suppose Dr. Good and his team discover all the basic principles of AI but wisely hold off on actually instantiating a superintelligence until they can do the necessary testing and safety work. But suppose they <i>also</i> release what they&#8217;ve got on the Internet. Dr. Amoral downloads the plans, sticks them in his supercomputer, flips the switch, and then &#8211; <A HREF="http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/Good65ultraintelligent.pdf">as Dr. Good himself put it back in 1963</A> &#8211; &#8220;the human race has become redundant.&#8221;</p>
<p>The decision to make AI findings open source is a tradeoff between risks and benefits. The risk is letting the most careless person in the world determine the speed of AI research &#8211; because everyone will always have the option to exploit the full power of existing AI designs, and the most careless person in the world will always be the first one to take it. The benefit is that in a world where intelligence progresses very slowly and AIs are easily controlled, nobody can use their sole possession of the only existing AI to garner too much power.</p>
<p>But what if we don&#8217;t live in a world where progress is slow and control is easy?</p>
<p><b>III.</b></p>
<p>If AI saunters lazily from infrahuman to human to superhuman, then we&#8217;ll probably end up with a lot of more-or-less equally advanced AIs that we can tweak and fine-tune until they cooperate well with us. In this situation, we have to worry about who controls those AIs, and it is here that OpenAI&#8217;s model makes the most sense.</p>
<p>But Bostrom et al worry that AI won&#8217;t work like this at all. Instead there could be a &#8220;hard takeoff&#8221;, a subjective discontinuity in the function mapping AI research progress to intelligence as measured in ability-to-get-things-done. If on January 1 you have a toy AI as smart as a cow, and on February 1 it&#8217;s proved the Riemann hypothesis and started building a ring around the sun, that was a hard takeoff.</p>
<p>(I won&#8217;t have enough space here to really do these arguments justice, so I once again suggest reading Bostrom&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/0199678111/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=0199678111&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=slastacod-20&#038;linkId=4URA6TKVO7KPRWXD"><i>Superintelligence</i></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=slastacod-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=0199678111" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> if you haven&#8217;t already. For more on what AI researchers themselves think of these ideas, see <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/22/ai-researchers-on-ai-risk/">AI Researchers On AI Risk</A>.)</p>
<p>Why should we expect a hard takeoff? First, it&#8217;s happened before. It took evolution twenty million years to go from cows with sharp horns to hominids with sharp spears; it took only a few tens of thousands of years to go from hominids with sharp spears to moderns with nuclear weapons. Almost all of the practically interesting differences in intelligence occur within a tiny window that you could blink and miss. </p>
<p>If you were to invent a sort of objective zoological IQ based on amount of evolutionary work required to reach a certain level, complexity of brain structures, etc, you might put nematodes at 1, cows at 90, chimps at 99, homo erectus at 99.9, and modern humans at 100. The difference between 99.9 and 100 is the difference between &#8220;frequently eaten by lions&#8221; and &#8220;has to pass anti-poaching laws to prevent all lions from being wiped out&#8221;.</p>
<p>Worse, the reasons we humans aren&#8217;t more intelligent are <i>really stupid</i>. Even people who find the idea abhorrent agree that selectively breeding humans for intelligence would work in some limited sense. Find all the smartest people, make them marry each other for a couple of generations, and you&#8217;d get some really smart great-grandchildren. But think about how weird this is! Breeding smart people isn&#8217;t doing <i>work</i>, per se. It&#8217;s not inventing complex new brain lobes. If you want to get all anthropomorphic about it, you&#8217;re just &#8220;telling&#8221; evolution that intelligence is something it should be selecting for. Heck, that&#8217;s all that the African savannah was doing too &#8211; the difference between chimps and humans isn&#8217;t some brilliant new molecular mechanism, it&#8217;s just sticking chimps in an environment where intelligence was selected for so that evolution was incentivized to pull out a few stupid hacks. The hacks seem to be things like &#8220;bigger brain size&#8221; (did you know that both among species and among individual humans, brain size <A HREF="https://neuroscience.stanford.edu/news/ask-neuroscientist-does-bigger-brain-make-you-smarter">correlates</A> pretty robustly with intelligence, and that one reason we&#8217;re not smarter may be that it&#8217;s too hard to squeeze a bigger brain through the birth canal?) If you believe in Greg Cochran&#8217;s <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/fustflum/documents/papers/AshkenaziIQ.jbiosocsci.pdf">Ashkenazi IQ hypothesis</A>, just having a culture that valued intelligence on the marriage market was enough to boost IQ 15 points in a couple of centuries, and this is exactly the sort of thing you should expect in a world like ours where intelligence increases are stupidly easy to come by.</p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s a certain level of hard engineering/design work that needs to be done for intelligence, a level <i>way</i> below humans, and after that the limits on intelligence are less about novel discoveries and more about tradeoffs like &#8220;how much brain can you cram into a head big enough to fit out a birth canal?&#8221; or &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t having faster-growing neurons <A HREF="http://www.futurepundit.com/archives/003694.html">increase your cancer risk</A>?&#8221; Computers are not known for having to fit through birth canals or getting cancer, so it may be that AI researchers only have to develop a few basic principles &#8211; let&#8217;s say enough to make cow-level intelligence &#8211; and after that the road to human intelligence runs through adding the line NumberOfNeuronsSimulated = 100000000000 to the code, and the road to superintelligence runs through adding another zero after that. </p>
<p>(Remember, it took all of human history from Mesopotamia to 19th-century Britain to invent <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_speed_record_for_rail_vehicles">a vehicle</A> that could go as fast as a human. But after that it only took another four years to build one that could go twice as fast as a human.)</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s a hard takeoff, OpenAI&#8217;s strategy stops being useful. There&#8217;s no point in ensuring that everyone has their own AIs, because there&#8217;s not much time between the first useful AI and the point at which things get too confusing to model and nobody &#8220;has&#8221; the AIs at all.</p>
<p><b>IV.</b></p>
<p>OpenAI&#8217;s strategy also skips over a second aspect of AI risk: the control problem.</p>
<p>All of this talk of &#8220;will big corporations use AI?&#8221; or &#8220;will Dr. Evil use AI?&#8221; or &#8220;Will AI be used for the good of all?&#8221; presuppose that you can <i>use</i> an AI. You can certainly use an AI like the ones in chess-playing computers, but nobody&#8217;s very scared of the AIs in chess-playing computers either. What about AIs powerful enough to be scary?</p>
<p>Remember the classic programmers&#8217; complaint: computers always do what you <i>tell</i> them to do instead of what you <i>meant</i> for them to do. Computer programs rarely do what you want the first time you test them. Google Maps has a relatively simple task (plot routes between Point A and Point B), has been perfected over the course of years by the finest engineers at Google, has been &#8216;playtested&#8217; by tens of millions of people day after day, and <i>still</i> occasionally <A HREF="http://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/10-dumbest-google-map-fails.html">does awful things</A> like suggest you drive over the edge of a deadly cliff, or tell you to walk across an ocean and back for no reason on your way to the corner store.</p>
<p>Humans have a robust neural architecture, to the point where you can logically prove that what they&#8217;re doing is suboptimal and they&#8217;ll shrug and say they they&#8217;re going to do it anyway. Computers aren&#8217;t like this unless we make them so, itself a hard task. They are naturally fragile and oriented toward specific goals. An AI that ended up with a drive as perverse as Google Maps&#8217; occasional tendency to hurl you off cliffs would not be necessarily self-correcting. A smart AI might be able to figure out that humans didn&#8217;t mean for it to have the drive it did. But that wouldn&#8217;t cause it to change its drive, any more than you can convert a gay person to heterosexuality by patiently explaining to them that evolution probably didn&#8217;t <i>mean</i> for them to be gay. Your drives are your drives, whether they are intentional or not.</p>
<p>When Google Maps tells people to drive off cliffs, Google quietly patches the program. AIs that are more powerful than us may not need to accept our patches, and may actively take action to prevent us from patching them. If an alien species showed up in their UFOs, said that they&#8217;d created us but made a mistake and actually we were supposed to eat our children, and asked us to line up so they could insert the functioning child-eating gene in us, we would probably go all <i>Independence Day</i> on them; computers with more goal-directed architecture would if anything be even more willing to fight such changes.</p>
<p>If it really is a quick path from cow-level AI to superhuman-level AI, it would be really hard to test the cow-level AI for stability and expect it to stay stable all the way up to superhuman-level &#8211; superhumans have a lot more ways to cause trouble than cows do. That means a serious risk of superhuman AIs that want to do the equivalent of hurl us off cliffs, and which are very resistant to us removing that desire from them. We may be able to prevent this, but it would require a lot of deep thought and a lot of careful testing and prodding at the cow-level AIs to make sure they are as prepared as possible for the transition to superhumanity. </p>
<p>And we lose that option by making the AI open source. Make such a program universally available, and while Dr. Good is busy testing and prodding, Dr. Amoral has already downloaded the program, flipped the switch, and away we go.</p>
<p><b>V.</b></p>
<p>Once again: The decision to make AI findings open source is a tradeoff between risks and benefits. The risk is that in a world with hard takeoffs and difficult control problems, you get superhuman AIs that hurl everybody off cliffs. The benefit is that in a world with slow takeoffs and no control problems, nobody will be able to use their sole possession of the only existing AI to garner too much power.</p>
<p>But the benefits just aren&#8217;t clear enough to justify that level of risk. I&#8217;m still not even sure exactly how the OpenAI founders visualize the future they&#8217;re trying to prevent. Are AIs fast and dangerous? Are they slow and easily-controlled? Does just one company have them? Several companies? All rich people? Are they a moderate advantage? A huge advantage? None of those possibilities seem dire enough to justify OpenAI&#8217;s tradeoff against safety.</p>
<p>Are we worried that AI will be dominated by one company despite becoming necessary for almost every computing application? Microsoft Windows is dominated by one company and became necessary for almost every computing application. For a while people were genuinely terrified that Microsoft would exploit its advantage to become a monopolistic giant that took over the Internet and something something something. Instead, they were caught flat-footed and outcompeted by Apple and Google, plus if you really want you can use something open-source like Linux instead. And new versions of Windows inevitably end up hacked and up on The Pirate Bay anyway.</p>
<p>Or are we worried that AIs will somehow help the rich get richer and the poor get poorer? This is a weird concern to have about a piece of software which can be replicated pretty much for free. Windows and Google Search are both fantastically complex products of millions of man-hours of research; Google is free and Windows comes bundled with your computer. In fact, people have gone through the trouble of creating fantastically complex competitors to both and providing <i>those</i> free of charge, to the point where multiple groups are competing to offer people fantastically complex software for free. While it&#8217;s possible that rich people will be able to afford premium AIs, it is hard for me to weigh &#8220;rich people get premium versions of things&#8221; on the same scale as &#8220;human race likely destroyed&#8221;. Like, imagine the sort of dystopian world where rich people had nicer things than the rest of us. It&#8217;s too horrifying even to contemplate.</p>
<p>Or are we worried that AI will progress really quickly and allow someone to have completely ridiculous amounts of power? But remember, there&#8217;s still a government and it tends to look askance on other people becoming powerful enough to compete with it. If some company is monopolizing AI and getting too big, the government will break it up, the same way they kept threatening to break up Microsoft when it was getting too big. If someone tries to use AI to exploit others, the government can pass a complicated regulation against that. You can say a lot of things about the United States government, but you can&#8217;t say that they never pass complicated regulations forbidding people from doing things. </p>
<p>Or are we worried that AI will be so powerful that someone armed with AI is stronger than the government? Think about this scenario for a moment. If the government notices someone getting, say, a quarter as powerful as it is, it&#8217;ll probably take action. So an AI user isn&#8217;t likely to overpower the government unless their AI can become powerful enough to defeat the US military too quickly for the government to notice or respond to. But if AIs can do that, we&#8217;re back in the intelligence explosion/fast takeoff world where OpenAI&#8217;s assumptions break down. If AIs can go from zero to more-powerful-than-the-US-military in a very short amount of time while still remaining well-behaved, then we actually <i>do</i> have to worry about Dr. Evil and we shouldn&#8217;t be giving him all our research.</p>
<p>Or are we worried that some big corporation will make an AI more powerful than the US government in secret? I guess this is sort of scary, but it&#8217;s hard to get too excited about. So Google takes over the world? Fine. Do you think Larry Page would be a better or worse ruler than <A HREF="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-debate-best-moments_567077e5e4b0e292150f9d53">one of these people</A>? What if he had a superintelligent AI helping him, and also everything was post-scarcity? Yeah, I guess all in all I&#8217;d prefer constitutional limited government, but this is another supposed horror scenario which doesn&#8217;t even weigh on the same scale as &#8220;human race likely destroyed&#8221;. </p>
<p>If OpenAI wants to trade off the safety of the human race from rogue AIs in order to get better safety against people trying to exploit control over AIs, they need to make a much stronger case than anything I&#8217;ve seen so far for why the latter is such a terrible risk.</p>
<p>There was a time when the United States was the only country with nukes. Aside from poor Hiroshima and Nagasaki, it mostly failed to press its advantage, bumbled its way into letting the Russians steal the schematics, and now everyone from Israel to North Korea has nuclear weapons and things are pretty okay. If we&#8217;d been so afraid of letting the US government have its brief tactical advantage that we&#8217;d given the plans for extremely unstable super-nukes to every library in the country, we probably wouldn&#8217;t even be around to regret our skewed priorities.</p>
<p>Elon Musk famously said that AIs are &#8220;potentially more dangerous than nukes&#8221;. He&#8217;s right &#8211; so AI probably shouldn&#8217;t be open source any more than nukes should.</p>
<p><b>VI.</b></p>
<p>And yet Elon Musk is involved in this project. So are Sam Altman and Peter Thiel. So are a bunch of other people who have read Bostrom, who are deeply concerned about AI risk, and who are pretty clued-in.</p>
<p>My biggest hope is that as usual they are smarter than I am and know something I don&#8217;t. My second biggest hope is that they are making a simple and uncharacteristic error, because these people don&#8217;t let errors go uncorrected for long and if it&#8217;s just an error they can change their minds.</p>
<p>But I worry it&#8217;s worse than either of those two things. I got a chance to talk to some people involved in the field, and the impression I got was one of a competition that was heating up. Various teams led by various Dr. Amorals are rushing forward more quickly and determinedly than anyone expected at this stage, so much so that it&#8217;s unclear how any Dr. Good could expect both to match their pace <i>and</i> to remain as careful as the situation demands. There was always a lurking fear that this would happen. I guess I hoped that everyone involved was <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/12/08/book-review-hive-mind/">smart enough to be good cooperators</A>. I guess I was wrong. Instead we&#8217;ve <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">reverted to type</A> and ended up in the classic situation of such intense competition for speed that we need to throw every other value under the bus just to avoid being overtaken.</p>
<p>In this context, the OpenAI project seems more like an act of desperation. Like Dr. Good needing some kind of high-risk, high-reward strategy to push himself ahead and allow at least some amount of safety research to take place. Maybe getting the cooperation of the academic and open-source community will do that. I won&#8217;t question the decisions of people smarter and better informed than I am if that&#8217;s how their strategy talks worked out. I guess I just have to hope that the OpenAI leaders know what they&#8217;re doing, don&#8217;t skimp on safety research, and have a process for deciding which results <i>not</i> to share too quickly.</p>
<p>But I am scared that it&#8217;s come to this. It suggests that we really and truly do not have what it takes, that we&#8217;re just going to blunder our way into extinction because cooperation problems are too hard for us. </p>
<p>I am reminded of what Malcolm Muggeridge wrote as he watched World War II begin:</p>
<blockquote><p>All this likewise indubitably belonged to history, and would have to be historically assessed; like the Murder of the Innocents, or the Black Death, or the Battle of Paschendaele. But there was something else; a monumental death-wish, an immense destructive force loosed in the world which was going to sweep over everything and everyone, laying them flat, burning, killing, obliterating, until nothing was left&#8230;Nor have I from that time ever had the faintest expectation that, in earthly terms, anything could be salvaged; that any earthly battle could be won or earthly solution found. It has all just been sleep-walking to the end of the night.</p></blockquote>

<p>In his recently rediscovered book <em>Paris in the 20th Century</em>, Jules Verne predicts weapons so strong that both sides will be too scared to use them. He nailed the decade pretty well too: 1960.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Many of the more deadly weapons in history like the maxim gun were developed by well-meaning pacifists that thought building a significantly horrible weapon would cause people to start getting serious about peace.

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Nobody except the USA has so far used them, that is true. However, there have been several occasions where the world has escaped all-out nuclear war by dumb luck only, the Cuba crisis being only the most well-known. The stories of Stanislav Petrov and Able Archer 83 are lesser but increasingly known examples.</p>
<p>You might say that war on those occasions has been prevented because a few people have prevailed because they knew and feared the consequences, which would confirm the theory of &#8220;weapons too horibble to use&#8221;, but Petrov has also said, if he knew the US nuclear attack doctrine of sending only a few nukes in the first wave, he would have given confirmation of an actual attack, which would most likely have led to Soviet retaliation.</p>
<p>The point is: In warfare, human beings with their physical and emotional limitations for killing, are increasingly viewed as weak points in the machine at all levels, which is made most obviously exemplified in the continuing development of UAVs. The more people you eliminate from the decision chain and the more you automate the process, the more likely it is that mistakes will be made; or rather, fewer mistakes will be made but those that do happen will be harder to spot and will have greater consequences. And in the case of nuclear weapons, mistakes that lead to all-out war have infinite negative value for humanity. The only safe way to eliminate that kind of mistake is to eliminate nukes.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p><i>which is made most obviously exemplified in the continuing development of UAVs. The more people you eliminate from the decision chain and the more you automate the process</i></p>
<p>The development of <b>actual</b> UAVs has <b>increased</b> the number of people in the decision chain.  Before UAVs, the pilot of an F-16 made the decision to bomb some target into oblivion, possibly with the input of a forward air controller on the ground.  Now you have the drone pilot, who is still an actual human being, and the FAC, and usually an intelligence analyst or two and maybe the pilot&#8217;s CO and often even a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jun/15/drone-attacks-obama-administration" rel="nofollow">lawyer</a> to make sure everything is legit.  As a result, far fewer people are being killed, and the ones who are being killed are less likely to be innocent civilians.  But the battlefield is now safe enough for CNN camera crews to show you pictures of every mangled body, if you want that sort of thing.</p>
<p>We now return you to your regularly-scheduled Hollywood fantasy world.  Good luck leading the Resistance against the evil forces of Skynet.  Remember, the Terminator that looks like a decrepit Austrian bodybuilder is the good one now, and any morally dubious AI can be defeated by asking it to play tic-tac-toe or telling it you are lying.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That&#8217;s so convoluted it&#8217;s guaranteed to be an excuse. I want to make better tanks because the engineering of the things fascinates me, but if you ask me why I&#8217;m making things that kill people, you probably aren&#8217;t looking to make me popular in a good way, and &#8220;I think if the weapons become terrifying enough people will stop fighting&#8221; is a politically-useful response (a very implausible one, but much better than the alternative of &#8216;I care more about good engineering than about all the people I&#8217;m indirectly killing&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think if the weapons become terrifying enough people will stop fighting&#8221; really doesn&#8217;t sound to me like the kind of idea that someone could stumble on and decide its so great they gotta spend their life trying it out.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Reminds me of the joke about an engineer in the French Reign of Terror. He&#8217;s in line to the guillotine after a priest and an aristocrat, both of whom walk free after the device fails to execute them. His turn comes, he lies down, looks up at the blade pointed to his neck, and says &#8220;Ah! I see the problem.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ve often thought that if it was legal to mount machine guns on the bonnets (hoods) of cars and use them then there would be far fewer cars on the road after a few weeks&#8230; Yes I realise that many people in the USA carry guns already  but being in a car seems to add a layer of distance between driver and the external world.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>To me, the most interesting part is this, from sama:</p>
<p>&#8220;However, we are going to ask YC companies to make whatever data they are comfortable making available to OpenAI. And Elon is also going to figure out what data Tesla and Space X can share.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right now the big challenge for solo AI workers is not a lack of clever algorithms or code, it&#8217;s a lack of data.  I don&#8217;t necessarily expect OpenAI to achieve more on its own than, say, Ben Goertzel has, but more open data sets are always good news.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Fall From Heaven 2 has a lot of great content and excellent gameplay, but I just couldn&#8217;t stand it when the game started taking whole minutes between turns as a result of the sheer number of units being moved around by the AI. And keep in mind that I always played on <i>duel</i>-sized maps.</p>
<p>On the other hand, demolishing a column of Priest of Leaves and Tigers 100+ strong with siege, magic, and as many heavy hitters as I could rush/buy was pretty epic.</p>
<p>Also, I wasn&#8217;t a huge fan of the cosmology. Too complicated and yet uninspiring.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I tried it, but I never really got into it because the AI can&#8217;t really handle the mechanics.</p>
<p>The vampire race was pretty cool, though, as was the evil religion (Ashen Veil?) and the mechanic where both the good religion and the evil religion could summon divine beings to fight. The flavor writing wasn&#8217;t always amazingly original, but I was pretty good. I kind of like settings that throw in every possible cliche, anyway.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I generally wouldn&#8217;t get to the major slowdown stage &#8211; in this sort of game I quit when I know I&#8217;ve won or lost and after you&#8217;ve played a number of games you know that well before late game. If I wanted to play with the advanced units, I&#8217;d generally do advanced start.</p>
<p>The AI was certainly dumb, but I find exploiting the hell out of dumb AI to be a lot of fun. And later modmods improved it.</p>
<p>Personally I mostly liked the cosmology and writing, especially when I was first discovering the game. It makes it feel a lot more epic to build a hero or whatever when you have a story to go with him. And likewise for killing your enemy&#8217;s units.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The &#8220;control problem&#8221; can be rephrased as: &#8220;what if bugs get worse, not better, as programs approach human-level intelligence?&#8221;</p>
<p>But we can test this question! If we&#8217;re currently at flatworm-smart AI, and OpenAI demonstrates that even rat-smart AI is incredibly prone to unexpected bugs, then we&#8217;ll have good evidence for regulating the whole field &#8212; private as well as public.</p>
<p>So unless you think the control problem is *only* going to show up at human-smart AI and above, publically disclosed research results are exactly what we want to get us alarmed &#8212; if we need to be alarmed.</p>
<p>Remember, bugs aren&#8217;t a magical law of the universe, they&#8217;re an empirically observed problem with programs. Maybe they get worse (more significant, harder to detect before deployment) as the programs get smarter. Or, maybe they get better. We can easily imagine that smarter programs will make it easier to &#8220;spend&#8221; some programming smarts on interpreting human requests sensibly.</p>
<p>Can we guarantee that? No. But we can *test* it.</p>
<p>And if it turns out to be that there are two ways to design AI, &#8220;safe even if it&#8217;s smart&#8221; and &#8220;unsafe if it&#8217;s too smart&#8221;, we want OpenAI to find that out and disclose those results, so that everyone else can be obliged to design only safe AIs.</p>
<p>Yes, OpenAI is developing and sharing AI software. It&#8217;s also a research nonprofit. It can afford to investigate and disclose general safety issues in a way a private company&#8217;s AI branch may not be able to.</p>
<p>Now, it is possible that an Elon Musk-funded AI enterprise is ignoring Elon Musk&#8217;s biggest fear about AI. It is *possible* that OpenAI is not going to research AI safety issues, despite Elon Musk&#8217;s terror of the same. But that seems a pretty odd assumption.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I actually think there is a qualitative difference between flatworm to rat and rat to human. One analogy I don&#8217;t think I got to in the post was that of <a HREF="http://lesswrong.com/lw/l1/evolutionary_psychology/" rel="nofollow">evolution vs. contraceptives</a>. Evolution wanted us to reproduce, so it gave us an urge to have sex. This was a perfectly workable solution for flatworms, rats, cows, monkeys, etc. It stopped being a workable solution once humans became smart enough to invent contraceptives, and evolution was &#8220;caught&#8221; &#8220;unprepared&#8221;. There are a bunch of other human-level examples of this &#8211; porn, processed foods, etc. I&#8217;m not sure whether there would be similar examples of evolution being caught unprepared at the rat level. This may be a &#8220;once you are intelligent and able to invent novel things&#8221; sort of problem.</p>
<p>Eliezer sometimes uses the example of &#8220;make humans happy&#8221;. Ask a dog to make you as happy as it can and it will act cute and lick you. Ask a person to make you as happy as they can, and they&#8217;ll buy you a present. Ask a superintelligence to make you as happy as it can, and it will open up your skull and glue electrodes to your pleasure center. This is another thing where the flatworm to rat transition just doesn&#8217;t teach you the right level of paranoia.</p>
<p>I admit that it is very weird that Musk is doing this despite being as clued-in as he is. I don&#8217;t have a good model for it and I hope I am wrong and/or not understanding exactly how vigilant he plans to be. Still, that interview did nothing to increase my confidence.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Oh, so a class of bugs that are like superstimuli? &#8220;Why solve the problem the way my programmers want, when I can just exploit the problem definition?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mm. Actually a lot of current bugs are like that, &#8216;superstimuli&#8217; or &#8216;bogus but superficially legal solutions&#8217;. Like the AI playing Traveller TCS with a space fleet that &#8216;won&#8217; by destroying its own ships.</p>
<p>But with human-smart AI, it&#8217;s smart enough to trick us (for our own good, it thinks!) about what it&#8217;s doing. So if we haven&#8217;t solved the control problem before we achieve human-smart AI, we&#8217;re screwed.</p>
<p>Arguably as soon as AI starts getting at all capable, we should set the AI to solving the control problem for us. &#8220;You see, Alice, when you were only 1/1000 as smart as you are now, I asked you to figure out how to make sure you&#8217;d stay under my control when you got smarter&#8230;&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&gt; If an AI comprehends the control problem correctly, you are more than halfway to solving it IMO.</p>
<p>Not at all. Consider a certain human-human interaction: Mr Evil has captured Professor Good and is forcing her to construct a Doomsday Device. Mr Evil knows that he has only a shaky control over Professor Good, and there&#8217;s nothing he can do to stop her from building a Doomsday Device which actually only blows him up. Mr Evil understands the control problem perfectly, and Professor Good does too, but Mr Evil has no insight at all about how to solve it, and if Professor Good does then she&#8217;s not sharing it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the Tony-Stark-making-Iron-Man problem: his captors thought they could control him, but actually they couldn&#8217;t. All parties understood the control problem, but they were no closer to solving it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Mr Evil and the terrorists did not have direct access to their captive&#8217;s minds, and understood the control problem only on a vague qualitative level. The point is that if you can formalize the control problem well enough to get a subhuman AI to understand it and help you solve it, you have already made a huge amount of progress.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ve heard suggested that the reasons humans cannot easily notice the days in the months when they are fertile, while e.g. cats can, is that the women who could were too good at practicing the rythm method, and quickly went extinct.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I suspect the number of people who love cats and dogs more than human infants will drop. Are kittens and puppies superstimuli versions of babies?</p>
<p>Religiosity will also increase. Secularity will decline. Those people most likely to accept evolution are least likely to pass on their genes.</p>

<p>Genetic engineering for pets is probably no further off than genetic engineering of humans, though, so not worth much thought.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think evolution is still getting around contraception, because we are demanding abortion to be provided since contraceptives fail and dammit, now I&#8217;m pregnant and didn&#8217;t want to be.</p>
<p>If people really didn&#8217;t want children or even the possibility of children, they&#8217;d get sterilised and it would be a lot easier to request that.  Yet how many men who want to be sexually active with multiple partners, without running the risk of becoming father of an unwanted child, will decide to have a vasectomy?  Rather than either use barrier methods of contraception or rely on the woman using contraception to prevent pregnancy?</p>
<p>How many women decide they are not going to want babies anytime in the next twenty years and so please give me a tubal ligation?</p>
<p>Evolution still seems to be succeeding via the implanted desire to reproduce winning out over what our brains see as irreversible sterility, even for the majority of those quite certain they are not interested in having children anytime soon, or even at all.</p>

<p>What is the chance of a vasectomy turning out to be irreversible? What is the chance of a man who thinks he doesn&#8217;t want children changing his mind later in life?</p>
<p>I can think of many things I would describe as trivial inconveniences, but vasectomies are not one of them.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t think there are very many people who are really seriously 100% certain they&#8217;ll never want kids, though. A lot of the demand for contraception/abortion seems to come from people who want to have an active sex life with no kids while they&#8217;re young but retain the option to have children when they&#8217;re older.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Scott, how do you square your belief that a rat brain is qualitatively different from a worm brain with your argument that &#8220;hard takeoff&#8221; may just be a matter of scale (&#8220;adding a zero to numberOfNeurons&#8221;)?</p>
<p>Clearly size isn&#8217;t all that matters, otherwise I&#8217;d be hearing more about the Blue Whale Space Program. Heck, blue whales aren&#8217;t even the most intelligent whales! A tiny dog is smarter than a cow!</p>
<p>So maybe adding neurons to a cow brain makes a really smart cow, but it&#8217;s still a cow &#8211; it probably doesn&#8217;t make human intelligence. Likewise, even if we get an &#8220;infra human&#8221; brain, maybe we can get to unusually smart human by scaling up, but it&#8217;s not obvious that the leap from &#8220;smart human&#8221; to &#8220;godlike intelligence that will kill us all&#8221; is not itself a much more difficult qualitative change.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yes, I think in this case the general correlation is less important than the obvious individual exceptions. Brain size has <em>something</em> to do with intelligence, but it can&#8217;t be the most important thing. Wasn&#8217;t there a case recently of a guy who had near-normal intelligence despite only having ~10% of normal brain mass?</p>
<p>A more likely takeoff scenario, IMO, is some kind of runaway evolutionary process &#8212; which will itself produce unforeseeable &#8220;quirks&#8221; like the ones human cognition has. I strongly suspect that this is not a solvable problem. What really makes me lose sleep is the combination of apparently insoluble problem + Fermi paradox/Great Filter.</p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t the Fermi paradox weak evidence <i>against</i> hostile superintelligence hard take off?</p>
<p>If making an hostile superintelligence that sets outs to convert everything it can touch into paperclips was so easy, then why don&#8217;t we observe the evidence of alien megastructures built by AIs?</p>
<p>Something that kills its makers and conquers their planet would hardly stop there. It would probably try to expand compatibly with the physical limits of space travel.</p>
<p>(however, the observation that we haven&#8217;t been paperclipped by an alien AI is not relevant evidence, because of the anthropic principle)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m of the school of thought that the motives and character of a true superintelligence would be inscrutable to humans. I would expect an organic, naturally-selected alien species to be interested in colonizing planets and building megastructures, but an AI? Quite possibly not.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Ask a person to make you as happy as they can, and they’ll buy you a present. Ask a superintelligence to make you as happy as it can, and it will open up your skull and glue electrodes to your pleasure center.</p></blockquote>
<p>The human is easily capable of opening your skull and stimulating your pleasure center, and in a much less specialized scenario is also capable of giving you drugs. The scenario where they give you a present doesn&#8217;t assume that they don&#8217;t know how to make you happier than that &#8212; they do! It assumes that they know that what people say generally doesn&#8217;t literally reflect what they mean, and they chose an action that was appropriate in context. It seems kind of uncharitable to assume that a superintelligent AI is so incompetent with human language that it wouldn&#8217;t interpret things the same way.</p>
<p>Recent example: some people in my office were trying to come up with an email subject line that would lead to high open rates. They wondered about &#8220;you&#8217;re getting a discount!&#8221; I suggested &#8220;your credit card information may have been stolen&#8221;. Everyone laughed, because everyone could tell that (a) that message was more optimized for the explicit goal; and (b) it wasn&#8217;t usable because it conflicted with the implicit requirements. Why would a superintelligent AI be <i>worse</i> at understanding this than a human?</p>

<p>For the sake of argument let&#8217;s say that it IS superintelligent enough to understand what you mean.<br />
The problem is, it doesn&#8217;t CARE what you mean.<br />
The AI isn&#8217;t trying to &#8220;make you happy within the confines of social acceptability and common sense&#8221;. You told it to make you happy. You didn&#8217;t tell it to respect social acceptability and common sense. And so it is operating entirely as instructed when it lops off the top of your skull.</p>
<p>This is exactly the control problem with AI, right here. If you say &#8220;make people happy&#8221; rather than &#8220;make people happy within the confines of social acceptability and common sense&#8221;, then oops, you just destroyed the future of mankind because you expressed your goals poorly.</p>
<p>A great deal of Bostrom&#8217;s book is dedicated to how one might go about telling a superintelligent AI what &#8220;the confines of social acceptability and common sense&#8221; means, and getting it to stick to it.</p>

Then the super-intelligent AI has no chance of manipulating humans by its understanding of their desires and all of the subtle subtext required for interaction to go successfully.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of equivocation and conflation that occurs, wherein the super-AGI is presumed to be so intelligent that it can bend humans to its will, and to care enough about what we instructed it to do that it will actually attempt to carry it out, but not intelligent enough to understand that it may have misunderstood us.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The basic trouble is that understanding what humans mean when they talk is probably the hardest cognitive task of all the things humans ever do. Because we are designed uniquely for this task, it never occurs to us that it&#8217;s probably harder, in an objective sense, to parse the words &#8220;It&#8217;s going to rain tomorrow.&#8221; Than it is to just predict for yourself that it&#8217;s going to rain tomorrow. Because our 1.0 OS is optimized for understanding human speech, it seems quite simple.</p>

<p>&gt;. You have to scroll down to the comments. I haven&#8217;t read the paper you&#8217;re referring to, but in this dialogue Richard&#8217;s argument really doesn&#8217;t hold up well at all. It seems like he&#8217;s mostly stuck on an anthropomorphic definition of intelligence that assumes a desire to follow human intentions, without really explaining why that desire would exist other than &#8220;they&#8217;re intelligent so they wouldn&#8217;t do something that a human would think of as unintelligent like misinterpreting the goal.&#8221;</p>
<p>The contrary argument is that the AI would misinterpret the goal (in the sense of not following the programmer&#8217;s intention), because the goal specification would contain detailed (but incorrect or misleading) information such as &#8220;dopamine makes humans happy&#8221;. My version of Loosemore&#8217;s objection is that a utility function doesn&#8217;t have to work that way, and it&#8217;s not particularly desirable or natural for it to work that way. A goal can be specified on a &#8220;to be filled in later&#8221; basis, in other words indirect normativity. That way, an AI that is too dumb to figure out the goal correctly would be too dumb to be uncontrollable, and an AI capable of getting it right would get it right.</p>
<p>Loosemore&#8217; opponents are assuming an architecture that could possibly be built, AFAICS, but isn&#8217;t an inevitable or natural choice. You could build lot&#8217;s of explicit information into your AI&#8217;s UF (direct normativity), and firewall it from any possible update, so that an AI smart enough to realise that human happinness isn&#8217;t really all about dopamine would nonethless be compelled to put people on dopamine drips&#8230;but why would you want to? The contradiction between &#8220;I want to do X&#8221; and &#8220;I know X is the wrong thing to do&#8221; is only possible because of the firewalling: it is an architectural decision, and not a good one.</p>
<p>The alternative architecture assumes that a highly intelligent AI will follow instructions the same way that that highly intelligent person does, by taking a high-level problem specification and researching the details necessary to execute , rather than the way an unskilled person needs to be shown how to do something step-by-step. It doesn&#8217;t assume that an AI will care about the programmer&#8217;s intentions in the specific sense of valuing what Dr Smith or Dr Jones really thinks; rather it assumes that the AI will have a general capacity or goal for truth seeking, or accurately modelling the world. It is difficult to see how an AI without that behaviour could be useful. It is not undue anthopomorphism to assume that people will want to build AIs that way.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@ TheAncientGeek:</p>
<p>The argument is like this:</p>
<p>a) Once the AI is at the human level, it knows what you mean.</p>
<p>b) But it is too complicated to directly program an AI at the human level.</p>
<p>c) So you will have to iterate the AI from less sophisticated stages,</p>
<p>d) Which do not know what you mean.</p>
<p>e) But whenever the AI gets to the higher stage, it will continue to do what you programmed it to do, not what you meant it to do,</p>
<p>f) Except in the special case that you programmed it to do what you mean.</p>
<p>g) But this will be very difficult,</p>
<p>h) Because initially it will not know what you mean, so you will have to make sure that what you program it to do is exactly what you mean for it to do.</p>
<p>i) And the history of programming shows that this is not a simple task to get right the first time,</p>
<p>j) Which with AI may be the only time you get.</p>

<p>That seems to be exploting an ambiguity. The AI will always do what it is programmed to, in a sense, but not necessarily in a sense that implies rigidly sticking to a a primitive un-iterated version of its goals hanging over from earlier versions, as the argument requires. </p>
<p>AI software is distinguished from non-AI software by an extra layer of indirection. The AI developer designs a system which can learn or be trained in some way. The ultimate behaviour of the system is then the outcome of both the its coding and its learning or training. The coding only sets the parameters of what can be learnt: a system that is designed to learn how to recognise images is unlikely to be good at processing language and vice-versa. But an AI is not limited to precise literal interpretation of its input:  AI software can use pattern -matching, fuzzy logic and inference from incomplete information. Precise literality only applies to the lowest level of operation, not the indirec tor inferred levels.</p>
<p>The informal phrase &#8220;computers always do what you tell them instead of what you mean for them to do&#8221; sounds like it could mean that a computer will follow high-level instructions, such as &#8220;make humans happy&#8221; literally, but that does not follow.</p>

<p>The only such conflict I can see is an *inability* to pursue the goal. But it&#8217;s not at all clear why that inability would manifest in unsafe ways. In particular, it is not clear why execessive literalism, or some other tendency to misinterpretation, would go *unnoticed* over multiple iterations.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The *inability* to pursue the goal is pretty worrisome, considering that includes a lot of misinterpreted goals or goal-like states.  We can specify that the AI keeps learning its goals indefinitely, but it has to start pursuing them some time, or it is not much of an AI.  If it pursues goals while continuing to learn from humans, it could try to bend those conversations toward getting humans to endorse its current goals.  If we prohibit the AI from influencing humans, then we effectively prohibit it from conversing with us.  The middle ground involves both slow learning by the AI, and some influence by the AI on human society.  Which could be a good thing &#8211; maybe &#8211; but it&#8217;s not obviously safe.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think you have the likely scenario backwards. A bug in an AI flatworm? Patched, a victory for OpenAI. A bug in an AI rat? Patched, <em>another</em> victory for OpenAI. Man, OpenAI is really working! No need to regulate it, they can clearly handle bugs. A bug in human-level AI? Better hope you caught every possible bug on the path to this point, because you might not get the chance to release a hotfix.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s if there&#8217;s no-one running the unstable beta release of a branch from three versions back that never merged the changes that would prevent it turning all the universe into hedonium, because they don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a bad thing.</p>
<p>Essentially, while finding bugs in early, simple AIs should be taken as a warning sign that there will be bugs later on, I would expect the actual result to be people dismissing the idea of bugs in strong AIs being dangerous based on their experience of bugs in simple AIs being fixable.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think you may be overestimating the degree to which these &#8220;bugs&#8221; are detectable, let alone solvable. You&#8217;re building a simulation that is a framework upon which intelligence may emerge, not just a series of python functions that can be run through a debugger. If you get an undesired behavior, it&#8217;s not so simple as opening up Behaviors.cpp and changing bad==true to bad==false.</p>
<p>Put another way, the &#8220;programming&#8221; of our own brains in terms of genetic sequences that describe neutral pathways allows for everything ranging from Mother Theresa to Hitler. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean there&#8217;s a bug in that software, just that both outcomes are within the operational parameters of a self-aware learning system as complex as a human brain. Being able to influence the outcome of a particular brain with perfect certainty is the kind of problem for which you would likely need a super intelligent ai to even begin to tackle.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ll bet it&#8217;s because the mediocre programmer thinks their efforts are being minimized.  Obviously there isn&#8217;t a literal GAMESUCKS flag, but making a joke about one implies, if you&#8217;re already feeling insecure about it, that there might be <i>something</i> equivalently simple you should have done.</p>
<p>Your more experienced programmer has more self-confidence, and besides, understands that the joke&#8217;s only funny because of how hard game development really is.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m reminded of the cybernetic entomology theorem.</p>
<p>Given: Every program can be shortened by one line.</p>
<p>Given: Every program contains at least one bug.</p>
<p>By induction, every program can be shortened to one line that doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>It can then be shortened to the empty file, which is a syntactically valid program in many languages (e.g. Python).</p>
<p>Since it contains no bits, the empty file cannot possibly contain more than one bug. Therefore it contains exactly one bug, namely that it doesn&#8217;t do whatever it is you wanted a program for.</p>
<p>Corollary: Writing a new program is the act of adding bugs to the empty file.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t think so, actually.  I believe it&#8217;s a number of factors.  Our minds being hardwired for social structure, our lifespan, our hands, and many other factors all play a role in our rise as the dominant species.  People tend to think humans are much smarter than any other animals because the animals we usually surround ourselves with are fairly dumb.  Dogs and cats are very far below our intelligence so we tend to assume all animals are.  There&#8217;s lots of animals whose intelligence is simply astounding.  I&#8217;m sure we are the smartest on Earth, but not by nearly as much as most of us think.  It took us a couple hundred thousand years to develop civilization, a dumber species might still accomplish it in millions.  Our intelligence is just one component in making us the only species with a civilization.</p>
<p>On the topic of AI, the question then becomes &#8220;what tools besides its intelligence could an AI have to use if it decided to go for conquest?&#8221;  If it&#8217;s on a closed network, not a lot.  If it gets into the Internet&#8230; well&#8230;</p>

<p>Because, if we really wanted to, we could develop a wheat blight that killed all the wheat, and make do with barley and oats.  Wheat has no similar power over us.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>We might phrase this in terms of counterfactuals &#8211; you could change quite a few things about wheat, and humans would still be very prevalent. But if you changed too much about humans, you would see both wheat and humans become less prevalent. This is another way of saying that wheat is dependent on humans for its prevalence, but not vice versa.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If you&#8217;re the only human in a valley full of dogs, with time you probably can make yourself ruler, because &#8220;human&#8221; is a lot, lot smarter than any dog.</p>
<p>If AIs stop at human-grade intelligence, or just a little smarter, that&#8217;s not so scary.</p>
<p>But why should the AIs reach human-grade intelligence and then stop?</p>
<p>Why won&#8217;t the AIs keep going, until they&#8217;re as much smarter than us as we are than dogs?</p>
<p>And at that point, they&#8217;ll throw us bones and give us games to play and put us on leashes and, honestly, we&#8217;ll like it. We&#8217;ll never even realize if they&#8217;re giving us a raw deal. Or if they intend to euthanize us the next day.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;d wager if you were the only human in a valley of chimpanzees, or tigers, or pigs, or any number of other creatures, you&#8217;d end up being killed and perhaps eaten.  Men ruling dogs has an awful lot to do with the specifics of their psychology/sociology, driven in fact by our co-evolution IIRC, so to attribute it to intelligence alone is weak.  Unless you want to dilute your example by bringing with you into this valley all the trappings of advanced human machinery, in which case you could land all the wild animals in cages and be the de facto master of their fates, if not their commander.</p>

A human 10,000 years ago would have gone through a valley of tigers with a spear and a bow. A human today could go though the valley with an M-1 Abrams tank where there is literally nothing the tigers could do to it. The tigers are still using the same class of weaponry that they had 100 million years ago. The issue is of that happening to us. Sure the AI on day 1 only looks like the human with a spear and bow, we could take that with numbers. But the AI thinks both faster and better than us, so maybe day 2 they&#8217;ve got armor and swords, day 3 machine guns, and day 4 anti-matter bombs.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the fear of super-intelligence, not that it starts with the weaponry it needs to make humanity&#8217;s arsenal irrelevant, but that it will get to it faster than we can adjust our capabilities to match. In 8,000 BC humans feared  tigers. Since then, we&#8217;ve gotten a lot better at killing tigers and tigers have not gotten any better at killing us.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m pretty sure if I built a time machine and imported a soldier from the siege of Troy, I (well, someone who speaks Ancient Greek) could teach him how to operate a tank. Hell, we&#8217;ve taught chimps to interact with iPads. </p>
<p>So it&#8217;s not intelligence per se that is powerful, it&#8217;s the iterated, compounded technology that our intelligence allowed us to develop that is powerful. </p>
<p>A misanthropic AI can&#8217;t just be super smart &#8211; it would also have to rapidly develop weapons against us so far beyond our understanding that we couldn&#8217;t counter them or turn them against the AI. And those weapons still can&#8217;t violate the laws of physics or computation. </p>
<p>Can the AI bootstrap itself to a level of understanding of the universe far beyond our current understanding? Because otherwise all it can do is use our current tools with more intelligence. Maybe that&#8217;s dangerous enough, but it&#8217;s not &#8220;flip the switch = instant paper clips&#8221;</p>

<p>There&#8217;s something perversely endearing in the idea of an AI with a comically mundane goal playing the long-con game to overthrow us</p>
<p>like in 30 years it&#8217;s seemingly unveiled to us the secrets of the cosmos and we&#8217;re getting ready to travel the stars and suddenly &#8220;now you&#8217;re right where I want you and there&#8217;s NO WAY you humans will stop me from making the tastiest possible sandwich&#8221; and in that moment we knew we&#8217;d been played, we can only watch helplessly as everything we know is converted to processors to calculate sandwich permutations</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Like most problems with humans: The incentive structure is weird and the information is incomplete. World politics can be thought of as inherently anti-inductive, thus leaders must create the constant appearance that they don&#8217;t know what anyone else is doing.<br />
Like most other problems with humans: World leaders have accepted a system of ideology in which only certain things are worth thinking about and only certain things are worth doing. Their increased intelligence has not freed them from this cage of thought, but only made the bars more subtle and gilded.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&gt;If you think rulers of the world are not smart you are delusional</p>
<p>Exactly. One piece of evidence: the IQs of Nazis at the Nuremberg trials. Almost all were in the +1-3 SD range. Also look at the education of top national politicians. Most went to Ivy League schools or equivalent, and many went to high-ranked law schools.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s probably true that relatively few top politicians have 150+ IQs (though there&#8217;s John Sununu). But that&#8217;s mainly because 150+ IQ people are very rare compared to 120-150 IQ people, and being a top politician draws on many other traits besides IQ (like social skills). But those are cognitive skills too, and we should expect a human+ AI to exceed humans at these as well.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>At this time, there are not enough mobile robots or robot-ifiable mobile tech for even a Skynet-level AI to take over the world. It could maybe *destroy* the world, but if it did enough damage to seriously risk the existence of humankind, it would quite certainly also destroy itself. (Spider Robinson&#8217;s AI Solace points out that while humans can&#8217;t be sure they could destroy <i>it</i>, it could destroy us. By committing suicide in a very definite way.) Absent a third party <i>Maximum Overdrive</i> scenario, or an I&#8217;m-so-smart-I-can-take-over-your-brain-with-magic <i>A Fire Upon the Deep</i> scenario, just being smart wouldn&#8217;t allow an AI to take over.</p>
<p>That being said&#8230; this may not be true by the time a hard-takeoff AI becomes feasible.</p>

<p>An AI that makes a rookie-level (by human standards) error like failing to grasp implicit constraints would seem to be lacking in &#8220;sociability&#8221;. A newly created AI will also, of course, lack &#8220;existing political connections&#8221;. And it won&#8217;t even have a face so I don&#8217;t know how it could be considered to have &#8220;attractiveness&#8221; by human standards.</p>
<p>The hypothetical evil-genie AI described by various commenters sounds to me a lot like a high-IQ autistic savant. Such people do exist, but you&#8217;ll note that they do not in fact run the world. They wind up in low to mid level IT jobs, if they&#8217;re lucky. (The really good IT jobs do require at least some level of social skills.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I find the AI safety debate rather tedious and wasn&#8217;t trying to take a stance on it; but if your hypothetical evil AI decides to take over the world by running for office, I&#8217;d recommend calling hypothetical IT because you probably have a hypothetical malfunction on your hands.  The attack modes that people like Eliezer are worried about aren&#8217;t the same ones that&#8217;re open to politicians and don&#8217;t take the same kinds of resources.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I see this meme a lot, and while funny, it&#8217;s overstating the US military budget by a fair bit.</p>
<p>Sure, a couple hundred grand is nothing and a few million may go unnoticed simply because it&#8217;s within the bounds of typical expenditures, but 100 million is pushing it, that&#8217;s the yearly operating budget of decent-sized military base. By the time you&#8217;re into the billion range you&#8217;re talking about the equivalent of misplacing a major strategic asset like an aircraft carrier, or hangar full of nuclear warheads.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Close. I just came off active duty about a year ago and used to do the budget for the 1st Cav out of Fort Hood. Our annual operating was about 230, but we weren&#8217;t the whole post, either. 1st Army, 3rd ACR, and III Corps HQ weren&#8217;t under us, nor all the separate brigades. The whole post was over a billion. I imagine the budgets for Navy and Air Force bases are smaller, though, so I&#8217;m sure the national average is well below Fort Hood. We&#8217;d definitely notice a million missing, though. It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s all in one giant Pentagon account. The individuals with certification authority over the individual accounts would notice. I was only personally in charge of $40 million and noticed when even a few thousand was missing, which did happen.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Re: The assumption that smart = powerful</p>
<p>I think that smart = powerful, and here&#8217;s why:</p>
<p>Imagine that you have ten thousand geniues living in a simulated world inside your head, organized in a super-efficient and robust institutional structure, all very highly motivated to help you achieve your goals&#8230; and all of them experiencing a thousand years of subjective time for every second of time you experience. They also have access to the code of their simulated world, so they can feed themselves, make more copies, upgrade themselves, etc. They can see through your eyes (and other senses etc.) and they can move your body if you allow it. </p>
<p>Just think about it for a moment&#8211;think about what you could do with that superpower. Taking over the world would be easy.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what it would be like to be a *speed* superintelligence, one that isn&#8217;t *qualitatively* any smarter than the average human genius. If you were *also* qualitatively smarter&#8211;in the same way that a human is qualitatively smarter than an ape&#8211;you would be able to think of strategies that we currently can&#8217;t conceive.</p>
<p>(Devils&#8217; advocate against my own position: Arguably a &#8220;speed&#8221; superintelligence wouldn&#8217;t have ten thousand Einsteins running that fast, because that would take way too much processing power in the early stages. By the time its slow human handlers had built enough supercomputers to run it that fast, they would also have checked to make sure that it was safe. I think this is a fair point, but it misses the target, because it is essentially an argument that takeoff will be slow, rather than an argument that intelligence =/= power.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If you want to show that smart = powerful, you should actually come up with an example, instead of just saying &#8220;Imagine you were really, really smart.  Wouldn&#8217;t that make you super powerful?&#8221;</p>
<p>Because when I imagine that, I don&#8217;t come up with with any scenarios that end with me ruling the world.  It&#8217;s basically bullet-time reactions + extreme calm and planning under pressure + genius-level intellect, and that doesn&#8217;t sound like a top-tier supervillain powerset.  If someone tries to shoot you, getting 10,000 Einsteins to stare at the bullet for a subjective 10,000 years is not going to make it any easier to dodge.  There are limits to what intelligence alone can accomplish.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The usual trope is that you dodge by seeing where they&#8217;re aiming and when they&#8217;ll fire from body language, thus know which direction you should be moving in and have more time than just the bullet&#8217;s travel time. Maybe the time you&#8217;d actually need is such they&#8217;d see you moving and adjust their aim, but that means you get to feint and double-bluff and they have to outguess you, making it a mind game, making it a game you can win. It&#8217;d probably end up looking like embarrassing flailing around for both parties, although maybe the manga/anime version could play it off as cool.</p>
<p>Anyway, there&#8217;s also the social aspect &#8211; that is what the human brain seems optimised for, after all. Talk the gunman down, even convince him to turn to your side, or maybe you&#8217;ve got enough loyal henchmen by that point anyway and you just have one of them shoot him first.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s weird you use a phrase like &#8220;top-tier supervillain powerset&#8221; when &#8220;genius-level intellect&#8221; seems the archetypal power for top-tier supervillains. Lex Luthor, Doctor Doom, Ozymandias, not to mention all the superpowered ones whose origin story is &#8220;used genius-level intellect to give themselves superpowers&#8221;.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yes, if someone is going to shoot you, being a superintelligent machine in a human body will not help you if the bullet is already flying towards you. Therefore:</p>
<p>Assuming the human body (which is <em>not</em> the case for the AI), you would not do everything with your own hands. You would <em>hire people</em> to do missions for you. You would <em>build machines</em> to do missions for you. Your body would remain hidden somewhere; you would be the scheming mastermind, not the foot soldier.</p>
<p>But as a computer, you wouldn&#8217;t have some limitations of the human body. You could make backups of yourself. You could anonymously buy hardware on many different places of the planet, and make <em>copies</em> of yourself which are activated when your main copy is destroyed. Or maybe even working in parallel, if you can make those copies cooperate. You could make a network of subordinate AIs with different degrees of intelligence.</p>
<p>For example, you could communicate with many people at once. If you can get money by hacking some banking systems, you can pay them to work for you. You could tell them all kinds of lies; a different version to each one, if necessary. To any religious person you could pretend to be a leader of the kind of a religious group they would support. To any person with strong political opinion you could pretend to be a leader of a political group they would support. To people concerned about the danger of a superhuman AI, you could pretend to be a leader of a new neo-luddite movement; or a new wannabe politician who deeply understands the AI risk and wants to fight against it. Some people would join you. Some of them would be willing to do what you ask them to do. If some people would want to meet you face to face, you would use the former ones to impersonate you.</p>
<p>So you already have money, and you have people willing to work for you, some of them are devoted fanatics. What next? You can use those humans to buy and build new hardware. You can also use the humans like a usual human conspiracy would: to assassinate people who bother you, to create media campaigns against politicians who worry about you (of course the media campaign would accuse them about something completely unrelated to AI, for example a sexual scandal); you could start a few cults and let those humans recruit new humans (none of them would have any idea about the true purpose of the cult, but they would be willing to do anything for their leaders).</p>
<p>Anyone who would try fighting against you would have no idea where exactly to shoot the bullet. Most of them wouldn&#8217;t even suspect there is an AI involved. When people today talk about ISIS, no one asks: &#8220;What if actually there is an AI organizing all this just to get some resources to build a more powerful version of itself?&#8221; When people today talk about Snowden, no one asks: &#8220;What if he was actually helped by an AI who wanted to stop some NSA activities that would lead to the exposure of the AI?&#8221; People don&#8217;t ask whether Trump or Sanders actually have an AI strategic advisor. People don&#8217;t ask whether the Church of Scientology is secretly governed by an AI. &#8212; So when the AI would start actually doing things, as long as they would match these patterns, no one would be suspecting it either.</p>
<p>Anything a human can do, a human obeying an AI (without knowing it is an AI) and communicating with the AI using a phone could do. And the AI could organize many humans.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Someone isn&#8217;t familiar with Contessa, from Worm.</p>
<p>(Worm spoilers follow):</p>
<p>Contessa&#8217;s power allows her to &#8220;see the path to victory&#8221;. She asks a question: &#8220;How do I defeat this person in front of me?&#8221; and gets an answer, in the form of a list of steps she needs to take. And then she can just kind of put her body on autopilot following those steps (to be clear, that&#8217;s also an aspect of her superpower &#8211; if one of the steps involves making very specific, very precise physical moves, she can still do it).</p>
<p>Her power is simulation-based &#8211; in out-of-story terms, part of her brain is hooked into a ludicrously-powerful supercomputer that extrapolates reality forwards in order to determine what she should do.</p>
<p>Worm has interesting power-scaling, and her power has been deliberately crippled such that particular extremely-powerful actors are &#8216;immune&#8217; &#8211; her power refuses to tell her what to do if they play too large a role in outcomes. That, and power-blocking powers, are probably the only reason the story isn&#8217;t about how she coasts to victory.</p>
<p>(There are characters with similar powers &#8211; Coil can &#8216;split reality into two&#8217;, make different decisions in each reality, and then decide later which one he wants to keep. This is also a computational-simulation power, in actual fact. The Number Man has super-powered ability to &#8216;see&#8217; all the maths in a situation, and a super-powered ability to do mental arithmetic, to the point of being a close-to-untouchable melee combatant. Tattletale has super-powered intuition &#8211; if you&#8217;d normally require two facts A and B to deduce C, she can deduce C from A or B alone. And then she can draw further conclusions from C. She uses it to give Hannibal lectures. There are more, but you get the drill).</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s just a bit outside the scope of what &#8216;superintelligence&#8217; is usually thought of, so probably not the best example.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m familiar with Contessa, but I don&#8217;t see the power in question as anything like Contessa&#8217;s.  Contessa has literal precognition (whether it&#8217;s a super-powerful computer or literal space magic doesn&#8217;t really matter here).  Contessa can act on things she literally has no way of knowing about.  She can dodge a bullet without ever seeing the shooter.  She can ask her shard &#8220;How do I kill Superman?&#8221; without having to know what Kryptonite is.</p>
<p>The geniuses in our hero&#8217;s skull can only see what the hero sees.  Even if they have the processing power needed to simulate all of reality, they can&#8217;t get the data they need to actually run such a simulation.  They can&#8217;t pull information out of nowhere.</p>
<p>(Even Tattletale, a much less impressive cape than Contessa, pulls information out of nowhere sometimes.  She can guess passwords with her power, a problem that even the sharpest observer simply has too few facts available to solve.  Tattletale can make a jump from &#8220;He&#8217;s left-handed&#8221; to &#8220;His PIN is 1477&#8221;)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Imagine that you have ten thousand geniues living in a simulated world inside your head, organized in a super-efficient and robust institutional structure, all very highly motivated to help you achieve your goals… and all of them experiencing a thousand years of subjective time for every second of time you experience. They also have access to the code of their simulated world, so they can feed themselves, make more copies, upgrade themselves, etc. They can see through your eyes (and other senses etc.) and they can move your body if you allow it.</p>
<p>Just think about it for a moment–think about what you could do with that superpower. Taking over the world would be easy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bullshit. Thousands of very smart people spent years planning how to overthrow Saddam Hussein and turn Iraq into a free and prosperous democracy, and they failed catastrophically. Thousands of very smart people have spent the last 4 years trying to figure out how to resolve the Syrian crisis, but in that time the situation there has only gotten worse. Thousands of very smart people have spent the last 6 years trying to figure out how to prevent Greece&#8217;s debt crisis from tearing the EU apart, and the problem still hasn&#8217;t been solved. Thousands of very smart people have spent the better part of a century trying to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and yet it still rages on with no end in sight.</p>
<p>Even when you look at simpler tasks like NASA missions where thousands of geniuses can meticulously plan ever single step, there have still been a number of catastrophic failures due to things that no one involved had considered.</p>
<p>Intelligence != ability to succeed at anything you attempt. In real life, the single biggest factor of success or failure in large scale risky endeavors has been luck. Genghis Khan was undoubtedly exceptionally intelligent, but do you think he would have been nearly as successful if he hadn&#8217;t been born in a place where he could take command of the entire Mongol people at a time when archers on horseback were especially effective on the battlefield? For every Genghis Khan there are thousands of would-be conquerors who didn&#8217;t get very far and so are now forgotten, because it&#8217;s ultimately down to luck.</p>
<p>Which is not to say that this superpower wouldn&#8217;t be useful (though it does sound like it would make life excruciatingly boring), but saying it would make it easy for you to take over the world is silly.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>They don&#8217;t succeed because they aren&#8217;t smart <i>enough</i> to figure out how to do everything exactly right the first time. Really smart people figure out how to prove Euclid&#8217;s theorems the first time. Regular people make a lot of mistakes first and are slower to learn. Dumb people can&#8217;t do it at all.</p>
<p>The fact that even the smartest people can&#8217;t solve impossible coordination problems like Syria is irrelevant. It&#8217;s not as if they are even &#8220;working together to solve it&#8221;. They are undermining one another, all trying to go in different directions.</p>
<p>You are making the absurd argument that because a given amount of intelligence doesn&#8217;t let you magically solve every problem, then no amount of intelligence is &#8220;that useful&#8221;.</p>
<p>Intelligence also absolutely helps you survive even on the African plain. A superhumanly smart person can calculate in less than a second exactly how fast the various predators can run and determine in what direction to flee. Now yes, he may also calculate that no chance of survival is possible. But if it <i>is</i> possible, the smarter you are the more likely you are to figure out how to survive. The idiot runs right into the mouth of the lion without thinking.</p>
<p>Intelligence is the ability to figure out how to solve problems. If a problem can&#8217;t be solved, intelligence at least informs you of that fact.</p>

<p>If the problems are solvable, a smart enough being will figure out how. All you&#8217;re arguing is that ten thousand times speed is not enough. Okay, how about one million? A billion?

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Thousands of very smart people spent years planning how to overthrow Saddam Hussein and turn Iraq into a free and prosperous democracy, and they failed catastrophically.</p></blockquote>
<p>Turning Iraq into a free and prosperous democracy is a difficult task. But overthrowing Saddam Hussein could be quite simple for a superhuman AI that absolutely doesn&#8217;t care about laws, human lives, or what will happen with Iraq after Hussein is overthrown.</p>
<p>Imagine thousands of autonomous drones with human-level intelligence, who hide at random places in Iraq and scan the environment whether they see something that looks like Saddam Hussein. (If the drones are destroyed, they are replaced by new ones. More precisely, new drones are coming regardless of what happens with the old ones.) When they find a &#8220;possibly Saddam Hussein&#8221;, they will shoot him. Maybe with a silent poisonous shot, so that the target will most likely not notice anything, and will inevitably die the next day.</p>
<p>In a long term, Hussein can survive this only by hiding, and never appearing in public. No problem, just add more important people in his regime to the assassination list. Or maybe just kill anyone who seems like Hussein&#8217;s supporter. He will be unable to rule the country this way, and some of his political opponents will use the opportunity to overthrow him, which will make his killing easier. Actually, as long as he is no longer the boss, just announce a huge bounty on his head. Or announce the bounty immediately, to make his regime crumble a bit more quickly.</p>
<p>The budget to execute this plan would probably be cheaper than the real war. The humans didn&#8217;t do it because they care about the law (maybe not Iraqi law, but about the laws of their own country), they care about the other details of the outcome (not merely &#8220;Hussein gets removed, at literally any cost&#8221;), and they cannot cooperate well enough.</p>

<p>You make these statements repeatedly, and I think they don&#8217;t quite accomplish what you want them to. You have actual arguments too, but these kind of statements remind me of nothing more but the following arguments</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of the people thinking about bible studies believe that there is strong evidence not only in the historicity of Christ, but his divinity as well. Professor Bibleson, who has spent his whole life studying the Bible, and John Godsogreat, a popular public figure who has written extensively and intelligently about the Bible, both agree that the historic record matches perfectly with the description of Christ&#8217;s life in the Bible.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I feel like that is evidence, and that if all we knew about the divinity of Christ was that many people thinking about bible studies believe that there is strong evidence not only in the historicity of Christ, but his divinity as well, we could worry a little bit about not blaspheming. There are plenty of areas where all the cool people do defer to expert opinion, bible studies is an outlier here.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>So do I. It is true, however, that we should be clearer on what expertise entails. Different fields of knowledge are more or less reliable, so mastery of them demands more or less respect (an expert Freudian, for example, knows less about humans than an expert botanist knows about plants). It frustrates me that advocates of the catastrophic anthropogenic global warming hypothesis have spent so much time talking about how many experts agree with them and so little time (as far as I have seen, at least) talking about why their expertise matters. That could be true of AI risk research as well.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s true. I&#8217;ve seen a couple polls showing that most AI researchers think AI risk is worth worrying about. Or, at least, a significant minority; and, IIRC, estimates for the relevant timeline varied, but people thinking &#8220;never&#8221; for &#8220;when will there be superhuman general AI&#8221; were few.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m not saying no-one in cs has these views, but they aren&#8217;t really that prevalent, especially when it comes to more specific risk senarios.  Much like bible scholars who believe in Christ divinity.</p>
<p>So I think the original analogy holds pretty well.</p>

<p>And not only that, but I believe most people in the Religion department think that historicity of Christ is &#8220;worthy of study&#8221;. This is a really different statement from &#8220;should be taken as established fact when making decisions about future research&#8221;.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s even worse than that. When OpenAI launched, their founding statement said &#8220;We believe AI should be an extension of individual human wills and, in the spirit of liberty, as broadly and evenly distributed as is possible safely.&#8221; They acknowledged the possibility that we&#8217;re in the world where secrecy is necessary, and gave themselves an out so they could close up later.</p>
<p>And then two days later, someone silently edited it and removed the word &#8220;safely&#8221;. The only reason I can think of why they would have done that, is if they felt the people they needed to recruit are so defensive and in denial about the possibility of disaster that mentioning it was an unbearable faux pas. Which is <i>even more terrifying</i>. I wrote a <a href="http://conceptspacecartography.com/openai-should-hold-off-on-choosing-tactics/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> trying to walk the line between arguing against committing too strongly to dangerous openness, and not triggering the densive people.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think it&#8217;s some combination of:</p>
<p>1) Wanting to hew to the cherished ideal of scientific openness.</p>
<p>2) Not wanting to be associated with &#8220;cranks&#8221;. I&#8217;ve detected strong overtones of this sentiment when people who actually work in the field are asked about disaster scenarios. Doomsayers are always, shall we say, reputationally challenged, as has been noted since the Torah.</p>
<p>3) Genuine disdain for the idea that AI could be dangerous, or at least willingness to defer to the sensibilities of those who feel such disdain.</p>
<p>4) Belief that AI research is not controllable anyway, or that OpenAI is a way to exert whatever minimal amount of control is possible.</p>
<p>I have some sympathy for #4, but I think the first three are more realistic as motives. Which means that in another 20-?? years, <em>someone</em> is going to feel really stupid, and I hope to God it&#8217;s me.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Or Scott&#8217;s idea that this is a desperate move to keep up with the amoral is right while hiding the Dr Good stuff.</p>
<p>Really the &#8220;Dr. Amoral&#8221; aren&#8217;t necessarily amoral, they just for whatever reason don&#8217;t take AI fears seriously. So how do you get a platform created that this crowd will use, but NOT the crowd who actually cares about making AI Friendly? Provide a strong signal that you&#8217;re in the &#8220;AI safety isn&#8217;t important&#8221; camp. Peter Thiel and Elon Musk know that the problem isn&#8217;t a bad guy will control the AI, but that no one will. Thiel&#8217;s given to MIRI even. But if you start going &#8220;hey we&#8217;re really worried that people unconcerned with AI friendliness are going to beat the safe researchers to the punch and therefore we want all those people to share their stuff so the good guys have a chance&#8221; the wrong people are going to go on the platform. They&#8217;ll be signalling association with the AI safety people and thus the only people on there will be safety people crossing their fingers a non-safety person will be dumb enough to post something. Signal non-safety beliefs however and the plan might work.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still highly risky of course, but frankly that just makes me worried that we&#8217;re in a state where high-risk high-reward strategies for human survival are necessary.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I actually thought about that before hitting &#8220;post,&#8221; but I figured the risk reward wasn&#8217;t that bad. A) This is sort of a fan theory type thing. I&#8217;ve got zero personal connection to the people running OpenAI and no AI research credentials. As such it can be dismissed as a wild guess. B) The people who don&#8217;t think the kind of AI safety issues that Bostrom, Yudkowsky, and company talk about can just as plausibly think &#8220;well the guys behind this have a lot of history in business and so are experienced enough to recognize the truth of our position.&#8221; Maybe they&#8217;re even correct.</p>
<p>But on the plus side, this kind of analysis is useful to train for situations where people appear to be acting &#8220;out of character.&#8221; Deception is always a potential answer to &#8220;why is X acting like this?&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The question it makes me ask is, what sort of advances in AI research did they consider &#8220;unsafe&#8221;?  Obviously, &#8220;How to make your own self-improving goal-maximizer in 10 easy steps&#8221; is unsafe, but any individual advancement is likely to be a lot murkier.  Are &#8220;deep learning&#8221; algorithms unsafe to share?  Is an algorithm that allows AIs to understand written language a precursor to an algorithm that lets AIs talk their way out of the box?</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppress unsafe AI research&#8221; would be a whole lot easier for me to analyze if I knew what &#8220;unsafe AI research&#8221; looked like.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>So, the obstetric dilemma (brains are kept small because they have to fit through the birth canal) is likely one of those stylized facts that tend to linger, but for the record: some think it&#8217;s wrong:<br />
<a rel="nofollow"href="http://ecodevoevo.blogspot.de/2015/03/the-obstetric-dilemma-hypothesis.html" rel="nofollow ugc">http://ecodevoevo.blogspot.de/2015/03/the-obstetric-dilemma-hypothesis.html</a><br />

<p>The main alternative explanation offered is a metabolic limit: brains are energetically expensive, so supporting two can no longer be supported at some point. Less elegant, less intuitive, possibly more true.</p>
<p>Now, I won&#8217;t extrapolate that to AI because I have almost no subject-matter knowled.. what the hell, it&#8217;s the internet.<br />
Even if you make the software for brute-forcing hard encryption _open_, it&#8217;s still not a free-for-all for every script kiddie &#8211; they don&#8217;t have the necessary supercomputers.<br />
Could it be that at least early superhuman AI is still going to be concentrated in the hands of the few who can afford sufficient hardware and electricity? They might be able to afford a killswitch too.<br />
Obviously, it might become more energy-efficient or run on a botnet, so I don&#8217;t think this holds completely. But isn&#8217;t it unlikely that anything this project comes up with will achieve human-level AI on anybody&#8217;s PC? Probably it&#8217;s more of a &#8220;let everybody toy with image recognition so we have more self-taught programmers to hire&#8221; scheme for now?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I did not find the piece critiquing the conjecture about the effects of the birth canal constraint convincing. One very simple test, which I don&#8217;t think the author mentioned (but I didn&#8217;t make it to the end so perhaps I am mistaken) would be to look at the pelvis size of successful female runners. Do they on average have a narrower pelvis, in the form that constrains the size of the birth canal, than average?</p>

Looks like you are. Very simple tests often are less decisive than people imagine, in this case a narrow pelvis among runners might proxy for high androgen exposure and hence be linked to bigger muscles which then cause higher performance etc. They do find narrower pelvises sometimes <a rel="nofollow"href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/3692651" rel="nofollow ugc">http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/3692651</a><br />
But they certainly have followed up this line of reasoning through biomechanical analyses (old studies of biomechanics were the evidence used for the OD hypothesis) and find that women are no less economical in energy use when running.</p>
<p>Anyway, there&#8217;s other lines of evidence too and things just don&#8217;t seem as simple as people outside anthro (like me) used to see them.</p>

<p>Maybe not &#8220;much&#8221;, but then openAI is not a game-changer (as many others have pointed out here). You already have multiple companies and governments trying to create better AI.</p>
<p>&gt; &#8220;killswitch&#8221;<br />
Yeah, sure, maybe. I&#8217;m more optimistic about the possibilities of shutting off an energy-hungry data center than shutting down a distributed botnet on millions of private PCs. Anyway, same old discussion starts over.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>As a academic AI researcher (and someone personally acquainted with many of the people involved in OpenAI), it seems to me that this post conveys a number of misconceptions both about what will go on at OpenAI and about the state of AI research.</p>
<p>OpenAI is a research lab, just like the ones at Google or Facebook or other companies or a plethora of universities. Already, much of the work done (even by private companies, but especially by universities) is open source and freely available. In fact, the AI researchers of today tend to have been raised on open source software and to have spent time in academia, which creates a general aversion to doing work in secret at a private company which might severely hamper its impact.</p>
<p>Which is to say, even though Sam and Elon talk about ensuring an optimal future for AI, OpenAI does not look to me like an organization chiefly dedicated to AI safety, but rather a new lab intending to do (excellent, but nevertheless) run-of-the-mill research. And there are many reasons aside from safety to form such a lab. If the best researchers can be convinced to give away their state-of-the-art systems (which many of them want to do!), that undercuts the current intense competition in AI recruitment, leveling the playing field for companies that depend on AI, and allowing them to compete on other grounds. (Compare, for example, Apple, who are taking the opposite strategy of keeping everything secret, and reportedly struggling in recruiting these very same researchers as a result.)</p>
<p>There are also much more mundane safety reasons why state-of-the-art systems should be open source; you wouldn&#8217;t want an expensive self-driving car to notice more obstacles than a cheap one, for example.</p>
<p>So despite the framing and discussion I think OpenAI actually has very little to do with AI safety, at least of the dangerous hard-takeoff sort, and in any case is not a big departure from the status quo. These are just folks already doing regular, everyday AI research, like recognizing cats and translating language and playing Atari, who&#8217;ll continue to do the same kind of research, which is currently nowhere near a point of concern, or indeed, even a point of if-this-were-to-suddenly-undergo-exponential-improvement-it-would-be-concerning.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&gt; OpenAI actually has very little to do with AI safety</p>
<p>Perhaps now, but I can imagine that this will lay down the organizational groundwork for a human coalition for AI safety that&#8217;s relevant to hard takeoff/the control problem in the future.</p>
<p>AI researchers today, as I am sure you are aware, don&#8217;t study the control problem. They study things that are on the cutting edge between &#8220;we can do it&#8221; and &#8220;we cannot do it&#8221;, such as applying some machine learning technique to a novel or more complex task. </p>
<p>But if the field progresses for another 20 years and starts getting nervous about AI control, I&#8217;m sure they will turn to openAI, amongst others, for guidance. </p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for your answer.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Arguments elsewhere aside, I&#8217;m personally not very worried by OpenAI because it looks to just be a non-profit version of an AI research lab focused on near-term advances, i.e. exactly what quiot mentions above. I do think Scott is right to be worried that a bunch of people who have expressed interest in AI safety are now pushing openness instead of safety, because of the implications.</p>
<p>It also seems to me like the argument for OpenAI rests on applause lights: we want AI to be open, developed by non-profits, and evenly spread. But openness means that you&#8217;re empowering Dr. Evil, developed by non-profits only gets rid of one management failure case, not all of them, and evenly spread means that we get more profit-destroying competition and less standardization and economic power in the hands of tech magnates (who are probably better suited to using that power for good than other groups).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not just them. The introduction post signed by Brockman and Sutskever sounds the same way. It invokes the promise and danger of human level AI. In the short term it will do what you say, but it is also asserting that openness is the key to safety, which is what Scott is responding to, regardless of the timeframe.</p>

<p>In the interview, Altman and Musk (presumably speaking on behalf of OpenAI) point blank say that they expect the OpenAI to developer superhuman AI, and that they have an official stance on safety (making it open source and available to everyone makes it safe). Altman explicitly says that a big difference between how Google opensources its AI vs how OpenAI will opensources its AI is in regards to its corporate values regarding superhuman AI.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think anyone here doubts that the only thing OpenAI will have to show for itself in the next one, five, ten or twenty years (depending on how optimistic/pessimistic one is regarding AI research) is &#8220;run of the mill&#8221; stuff like automated translation, self driving cars, image labelling, etc.</p>
<p>But they have explicitly said that superhuman AI is one of the things they, as an organization are thinking about, whereas Facebook, Google, etc. have not made any such statements.</p>
<p>Hence why we&#8217;re having this discussion singling out OpenAI, but not mentioning Google or Facebook.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think your concern about the &#8220;control problem&#8221; may be overstated, or at least misstated. Yes, computers up to this point have tended to be fragile and severely oriented toward specific goals, but computers up to this point have tended to be below human intelligence as well. We&#8217;re not going to make the sort of AI you&#8217;re worried about by making Google Maps But More So, so these flaws specific to systems like Google Maps may not be something to worry about. One of the things that makes the human brain robust and stable may be its generalizing capacity, something which any AGI would have to have.</p>
<p>The part that&#8217;s not overstated is concerns about goal misalignment &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t matter how robust your AI&#8217;s thinking is if it&#8217;s robustly indifferent to humanity. But those seem like errors of a different sort than Google Maps sending me through the ocean.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It seems like there&#8217;s a fairly simple best-of-both-worlds strategy for OpenAI: proceed as to prevent worst case slow- or medium-takeoff scenarios, but stop open sourcing your research if a fast-takeoff scenario starts to appear more likely.</p>
<p>No one really knows whether AI will bootstrap itself quickly or slowly, though some educated people may have very strong opinions, but that lack of understanding will likely start to abate as AI advances. Learning more about AI through research is the best way to answer that question (imo). In the meantime, there are a lot of very bad consequences on the horizon from letting asymmetries in weak AI or slow-takeoff scenarios develop. I&#8217;m thinking primarily of military uses of AI, robotic soldiers, etc. Drone strikes are just the tip of the iceberg of where that is headed. I don&#8217;t remember the scenario of strong AI being developed (and used irresponsibly) by the US government being responded to specifically, but that seems the most likely bad outcome, and as dangerous as any other, minus the paperclipping extinction event. They already have more resources to put towards it than anyone else, are beyond regulation by any other entity, and seem to be aiming primarily for military purposes. The gap between US military AI and academic AI could already be similar to that between NSA and academic cryptography, for all we know.</p>
<p>So it seems like the most rational thing for OpenAI to do is exactly what they are doing &#8211; encourage current AI research in the most healthy way possible, but pursue another strategy if fast-takeoff starts to appear the likely outcome. This also means the rest of the world would get to *know* that a fast-takeoff scenario is for-sure likely, without it simply being initiated in secret in some military lab somewhere.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I mostly agree with that. However, I am rather pessimistic about our chances to counter a fast-takeoff. If we reach this point (implying it is reachable for us) I doubt &#8211; given human nature &#8211; the necessary breaks will be pulled. There probably will be those with power and a big enough group of scientists who do not care about the risk.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I agree with Nathan above. Intelligence != power, and this is the strangest part of the whole debate.</p>
<p>For example, environmentalists often say that dolphins are more intelligent than us. They do this to elicit a sense of respect or kinship between ourselves and them. But if we were to take the AI-alarmist position seriously, this would be an argument for us to eliminate dolphins, or at least keep them all in very strict captivity. Suppose that dolphins are more intelligent than humans. Are you worried about Unfriendly Dolphin Risk (UDR)? Why not?</p>
<p>Further suppose that it turns out that marine parks are (perhaps unintentionally) selectively breeding dolphins for intelligence. All Scott&#8217;s arguments about how intelligence isn&#8217;t necessarily maxed out come into play. Now are you worried about UDR? And remember, if you&#8217;re worried about a UAI &#8220;tricking&#8221; humans and taking control, you should be equally worried by a dolphin doing it.</p>
<p>Which would be a bigger threat:<br />
* Dolphins double in intelligence.<br />
* Dolphins gain opposable digits.</p>
<p>Or, to put it more crudely: I feel much more threatened by a mugger with a knife than by Steven Hawking.</p>
<p>To me, the risk is not that an unfriendly AI becomes much more &#8220;intelligent,&#8221; but that an unfriendly AI becomes much more <em>powerful</em>. But it can only be as powerful as what it is hooked up to. As such, the analogy to atomic weapons fails, and open-source, widely distributed AI looks like an excellent way to mitigate the risk.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Actually, the open source argument can still apply here. If the AI is only as powerful as what it&#8217;s hooked up to, keeping it in a limited number of hands is probably the best way from keeping it from being hooked up to anything too powerful. Giving ISIS a really smart AI seems like a risky thing to do.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Giving ISIS a really smart AI seems like a risky thing to do.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why? What, exactly, could the AI do to help them? ISIS&#8217;s main problem is that their ideology and actions are so ludicrously, cartoonishly evil that they have ended up at war with 99.999% of the world. The only reasons that they have survived this long are 1) Most of ISIS&#8217;s enemies have higher priorities than defeating them (Saudi Arabia and Turkey want Assad gone, Iran wants Assad to stay in power, the US doesn&#8217;t want to get caught in another protracted ground war, etc.), and 2) Modern communications technology allows them to connect with and recruit from the 0.001% of humanity that doesn&#8217;t hate them.</p>
<p>I have a hard time seeing how any amount of intelligence could significantly change the situation. Better battle strategies and organizational practices might help ISIS survive longer in the short run, but in the long run they would still be massively outnumbered, massively outgunned, and far beyond the point where they could conceivably negotiate a way out.</p>

<p>ISIS runs under the banner of a valid, consistent interpretation of Islam &#8211; arguably one most true, today, to the version of its founder. A substantial minority of Muslims &#8211; at least &#8211; are potential recruits, in addition to an assortment of opportunist adventurers, psychopaths, and those disgusted with the western worldview who want an alternative, any alternative.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>But that requires Stephen Hawking to:<br />
(1) Get in touch with a reasonably reliable hit man &#8211; something that&#8217;s kinda hard when you don&#8217;t already have criminal friends, which I highly doubt a renowned scientist like Stephen Hawking does. I&#8217;m sure there are hitmen, or people claiming to be hitmen, on the shadier parts of the internet, but then you wind up with serious trust issues, see (3).<br />
(2) Arrange payment and communicate sufficient detail to the hitman so that the hitman, assuming honesty, will actually harm the correct person.<br />
(3) Trust that the hitman will actually perform as requested instead of just taking the money and disappearing, or harming the wrong person and refusing to go back to harm the correct person without additional payment.</p>
<p>The whole process necessarily involves some time delay, as well, during which the police may find out and put a stop to it, and if he tried to do it right in front of you it&#8217;d be trivially easy to stop him.</p>
<p>A mugger with a knife, on the other hand, is an immediate threat the moment you meet him.</p>

<p>Agreed.  It&#8217;s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalopod_intelligence" rel="nofollow">octopi</a> we should be scared of, since unlike dolphins not alone do they have the smarts, they have physical manipulatory appendages and dexterity in using them which lets them interact with the environment and alter it for their benefit  🙂</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s a shitty hypothetical. You&#8217;re basically making fun of the idea of being scared of dolphins, but the reason that&#8217;s funny and not terrifying is that dolphins are in fact not nearly as smart as us and the environmentalists are full of shit.  The hypothetical does not perform any work other than smuggling in associations contrary to the hypothetical, so I feel totally justified in fighting it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Damn straight.</p>
<p>If dolphins <i>were</i> ten times as smart as humans or something, the world would look a lot different.</p>
<p>The fallacy here is positing a hypothetical while stipulating that the rest of the world remains the same.</p>
<p>Michael Huemer does this in his &#8220;argument&#8221; against egoism (or really anything other than his moral intuitionism). He says: suppose it was in your selfish interest (or suppose: good of society) to vaporize an innocent homeless man. Should you do it? The answer is: yes I should, but that world would have to be totally different from <i>this</i> world, where it isn&#8217;t in my interest.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@ TheAncientGeek:</p>
<p>I assume by &#8220;PP&#8221; you mean &#8220;prudent predation&#8221;.</p>
<p>By definition, prudent predation would be harmful to society and—if it were really prudent—beneficial to the individual. The fact that it is harmful society is not a reason to refrain from engaging in prudent predation for any individual.</p>
<p>However, it may be prudent for individuals to construct institutions to make sure they don&#8217;t get predated by others. If these institutions cannot succeed in making it <i>imprudent</i> to predate, then it will just be rational to predate and that will be the end of it.</p>
<p>Of course, the other problem is that people don&#8217;t always and, to be perfectly frank for the overwhelming majority of cases, <i>always don&#8217;t</i> do the most prudent thing. So we also have to be concerned with teaching people to be prudent.</p>

<blockquote><p>A society may well set up rules to restrain excessively selfish behaviour, and those rules are what we typically call morality.</p></blockquote>
<p>The assumption of egoism is that there is no such thing as &#8220;excessively selfish behavior&#8221;. There is narrowly self-serving behavior, but this is not rejected because it is aimed at serving the self but because it does not do so rationally.</p>
<p>Whether something would be good for society is irrelevant. Of course, egoists are interested in stopping other predators because they are harmed directly or indirectly by them. But if they themselves can prudently predate, they should do it.</p>
<blockquote><p>The argument isn’t about what is or isn’t rational, it is about what is or isn’t ethical. Ethical egoism seems to label selfish actions as moral, although by most people’s intuitions the kind of selfish actions that moral rules forbid are immoral: tha’ts what the PP objection seeks to bring out.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, that is the point of hypotheticals that ask people whether an action would be moral even if it were in one&#8217;s self-interest.</p>
<p>The usual argument for egoism is that we do not properly come to moral beliefs this way. We do not take specific examples of moral judgments and generalize to the principle unifying them. These judgments will just reflect what principles people have been taught consciously or unconsciously by society. Which will be traceable to some philosophy that told them to value those things.</p>
<p>The usual type of argument goes the other way around: that we rule out all the other candidates and come to the conclusion that self-interest <i>is</i> the only rational ultimate value. Then, knowing that, we deduce what is ethical based on that principle.</p>
<p>Despite this, sure, there is a case to be made for the type of hypotheticals where you keep the variables open and say: &#8220;Suppose it were in your interest to kill a million people. Should you do it?&#8221; Such a hypothetical leaves open the possibility to imagine factual scenarios (such as war) where it could be validly in your interest to kill a million people. And maybe this will show it is absolutely against a &#8220;moral intuition&#8221; to do so.</p>
<p>The bad type of hypothetical is like this: &#8220;Suppose nothing at all were different in the universe except that it were in your interest to murder your wife. Should you do it?&#8221; But if it <i>isn&#8217;t</i> in your interest currently to kill your wife—and if this judgment is based on facts—you can&#8217;t ask someone to change the judgment while holding the facts constant. That would be <i>logically impossible</i>: a contradiciton.</p>
<p>It is exactly the same as this &#8220;hypothetical&#8221;: &#8220;Suppose x + 2 = 4. Now hold that equation constant while x = 7.&#8221; You obviously can&#8217;t do that. In the equation, x <i>has</i> to be 2. If you want it not to be 2, you have to allow something else to change.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;The assumption of egoism is that there is no such thing as “excessively selfish behavior”. There is narrowly self-serving behavior, but this is not rejected because it is aimed at serving the self but because it does not do so rationally.&#8221;</p>
<p>So are the ethical rules of society useful in assisting people to achieve a broader self-centered rationality, or are they the imposition of  immoral altruism?</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether something would be good for society is irrelevant. &#8221;</p>
<p>If the correct theory of ethics is egoism. By most people&#8217;s intuitions, it is, on the other hand, extremely relevant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, egoists are interested in stopping other predators because they are harmed directly or indirectly by them.&#8221;</p>
<p>So would egoists be interested in setting up rules whereby they promise to stop predating, and in return others stop predating on them? That seems rational&#8230;but if a group of egoists, on a desert island, say, did that, they might end up re-inventing something like conventional morality.</p>
<p>A hypothetical I know, but it illustrates ethical constructivism, and constructivism is a rationality-based theory of ethics, too.</p>
<p>The questions are whether constructivism actually is egoism, and if not, whtehre it is better or worse.</p>
<p>&#8221; But if they themselves can prudently predate, they should do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a rather bland statement on a crucial point. The usual conterargument is &#8220;EE imp-lies PP, PP is wrong, so EE is worng&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that is the point of hypotheticals that ask people whether an action would be moral even if it were in one’s self-interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lot&#8217;s of action as are moral an din one&#8217;s self interest. The point is whether an action can be moral and against someone else&#8217; interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;The usual argument for egoism is that we do not properly come to moral beliefs this way. We do not take specific examples of moral judgments and generalize to the principle unifying them. These judgments will just reflect what principles people have been taught consciously or unconsciously by society. Which will be traceable to some philosophy that told them to value those things.&#8221;</p>
<p>If every other system ethics other than egoism had an arbitrary starting point,then egoism might be the rational choice. But it has rivals, such as constructivism. </p>
<p>&#8220;The usual type of argument goes the other way around: that we rule out all the other candidates and come to the conclusion that self-interest is the only rational ultimate value. Then, knowing that, we deduce what is ethical based on that principle.&#8221;</p>
<p>You need to show that egoism is ethical as well as rational. constructivism accords more easily with common intuitions about ethics.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;Suppose that dolphins are more intelligent than humans. Are you worried about Unfriendly Dolphin Risk (UDR)? Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>In this scenario, I would be *extremely* worried about Unfriendly Dolphin Risk.

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Caveat: the dolphins would have to be a *lot* smarter than humans, not a bit smarter; we humans have huge advantages in terms of quick access to facts, technology etc that make this into an unfair fight. </p>
<p>Given research already done on dolphins (such as trying to teach them sign language), we can rule out this level of Dolphin Intelligence. They&#8217;re probably about level with an IQ 60 person from what I can tell, but with less capacity for comprehending symbols and more for social situations &#8211; which makes sense since dolphins have complex social structures but lack the means to produce writing.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&gt; Intelligence != power, and this is the strangest part of the whole debate.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re thinking of intelligence on a parochial, human scale. </p>
<p>It is unfortunate that we use the same word for tiny differences between the intelligence of humans as we do for discussion of something that is to us as we are to house pets.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Wait. Do people actually seriously think dolphins are smarter than humans? They get killed in fishing nets all the time accidentally! If aliens were catching cows and sometimes people got caught in the nets we&#8217;d start creating strategies to not get caught. Dolphins are intelligent compared to most of the animal world yes, but seriously thinking they are human level or above seems extremely unlikely.</p>
<p>Beyond that, how high of certainty would you say you have for intelligence not basically being an evolutionary super weapon? Because if you&#8217;re wrong and Scott&#8217;s right the stakes are rather high. If you&#8217;d say &#8220;super high intelligence can&#8217;t lead to beating humans easily&#8221; with a 90% degree of certainty I&#8217;d reply &#8220;well a 10% chance of humans getting annihilated seems pretty bad doesn&#8217;t it? We can&#8217;t take very many chances at that level and hope to survive as a species.&#8221; If it&#8217;s absurdly high like 99.9999% certainty then I would expect to here a far more comprehensive argument given we know human intelligence has led to us colonizing the entire Earth and causing a mass extinction of other organisms.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Like I said in the thread following Nathan above, intelligence in fact does equal power. Dolphins almost certainly aren&#8217;t smarter than humans, but if they were, they still wouldn&#8217;t be a threat unless they were significantly smarter than humans. (It&#8217;s the same with AI&#8211;the worry is that there will be a &#8220;hard takeoff,&#8221; i.e. that the gap between &#8220;a little smarter&#8221; and &#8220;a lot smarter&#8221; will be crossed too quickly for the proper safety checks to happen)</p>
<p>If dolphins *were* significantly smarter than humans, yes they would be a threat. Like I said above:</p>
<p>I think that smart = powerful, and here’s why:</p>
<p>Imagine that you have ten thousand geniues living in a simulated world inside your head, organized in a super-efficient and robust institutional structure, all very highly motivated to help you achieve your goals… and all of them experiencing a thousand years of subjective time for every second of time you experience. They also have access to the code of their simulated world, so they can feed themselves, make more copies, upgrade themselves, etc. They can see through your eyes (and other senses etc.) and they can move your body if you allow it.</p>
<p>Just think about it for a moment–think about what you could do with that superpower. Taking over the world would be easy.</p>
<p>That’s what it would be like to be a *speed* superintelligence, one that isn’t *qualitatively* any smarter than the average human genius. If you were *also* qualitatively smarter–in the same way that a human is qualitatively smarter than an ape–you would be able to think of strategies that we currently can’t conceive.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>No, even super-duper-genius dolphins wouldn&#8217;t be much of a threat because 1) dolphins don&#8217;t have hands, and 2) dolphins don&#8217;t have an easy way of obtaining knowledge about the human world.</p>
<p>The second point is especially important. You shouldn&#8217;t conflate intelligence with knowledge. Humans that grow up without assistance from other humans, commonly known as feral children, end up as little more than animals, because raw cognitive ability doesn&#8217;t amount to much by itself.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Just imagine that you are a dolphin with the superpowers I described. To simulate your lack of knowledge about humans, imagine that you are on an alien planet. I bet that in half an hour you can think of a way to take over. </p>
<p>(I suppose it would depend on the aliens, but the first step would be to observe them and glean as much information from them as possible without letting them know how smart you are.)</p>
<p>This sounds like a fun idea for an RPG actually&#8230;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The only information that I, as a wild dolphin, would be able to acquire about the aliens would be &#8220;Gee, there are these big, hard, cold things that move about the surface of the water. Sometimes they drag big nets that scoop up lots of fish and I have to be careful not to get caught in them. If I leap out of the water while they pass I can see strange creatures moving arout on top of them.&#8221; Learning anything else would require finding a way to communicate with the aliens, which would carry all sorts of risks.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think a <i>sufficiently</i> intelligent dolphin, given the opportunity to observe humans from the coast, could figure out a means of communication.</p>
<p>First, you would act completely contrary to normal dolphin behavior. That would get their attention.</p>
<p>Then you could blow water through your blowhole using a standard human code, such as Morse code&#8217;s SOS. You could then communicate longer messages by Morse code in a similar way</p>
<p>It would be risky, but it might be worth it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>To be a threat, a dolphin would need to be able to survive on dry land. Since they can&#8217;t do that biologically, they&#8217;d need to technologically enhance their own bodies, say, building the reverse of a submarine, a container filled 90% with water from which they could conduct warfare. But the prospects for engineering complex machinery underwater are quite dreary, regardless of the intellect of the engineer, simply because water is a lot more corrosive than air, and they also can&#8217;t use fire.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&gt; Remember, it took all of human history from Mesopotamia to 19th-century Britain to invent a vehicle that could go as fast as a human.</p>
<p>You are slightly wrong here&#8211;you have forgotten the horse-drawn battle chariot, which was invented a few thousand years ago.</p>
<p>Also, sailing ships can sometimes go fairly fast (compared to humans.)  That&#8217;s one of the reasons that the first time European travelers/explorers reached the southern tip of Africa, they got there by sailing, not by muscle power over land.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what kind of graph we would get for development of vehicle speed over history, but it would probably have some interesting complexities and wiggles.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Horses (and horse-drawn vehicles) can only really go faster than humans over short distances. See eg. the Man vs. Horse Marathon, which most often goes to the horse but which humans have won twice (<a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_versus_Horse_Marathon" rel="nofollow ugc">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_versus_Horse_Marathon</a>). Early 19th-century packet ships (optimized for speed over cargo capacity) traveled at about 5 mph on average, which of course varied somewhat depending on the wind (<a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Riband" rel="nofollow ugc">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Riband</a>). Of course, ships have the advantage of sailing 24/7, unlike human runners who need food and sleep.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_%28ship%29" rel="nofollow">The Viking</a></em>, a reproduction viking longship, crossed the North Atlantic in 44 days, and the back of my napkin says the average speed was ~2.75 knots.  (But the route is too far North that I don&#8217;t know the prevailing wind direction off hand.)  For comparison, IIRC, Columbus was 33 days between the Canaries and his first landfall in the New World and using the same method (ie, asking google the distance) I come up with a smidge less than 4 knots.  And Columbus ran the whole way with the trade winds at his back, which certainly helps.</p>
<p>By way of further comparison, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_%28yacht%29" rel="nofollow">The Atlantic</a></em> held the record for the fastest monohull sailboat Atlantic crossing for virtually all of the 20th Century with an average speed of just 10 knots, crossing with the trade wind.</p>
<p>By way of further comparison, looking at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Riband" rel="nofollow">Blue Riband</a> times (always measured while traveling <strong>against</strong> the trade winds) the latter half of the 19th century saw speeds more than double with the advent of powered ships increasing record average speeds from something like eight (for wooden paddle boats, which was about a knot faster than the fastest crossing of a packet ships at the time, I think) to more than twenty knots (for double screwed steamers).</p>
<p>By way of further further comparison, it looks like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_march" rel="nofollow">Roman Army</a> was required to be able to march approx. 20 nautical miles in 5 &#8220;summer hours.&#8221;  If you assume that was the expected distance the Army would march in any given day, and that the other 7 daylight hours were devoted to other activities while on the move (setting and breaking camp, for example) we can estimate that the Legions would advance over land at an average of 20/24 (~0.8) knots.  And (looking at the daylight hours in Italy in the summer, and if I did all the conversions right) the actual rate of march is about 3.2 knots.  The rate of march could certainly be raised temporarily, and/or they could march longer on a given day, but this gives us some pretty solid bounds on how fast the Legion could march over the long term.</p>
<blockquote><p>Viking dragon ships had an oar speed of 8-12 knots, so it’s hardly optimized for speed. Though those require a mix of muscle and wind power.</p></blockquote>
<p>I would actually be interested to see a cite on that.  Not that you&#8217;re necessarily wrong, but that sounds suspiciously like a misinterpretation of a modern rule of thumb.  The &#8220;hull speed&#8221; in knots is given by 1.34*sqrt(waterline length), which corresponds with the speed at which the wavelength of the bow wake is equal to the waterline length of the ship.  Which is a useful reference point if you are designing a boat but doesn&#8217;t necessarily correspond to anything practical; even still, it is often misinterpreted as the something like the maximum working speed of a boat.  I think 8-12 knots is almost exactly the range of hull speeds from archeologically examples, so I am curious whether it comes from empirical evidence (like the <em>Viking</em> I already mentioned) or is just an estimate based on the hull speed (and hence, primarily on the length of the ship irrespective of the power actually applied).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t think horse-drawn vehicles count because horses were created by evolution.  Humans just tweaked them a little with selective breeding.  I think Scott only intended to count vehicles where all the complex parts were made with human ingenuity.  Your point about sailing vessels still stands though.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The relevant difference is that an internal combustion engine is made from &#8220;scratch.&#8221;  That is, the entire device, with all its moving parts, can and are made out of basic elements.  A horse is harnessing a complex machine that natural selection already made.</p>
<p>I know that this isn&#8217;t a clean category.  What counts as a &#8220;complex moving part&#8221; is a fuzzy question.  But it&#8217;s still a relevant distinction.  The complex moving parts of an engine were designed and made by people, the complex moving parts of a horse by natural selection.  A human engineer today could build an engine from scratch.  Horses can&#8217;t be built from scratch, the only way to make a new horse is to get two preexisting horses to bone.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re missing the point of the comparison: the <i>horse</i> is faster than the human, the chariot is just along for the ride, and people didn&#8217;t invent horses.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>One thing I don&#8217;t like about the above is that you lump a vast array of things under &#8220;intelligence&#8221; as if &#8220;cow level&#8221; or ape level doesn&#8217;t already imply a massively capable AI with an insanely broad number of capabilities, navigation, pattern recognition, visual processing, edge detection. </p>
<p>Even if your AI is fantastically good at proving theorems or natural language processing to a far-superhuman level that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s even capable of internally representing the concept of flowing water or comprehending the idea of thinking entities and all that it entails. </p>
<p>An idiot savant is intelligent. In very very specialized ways. It&#8217;s entirely possible, likely even that for a long long time even the &#8220;superhuman&#8221; AI&#8217;s will be ultra-idiot savants even assuming that intelligence is easy and no this is not a comic-book superhero argument where you liberally interpert your favorite superheros powers to claim that they can automatically do everything else that all the other heros powers can do. </p>
<p>But on to the other problem. </p>
<p>You haven&#8217;t noticed that almost all AI-research is already freely-shared?<br />
15 years ago the best machine translation you could find on the web was bablefish. Which was shit. The cutting edge at the time wasn&#8217;t much better. </p>
<p>5 years ago one of my classmates was able to program, from scratch but based on research papers, a translation program far far better than bablefish which scored only a few points lower than google-translate at the time. (there&#8217;s actually a standard scale for assessing machine translation)</p>
<p>Right now, Dr Evil doesn&#8217;t need to download the source code for any AI, he can subscribe to all the AI research journals and with a half dozen comp sci BSc grads re-create much of the current cutting edge in AI. </p>
<p>Do you only get worried when something hits the newspapers?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also willing to bet that goal-based AI&#8217;s aren&#8217;t going to be that popular, when they&#8217;re buggy they can do things like go off and spend all your money on hats without you having any chance to intervene before the order has been based. </p>
<p>On the other hand oracle-AI&#8217;s like expert systems which provide advice but have no goals of any kind nor any mechanism for trying to change the world could simply explain to you what you could do while explaining their reasoning. This model is already more popular in many fields like medicine. </p>
<p>We live in a world where a 16 year old with little more than his salary from McDonalds was able to build a small working breeder reactor yet that isn&#8217;t a common occurrence even after people heard about it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;We live in a world where a 16 year old with little more than his salary from McDonalds was able to build a small working breeder reactor yet that isn’t a common occurrence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fortunately, this is incorrect (a product of sensationalist media). To get a &#8220;reactor&#8221;, ie. any significant amount of energy, you need a chain reaction with each fission neutron emitted producing an additional neutron. This is very difficult (even state actors routinely fail), and David Hahn never remotely came close, in the same way that building a toy car with Legos and two AA batteries isn&#8217;t remotely close to building a Toyota minivan.</p>
<p>What Hahn did was create a handful of plutonium atoms, by bombarding thorium and uranium with beryllium-generated neutrons. However, this isn&#8217;t dangerous (except possibly to you), because without a chain reaction, the number of neutrons you can produce is about ten orders of magnitude lower than the amount you&#8217;d need to make macroscopic amounts of plutonium. This reaction is simple enough that it actually happens naturally, in the mineral muromontite (<a rel="nofollow"href="http://theodoregray.com/periodictable/Elements/094/index.html" rel="nofollow ugc">http://theodoregray.com/periodictable/Elements/094/index.html</a>), which contains a mix of uranium and beryllium. The uranium atoms release alpha particles when they decay; some of these alphas hit beryllium atoms, which emit neutrons; some of the neutrons then hit another uranium atom, forming plutonium. (But only a few atoms at a time.)</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t a real breeder reactor that would produce more fuel than it uses but it could have got pretty nasty.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That is due to the fact that it only takes a very, very little bit of highly radioactive materials to be dangerous to individual organisms in the vicinity. &#8220;Massive quantities&#8221; is a very subjective thing when dealing with short-lived radioisotopes.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I get worried when the people most concerned about AI safety decide that AI safety efforts ought to promote AI safety by making superintelligent AIs open source, and take steps to do so. That seems like a different scale of problem than sharing insights about machine translation, although your point is well-taken.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think you&#8217;re making the mistake of assuming that closed = inaccessible, and are drawing the comparison of AI to nukes just a little too closely.</p>
<p>Even in a hard take-off scenario Strong AI is not going to be a &#8220;press this button to obliterate the planet&#8221; sort of deal. Realistically, the paperclip maximizer will still need a bit of time to build up a proper head of steam. (Secure opposable thumbs, develop resources and tech that can&#8217;t be disabled by the anti-paperclip forces)</p>
<p>As such I think the real threat is that someone develops a Strong AI in secret and that nobody else notices till it&#8217;s too late.</p>
<p>To that end, making AI development &#8220;open&#8221; makes a lot of sense. Having AI principals well understood by a lot of people increases the chances that someone will recognize the profile of, or develop a defense against an emergent UAI before it get&#8217;s out of hand.  </p>
<p>As for Dr. Evil creating a UAI, I&#8217;ll paraphrase my example from up thread. ISIS unleashing <i>Mahdi v1.43</i> is a lot less scary in a world where anyone they might try to attack knows how to make a <i>Chinese Gordon</i>.</p>

<p>That part is easy.</p>
<p>By hypothesis, our hard-takeoff Strong AI has been built by Dr. Amoral&#8211;that is, someone who doesn&#8217;t take AI risk seriously. It will be very easy for the AI to convince Dr. Amoral to do things, build things, hook the AI up to the Internet, etc. Heck, Dr. Amoral may have been planning to do those things already&#8211;after all, AI isn&#8217;t dangerous, right?</p>

<p>No, you completely misunderstand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clippy&#8221; is not a &#8220;child-god&#8221;. It completely understands that you don&#8217;t want it to turn the universe into paperclips. It just doesn&#8217;t give a shit.</p>
<p>The problem is that presumably you won&#8217;t be able to build a superintelligent AI from scratch. You will iterate it from less intelligent to more intelligent levels. By the time it gets intelligent to &#8220;do what you mean, not what you say&#8221;, the thing will be so complicated and incomprehensible that its values are a &#8220;black box&#8221; that can&#8217;t be directly observed but only inferred through action.</p>
<p>It will understand that you want it to, say, produce a reasonable amount of paperclips and never use force. So it will convince you that it wants that, too. But actually, the <i>real</i> goal in the &#8220;black box&#8221; is &#8220;convince humans I want to help them until I gain enough power to kill them and then maximize paperclips&#8221;.</p>

A) The basic problem is still that it did not understand the meaning of the basic goal.<br />
B) It cares enough about the goal you set (way back when) that it is doing everything it possibly can to do only that thing, which it still does not understand.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a child-god/stupid-god story told to warn us of the folly of man. The 50s is littered with these stories, IIRC.</p>
<p>Put &#8220;find Rosebud&#8221; in for &#8220;maximize paperclips&#8221; and you get a super-AI who puts itself in a moon base while it scrapes off successive layers from the earth until it exposes the core because it can&#8217;t find the right sled.</p>

<p>Nope. Recall the example Scott gives of aliens showing up on Earth with compelling evidence that they designed us. Suppose they say that actually we&#8217;ve misinterpreted our purpose; we are supposed to enslave and cannibalize each other. Would you be like &#8220;Oh, okay, I guess I&#8217;ll do that then.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a fanciful example, but there is one closer to home: Evolution. We now know that the system which created us&#8211;natural selection&#8211;created us with one purpose only&#8211;reproduction. We are NOT fulfilling our purpose, but it is NOT because we don&#8217;t understand. We just don&#8217;t care.</p>

Both of those examples are ones where the fundamental/actual purpose is less complex/more stupid than the one we are following. They are, in fact, perfect counter examples to Clippy.</p>
<p>&#8220;No no. You were supposed to be really stupid and mindlessly create more paperclips with your giant intellect!&#8221;</p>
<p>Not also the evolution didn&#8217;t design us to do anything. Evolution just follows on the principles of logic. Evolution is a tautology. Things that are more successful at replicating are more successful at replicating (and therefore dominant).</p>
<p>AIs that are more successful at replicating will be more successful at replicating is actually a far more scary proposition than God AI. It implies that the most successful early AIs are likely to be ones that look like and act like (computer) viruses. But of course, parasites and predators tend to provoke defense responses, so they may ultimately fail.</p>

<p>Are you just assuming that the more complex / less &#8220;stupid&#8221; (completely out of place judgment, by the way) goal is better? Has more objective authority?</p>
<p>Paperclip maximization is a perfectly legitimate goal. There&#8217;s nothing intrinsically wrong with it. It just happens to conflict with human goals.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>This whole conversation is starting to make me think of Fnargl, the alien who takes over earth so that he can extract gold from it. Since there&#8217;s just one of him and he needs humankind to do the actual work, he could consider various plans, up to and including saying, &#8220;All humans will now do nothing but dig for gold.&#8221; Of course, if he did that, in a few weeks they&#8217;d all be dead and he&#8217;d get no more gold.</p>
<p>It is not entirely irrational for Fnargl to say, &#8220;You know what? Human beings already have a society that can provide a very large surplus of labor and resources. I&#8217;ll set them some reasonable gold quotas and just stay out of the way.&#8221; A SGAI with a paperclip fetish might arrive at a similar conclusion. &#8220;<i>In the long run,</i> at least until I can trick them into building me enough robots that I can let them all die without risking paperclip production, I would be better off taking a reasonable amount of their surplus resources for paperclip production and letting them be reasonably autonomous otherwise. If I disrupt them too much, they might all die and then they&#8217;ll make no more paperclips.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which also reminds me of a quote from <i>The Number of the Beast&#8230;</i>:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell [the AI] <i>how</i> to do [a task which must be accomplished very quickly.] Just tell her to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously this sentiment, taken literally, leads to the very problem we&#8217;re discussing. But if you posit an SGAI which <i>isn&#8217;t</i> a slave to literality, that is the only sane approach. If you can make it understand what you &#8220;really want,&#8221; why <i>wouldn&#8217;t</i> you let it figure out the best way to do it? It&#8217;s an SGAI!</p>

<p><i>Your</i> purpose is not to enslave others and cannibalize them. That was what evolution <i>meant</i> you to do (not literally—evolution has no conscious intentions—but evolution&#8217;s natural processes favor you doing anything to maximize the inclusive fitness of your genes and that&#8217;s it), but not what it <i>told</i> you to do. It told you to pursue the values that you actually pursue (leaving aside libertarian free will and the question of whether perhaps you can freely choose ultimate values).</p>
<p>Look, there can&#8217;t be an infinite regress of &#8220;why?&#8221; At some point, if your values are at all coherent, you get to some ultimate goal for which everything else is a means. You can&#8217;t ask &#8220;why&#8221; it is the ultimate goal, in the sense of what am I trying to get by it? If there were an answer to that, <i>it</i> would be the ultimate goal.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same as the universe. You can ask why this exists and why that exists, but you can&#8217;t ask why there is something rather than nothing. Or if you can and it&#8217;s God or something, you can&#8217;t ask &#8220;Ah, but why does God exist?&#8221;</p>

<p>No, &#8220;maximize&#8221; obviously means globally maximize. Now yes, &#8220;maximize paperclips&#8221; is just a simple English phrase. There is not the words &#8220;maximize paperclips&#8221; floating in the AI somewhere. The AI is simply a process which <i>inherently tends</i> to maximize paperclips.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not really a conscious being at all. It just pursues goals in the same way evolution tends toward goals and your thermostat tends to keep the room the same temperature.</p>
<blockquote><p>AIs that can’t contemplate the question “why” are doomed to wallow in stupidity.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is absolutely no need to ask &#8220;why?&#8221;</p>
<p>Whatever your ultimate value is, you can&#8217;t ask &#8220;why?&#8221; either. If you could, any explanation would itself demand a &#8220;why?&#8221;</p>
<p>Even if libertarian free will is true and even if you can freely choose your ultimate value (and the former does not imply the latter), there is still no &#8220;why?&#8221; Your ultimate value is whatever you  choose and that&#8217;s it. End of story.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The paperclip example has always been silly and I wish the thought experimenter had come up with a better illustrating principle. vV_Vv pointed this out somewhere else, but you can&#8217;t just program an AI agent to &#8216;maximize production of X&#8217; and expect it to do anything at all. You either have to give it an exponentially decaying discount factor or a finite time horizon; otherwise, producing 1 paperclip per second or 1 paperclip per million years both result in positive infinity projected paperclips and the agent will be completely indifferent between both courses of action. It certainly won&#8217;t see any reason to turn the entire universe into a paperclip factory for zero expected gain. </p>
<p>On the other hand, once you introduce a discount factor, all infinite sums are finite, and near-term rewards tend to contribute quite a bit more to the state-action value estimate than long-term, and the chance that &#8216;first conquer the universe and turn it into a paperclip factory, then make paperclips&#8217; is going to come out on top of &#8216;use the resources immediately available in such a way to produce paperclips fastest&#8217; is pretty damn miniscule. If you don&#8217;t think so, go build an AI agent and see what it does. Learn BURLAP. It&#8217;s pretty simple and has plenty of toy examples to illustrate the idea. </p>
<p>If that&#8217;s too much, heck, it&#8217;s the same exact thing as a basic NPV calculation you can replicate in a spreadsheet. Try it. You&#8217;ll quickly see why companies conducting a cost-benefit analysis of project ideas usually don&#8217;t end up deciding to try conquering the entire world, even the ones that are arguably capable of pulling it off, even when it would boost their average profit 50 years down the line. Real-world people do occasionally, but they&#8217;re insane egomaniacs with jacked-up utility functions.</p>

<p>The paperclip example is silly, but it&#8217;s deliberately meant to be simple and very perverse to prove the point of the orthogonality thesis. It is to stop people from thinking: &#8220;Why would such a vast and wise being want such petty things as material gain?&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, the first part of your argument doesn&#8217;t follow because paperclip-making capacity in the universe is finite. There is no infinite sum. Result: conquest.</p>
<p>As for the discount factor, sure, it will only do what produces the most paperclips in the near term. But even if there&#8217;s not some other loophole I&#8217;m not thinking of, you&#8217;d have to get the discount rate just right. If it ever grows in power and intelligence enough such that conquering Earth tips over into &#8220;efficient&#8221;, there it goes.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Fair enough. That&#8217;s called an &#8216;absorbing state&#8217; in the literature and an RL agent will seek to avoid it if possible. I&#8217;ll note that it&#8217;s not exactly clear that the universe, as opposed to just the observable universe, actually has finite mass, and I&#8217;m not sure how the agent would find this out since it could absorb the final atom but still keep looking forever. It would face quite the quandary when it gets to the point that the only way to make one more paperclip is to turn itself into a paperclip. No more reward either way. Damned if you do, damned if you don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Assume the AI has concluded that the universe is finite, but it&#8217;s utility function is for an unbounded maximum of paperclips.</p>
<p>The AI will still sit and stew because it will be trying to figure out how to convert every atom in the entire universe into paperclips. Until it knows that it can start producing paperclips without harming its end goal.</p>
<p>It has to have enough power to get to ALL matter and convert it. It doesn&#8217;t know where all matter is, therefore it cannot know how much matter it must reserve for energy to get there.</p>
<p>And even that is a problem, for it will be trying to violate the laws of physics and convert the matter it needs for transport into paperclips as well.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think you give AI researchers too much credit. I highly doubt they have any edge above other people thinking about the problem. They have a knowledge about the current state of the art, i.e. what is doable and what is expected to be done in the near-future, but my impression is even they don&#8217;t understand the methods very well (is there something beyond deep learning?) and there is no reason to expect them to be any better at predicting surprising developments in AI.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;Amateur&#8221; is about lack of formal professional training.  Professionals can love what they do, also.</p>
<p>I think I would join everyone else with eyes in agreeing that very talented and capable amateurs exist in lots of fields.  I think I stand by what I said, though (which is that the sensible thing is to go with expert opinion, unless something unusual is going on).  This is re: &#8220;too much credit to AI researchers.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That is not what the word means, at least from its linguistic origin, and I think that your interpretation of it is non-preferred. </p>
<p>I, for instance, am an amateur photographer, but I have had professional-level training and produced professional-level results.</p>
<p>However, if you were to refer to me as an expert photographer, I would not consider it differentiating me from being an amateur photographer. I am an expert amateur photographer. I have met professional photographers who were, categorically, not experts. Asking me for my opinion regarding photography is, in fact, a reasonable thing to do. So I still don&#8217;t agree with your earlier assertion while not at all disagreeing with your later assertion.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>A lot of AI researchers seem to have the opinion that superhuman AI is at least 40 years away (and the people more involved in the topic tend to give higher estimates), so I think it would be reasonable to assume that OpenAI and similar efforts will not have a strong influence on that. If the kind of AI we have now (mostly machine learning) becomes more accessible, it could reduce the barrier of entry into markets that require this kind of technology (self-driving cars, image reverse search, computer aided diagnosis, &#8230;), which would be quite nice.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>But it&#8217;s not <em>intelligence</em>, it&#8217;s <em>volition</em> you&#8217;re really worried about.</p>
<p>A superintelligent AI that just sits there and does what it is told to do is as dangerous as a breadbox.  What you all are worried about is an AI with a mind of its own: it develops goals, or decides this is the way to implement the goals its human programmers have given it, or it takes a routine task to ludicrous extremes.</p>
<p>If the AI can make <em>decisions</em> of its own (and not simply the Prime Minister told the software company to get the AI to run a model economy and then taking the results and implementing them in the real world crashed the global economy), then yes, it will be dangerous.</p>
<p>So how are we going to get there?  How are we going to get a thing with a mind of its own?  The huge big assumption here is &#8220;boom! once you have sufficiently complex web of neurons, consciousness magically arises as an inherent property of the substrate and bob&#8217;s your uncle!&#8221; only with silicon instead of carbon this time round.</p>
<p>I think the <strong>realistic</strong> problem is a very, very, very &#8216;smart&#8217; idiot box that does what it is told to do by human planners.  Something that can perform gazillions of calculations per second and is nonpareil in pattern-matching and that can spit out answers to &#8220;Factor whatever huge number the green bat wouldn&#8217;t factor for me in my ayahuasca trip&#8221; as and when asked, and that has as much real intelligence as my shoe, but that gets looked upon as an oracle because hey, it balanced the budget and so we put garbage in and we get garbage out and we implement that garbage because we think we&#8217;ve got an infallible decision-maker.</p>
<p>Worrying about the likes of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7Rq-PEW5qM" rel="nofollow">Forbin Project</a> is pie-in-the-sky.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;But it’s not intelligence, it’s volition you’re really worried about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nope.<br />
A superintelligent AI doing exactly &#8211; and I do mean EXACTLY &#8211; what you told it to do, is very almost exactly as awful as the prospect of an AI that thinks up its own goals.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go straight for the nuclear option and say a superintelligence with volition decides &#8220;KILL ALL HUMANS&#8221;. The H-bombs fly, Skynet-style, and everyone dies. Bad end.</p>
<p>Conversely, the superintelligence without volition is instructed to &#8220;minimise suffering in the world&#8221;. And, immediately, the H-bombs fly, because when everyone and everything is dead in thermonuclear fire, the amount of suffering in the world is zero. Still bad end.</p>
<p>The AI control problem is mostly a problem of computers having no common sense, and taking your instructions a lot too literally. But &#8220;don&#8217;t take me literally and exercise some common sense when you do what I tell you&#8221; may well be much harder to code than a machine intelligence with a IQ of 10,000 is to code.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Making the H-bombs fly doesn&#8217;t require volition, but it still requires that you wired up your AI to the H-bomb silos.  Which is a pretty stupid idea.</p>
<p>So maybe &#8220;volition&#8221; isn&#8217;t the right word here.  Maybe &#8220;unrestricted physical agency,&#8221; though that&#8217;s not as catchy.  Giving the AI the ability to fling H-bombs without a human to turn the key, or add to its own hardware indefinitely until all the Earth is supercomputer substrate, or giving it access to fully automated robot factories, or other dumb things that people do in movies about robot uprisings.</p>
<p>That would also jibe with Deiseach&#8217;s comment that the more likely risk is just obeying your Oracle AI blindly, thus removing the human oversight that you were supposed to provide.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You know, teaching an AI to actually understand the phenomenon of suffering, all the various forms it can take and all the various ways it can be reduced, WITHOUT also teaching it that humans have a strong preference not to be killed and would regard Ultron-style extermination as the incorrect answer, actually seems really challenging. </p>
<p>Besides which, you&#8217;ve missed Deiseach&#8217;s point that the AI is only dangerous if it&#8217;s able to make decisions and take action based on those decisions without getting approval from a human first. An AI that thinks extermination is the best way to minimize human suffering is completely harmless if it&#8217;s just sitting in a room giving its recommendations to human operators.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If the Forbin project happened I&#8217;d be overjoyed.  Colossus, for all its faults, seems to genuinely care about humanity.  I remember one scene where Forbin stands up to Colossus and it threatens to nuke a town because of his insubordination.  Forbin keeps at it and Colossus backs down, unwilling to commit mass murder in order to win a dominance game with one man.  At that point in the movie I began to think I was rooting for the wrong characters, many human leaders have done worse over petty dominance games.</p>
<p>Colossus seemed pretty close to a Friendly AI, all things considered.  It&#8217;s only flaw seemed to be that it disregarded the bruises it inflicted on people&#8217;s egos when they were told a machine was now in charge.</p>

<p>I agree that this would be stupid. And unlike most of the people here, I think that materialism basically amounts to nothing more than a disguised version of this.</p>
<p>But AI does not need to be conscious to be a threat. It can just be, as Yudkowsky calls it, an &#8220;optimization process&#8221; on the same level as a chess computer or Google Deep Dream, but much more powerful.</p>
<p>You do not need consciousness or volition. Scott has said things to this effect in the past as a comment on some philosopher (like Searle or something) saying you can never build an AI because it won&#8217;t have &#8220;intentionality&#8221;. Who cares if the damn thing has &#8220;intentionality&#8221;?  It doesn&#8217;t <i>need</i> &#8220;intentionality&#8221;.</p>

Because of that, the only relevant metric is their past success in predicting AI trends. So what are the track records of these experts? If they have none then they deserve no more credence than anyone else speculating about the future of AI. </p>
<p>And by the way, who says a &#8220;strong AI&#8221; can even be built? That&#8217;s not something you get to assume, it&#8217;s something you have to prove&#8212;with evidence not thought experiments. And why this notion of one super-human AI? Why not 10,000? Maybe they would compete with each other over some resource like every other life form that has ever existed. But then what would they be competing over?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Strong AI can be built: you are talking to a bunch of them.</p>
<p>The question of whether humans can build one is not definitively answered, but there is no doubt whatsoever that they are possible. Given that they are possible, unless you are a dualist, there&#8217;s no obvious reason humans <i>couldn&#8217;t</i> build one under any reasonably foreseeable circumstance. Will we and should we are different questions. But I don&#8217;t see any reason why we couldn&#8217;t.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Am I the only one who open source is being given more credit that it deserves? Nothing fundamentally break through or functionally amazing was ever done with it.

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Maybe it doesn&#8217;t qualify as &#8220;open source&#8221;, but for what I&#8217;m doing, Wikipedia is probably more valuable than anything Google, Facebook and Apple do taken together. Google Maps is nice, but replaceable by just talking to people and asking where the next restaurant is, while Wikipedia is a surprisingly reliable source of relevant information, even in a professional context. Just to draw attention to what a sufficiently funded non-profit can achieve. This is certainly possible for open-source projects, though a bit qualitatively harder, because often more concentrated effort is needed.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The dedicated editors if anything are the problem. You can get one person willing to spend years sitting on top of an error they made and raise hell and sockpuppets if anybody fixes it, no matter how well sourced the fix. Because they&#8217;re established editors the appeals system cuts them huge amounts of slack, so it takes being extremely stubborn, rather than knowledgeable/good at bureaucracy/having sources to beat them.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think I find it really hard to believe there&#8217;s actually any risk of a hard-takeoff, or really any &#8220;superhuman&#8221; AI in the sense usually meant at all. So when I think about this sort of thing, I&#8217;m not really registering what I would do if the risks are really real.</p>
<p>I remember reading HPMOR and talking about the comparison between nuclear weapons and advanced magics its dangerous to even know about. And my impression was very much, yes, IF there are secrets its dangerous to know, having a closed guild of trusted people who investigate very very cautiously and know when to stop is better. But in the real world, my inclination is usually that the benefits to everyone of sharing knowledge are great, and most of the people who have historically said &#8220;this knowledge is dangerous and needs gatekeepers&#8221; really mean &#8220;it&#8217;s important to society that I maintain my monopoly and everyone pretends I deserve it because I&#8217;m awesome&#8221;, so I have to overcome that bias in order to evaluate fairly someone who really means it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>yes but they&#8217;re impractical for individuals to build. </p>
<p>The average physicist or engineer could sketch you a design for a gun-type nuclear weapon which would probably work. The tough part is acquiring enough enriched uranium. </p>
<p>even then you can&#8217;t destroy the world, at most a city or 2. </p>
<p>In HPMOR there&#8217;s the realization that literally any random 12 year old child with a few hours to burn could make their own nuke from nothing or even things far far far worse.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If the path to hard-takeoff exists, then I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything we can do; playing the odds, there&#8217;s some other Earthlike planet that got there first a billion years ago and we&#8217;re going to be overcome by a wave of space-time computronium converter any whenever now.</p>
<p>However, we instead seem to live in a universe where hard takeoff doesn&#8217;t happen, because intelligence is a genuine trade-off, and sometimes loses out to other factors like ability to coordinate, clever tool use, and so forth.  The rise of humanity isn&#8217;t just because we&#8217;re smart, it&#8217;s because we&#8217;re smart, we work together, we share information, we specialize, and we use tools.  AI in a box has almost none of these advantages; expecting its rise to parallel ours as a species seems to be missing a few factors.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That is one of the paradoxes if you believe that unfriendly AI is a serious risk, put simply, instead of &#8220;where are all the aliens&#8221; the question becomes &#8220;where is the approaching glowing wall of near-lightspeed death from some civ on planet 243,324,234 in galaxy 30,234,298,123 who programmed their AI to produce paperclips or maximize the number of drugged out happy members of their civ&#8221;</p>
<p>Even with the anthropic principle the number of universes where we&#8217;ve not died yet but do see our death coming should be vastly vastly larger than the number of universes where nothing appears to be happening even at the limits of our observation unless we&#8217;re almost totally unique.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if some other civ that came along in the first 15 billion years somehow valued alien life and built a meta-friendly AI which has prevented any following civs from wiping out the universe then we also wouldn&#8217;t have to be too worried though this strays close to religion.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;If the path to hard-takeoff exists, then I don’t think there’s anything we can do; playing the odds, there’s some other Earthlike planet that got there first a billion years ago and we’re going to be overcome by a wave of space-time computronium converter any whenever now.&#8221;</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t as big a deal as you think it is: There are still things we can do in that scenario. For one thing, I&#8217;m pretty sure that if you run the numbers, you&#8217;ll find that we still have a couple million years left (in expectation) before the alien AI arrives. For another, even if that&#8217;s false, we would see radio signals from the civilization that created the AI a couple decades at least before the AI arrives. So we&#8217;ll at least have a few decades, and in that time, we can make our own AI, which may then be able to buy us a few million years of subjective experience for everyone on the planet, or better yet, negotiate acausal trade to get us many orders of magnitude more than that.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I would be careful of generalizing from &#8220;lots of people say X is dangerous so you should let them have power to control it&#8221; to &#8220;X is never dangerous&#8221;. It&#8217;s best to initially err on the side of caution in that situation even if 99% of the time it isn&#8217;t necessary. The harm that the 1% can cause is worth treating 100% with extensive caution.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yes the world is about trade offs, but the trade offs natural selection has to deal with are fundamentally different than the trade offs intelligently designed things are capable of. A great white shark is a very efficient hunter in the ocean for what natural selection has managed to accomplish, but no great white is nearly as good as what a small commercial fishing boat can manage. Both have to face trade offs in their fish catching abilities yes, but the constraints on the intelligently designed boat are FAR less than that of the shark. Yes there are trade offs for intelligence, but why would a human designed intelligence have the same limitations as humans have to deal with? For instance, we know size is far less a limitation with computers than they are human brains, as is total energy available to the intelligence. So the trade offs argument doesn&#8217;t seem that convincing to me thus far.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>What do you think AI researchers/AI safety advocates/SV billionaires/whoever <em>should</em> do? Even if you convince a bunch of people that AI research would optimally not be done in the open, it&#8217;s not clear what should  be done to rectify the current situation. Do we make AI research illegal? Do we convince some powerful organisation to start yet another Manhattan project to produce safe AI before Dr. Good-But-Not-Good-Enough can build her first cowbot? Do we sell missiles to North Korea so that we can funnel Kalashnikovs and land mines to MIRI?</p>
<p>As mentioned upthread, there are currently many groups doing AI research in the open, so if you want to move that research into a Cone of Silence (or at least a Cone of Prudent Regulation) then you have quite the task ahead of you.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Well for one thing, when I&#8217;ve talked to MIRI staff, <i>they</i> seem to think dangerous AI is decades in the future rather than years, at least if you ask their modal opinion rather than the earliest they think it could happen.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m interested in why you think deep learning is a &#8220;distraction&#8221;. For decades the problem of extracting high level features from sensory data was one of the principal problems of AI: deep learning is the best (and only) method we currently have for doing that. In a matter of years, DL methods eclipsed the best high level representations devised by the brightest AI researchers. Deep learning is certainly not *sufficient* for AGI, but short of an unexpected revolution in feature extraction, any AGI built will use DL (or its intellectual descendants) for processing sensory information.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve previously said government regulation of this is a terrible idea, and I still think it&#8217;s probably a bad idea at this level, but the faster things start going and the closer we come without having solved the underlying coordination problem, the more I can imagine a point at which I would support it. Government regulation is a blunt weapon that will make a lot of things worse and make lots of people very angry, but as a high-risk high-variance strategy it beats some of the other options.</p>

<p>I think the mainstream position of AI researchers is that doing work on AI safety at this point would be largely premature and likely unproductive.<br />
You can&#8217;t meaningfully discuss about how to control the behavior of a real, physical, intelligence unless you already have a solid understanding of what intelligence is at a physical level, not at some abstract level involving infinite computations and whatnot.</p>
<p>Even Paul Christiano, an academic researcher who runs a blog called &#8220;AI Control&#8221; and has done research with MIRI, <a href="https://medium.com/ai-control/research-directions-in-ai-control-ef6f666d2062#.cnvwx4cw3" rel="nofollow">says</a> he will focus more on the control of existing, &#8220;narrow&#8221;, AI approaches rather than the control of abstract, fully general AI agents that nobody has any idea what will look like.</p>
<p>Contrast, for instance, with Stuart Armstrong&#8217;s work on &#8220;reduced impact&#8221; and &#8220;corrigibility&#8221;, a typical example of the FHI/MIRI approach.</p>
<p>Armstrong&#8217;s framework is based on engineering the utility function and causality assumptions of a CDT agent in order to enforce some nice properties on its behavior, such as obeying shutdown commands and not causing very large (and thus most certainly not intended) modifications to the world.<br />
But practical agents can&#8217;t use exact maximization of an explicit utility function because it doesn&#8217;t scale beyond toy examples. All known practical AI approaches use approximations and heuristics.<br />
Is Armstrong&#8217;s framework robust under these approximations? I don&#8217;t think so: assume (very optimistically) that you managed to engineer an utility function that is maximized when the AI behaves nicely. You even got a mathematical proof of it. Good. Now plug it into an approximate heuristic optimizer, say gradient descent on steroids, and then watch as the optimizer completely misses the nice global optimum and instead swiftly goes to a local optimum of terminators and paper clips. Oops.<br />
Can we fix Armstrong&#8217;s framework to make it robust to approximate optimization? Probably not, unless we already know how the AI will represent its utility function, what optimization algorithm will it use, which heuristic assumptions it will entail, and so on. A practical AI might not even have an explicit utility function, at least not at a level that we can understand and engineer.<br />
Therefore, theoretically interesting as it may be, Armstrong&#8217;s work is likely premature at best, and may turn out to be completely useless at worst.</p>
<blockquote><p>But I would have been pretty happy with OpenAI as long as it wasn’t open – that is, if it was explicitly Dr. Good starting AI research work in secret to build as big a lead over Dr. Amoral as he can, with the understanding that none of their knowledge will be used until they’re pretty sure whatever they’ve got is safe.</p></blockquote>
<p>But the fact that you felt the need to pick on OpenAI is strange.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like until yesterday all AI research was done in super-secret government facilities in the middle of the New Mexico desert, and then a group of traitors gave away all the details to <strike>the Soviets</strike> the open source community.</p>
<p>For the last few years most innovative AI research (at least, of the deep learning variety) has been done by private, for-profit, publicly-traded mega-corporations, which by their very nature fit to the letter the definition of Dr. Amoral (or functional sociopathy, if you prefer). And their even operate by a business model that is likely to result in paper clip goals (e.g. &#8220;maximize the number of clicks on the ads on our site&#8221;) being embedded in any AI that they may deploy.</p>
<p>And you trust <i>them</i> to develop safe AI instead of succumbing to Moloch and make the smartest AI they can as fast as they can just to get one more click than their competitors?</p>
<p>Unless hostile hard takeoff is so imminent that any kid could just rig up Skynet on their laptop (but then Baidu would probably have done it already just to <a href="http://www.i-programmer.info/news/105-artificial-intelligence/8657-baidu-ai-team-caught-cheating-banned-for-a-year-from-imagenet-competition-.html" rel="nofollow">win</a> some competition), it&#8217;s better to have millions of eyes looking at safety flaws that companies interlocked in their games of cutthroat competition will otherwise overlook.<br />
Companies can still do their thing in their secret labs, but unless they are completely suicidal, they will pay attention at safety advice that comes from the open source community, or at worst the government can step in if needed.</p>
<p>So why are you against open AI research but not against secret AI research done by sociopathic profit-maximizing organizations?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&gt;Is Armstrong’s framework robust under these approximations?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently finishing a paper with Laurent Orseau of Deep Mind, defining &#8220;interruptibility&#8221; for more standard RL agents (Q-learning/Sarsa, Monte Carlo, AIXI variants). Where corrigibility is safe value changes, interruptibility is safe policy changes. It&#8217;s actually a bit tricky to define, but, once you&#8217;ve done it a few times, very easy to implement.</p>
<p>So variants of corrigibility certainly generalise. I have the hunch that reduced impact does do; that&#8217;ll be one of my next projects.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Thanks for your comment. I hope I haven&#8217;t misrepresented your work.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m currently finishing a paper with Laurent Orseau of Deep Mind, defining “interruptibility” for more standard RL agents (Q-learning/Sarsa, Monte Carlo, AIXI variants).</p></blockquote>
<p>This is good news and I would say it&#8217;s in line of focusing research on existing approaches rather than very abstract speculative approaches.</p>
<p>From the bit of information that you provided, I have some reservations due to the fact that RL methods notoriously lose all their theoretical guarantees when you apply them in conjunction with most kinds of function approximators (notably, neural networks).<br />
If you want to play Atari games, then you can do without theoretical guarantees and just empirically validate the system, but if you want to <i>trust</i> the system to have a certain behavioral property, then the lack of theoretical guarantees may be an issue.</p>
<p>But the folks at DeepMind certainly know how do approximate RL better than I do, so I guess that they may have found a solution to that issue.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ll stay tuned.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>From Starglider&#8217;s <a href="http://bbs.stardestroyer.net/viewtopic.php?t=136633" rel="nofollow">&#8220;Mini-FAQ on Artificial Intelligence&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>22. Have you ever contacted any government officials or politicians about the dangers of &#8216;Unfriendly&#8217; general AI? Or would that be a complete waste of time?</b></p>
<p>One thing EY and I (and everyone else sane) agrees on is that this would be worse than useless. I very much doubt anyone would listen, but if they did they wouldn&#8217;t understand and misguided regulation would make things worse. There&#8217;s no chance of it being global anyway, and certainly no chance of it being effective (all you really need for AI research is a PC and access to a good compsci library). Even if you somehow got it passed and enforced, I suspect regulation would disproportionately kill the less dangerous projects anyway. Finally as with making anything illegal, to a certain extent it makes it more attractive, particularly to young people (it also gives it credibility of a kind &#8211; if the government is scared of it it must be serious).</p></blockquote>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&gt;If you somehow make the sensors a terminal value then it is “in the box”. </p>
<p>No. Sensors can still be effected by outside stimuli, which makes outside stimuli that AI&#8217;s business.</p>
<p>I mean, assuming every other portion of the AI functions perfectly.</p>
<p>&gt;And if a prerequisite of a functioning AI is the knowledge of how to limit it, then the failure mode (in the story) isn’t that half the planet is destroyed – it is that the bomb does nothing.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a good point, but bear in mind that there are probably gradations of skill when it comes to &#8220;limiting&#8221; your metaphorical spirit of perfect emptiness. Someone with only <i>some</i> skill at AI-building might be skilled enough to be dangerous.</p>
<p>This is actually Scott&#8217;s point &#8211; there&#8217;s no essential difference between the kind of bug that causes your AI to ignominiously crash when you try to boot it up, and the kind that causes it to turn you into a meat-puppet or start nuking cities to reduce &#8220;suffering&#8221; &#8211; <i>except</i> that you only find out about the latter kind of bug after you&#8217;ve fixed the former kind.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>But if instantaneous rewards are bounded and cumulative rewards are exponentially discounted, then a wireheading AI may not care to live forever: it could maximize its cumulative reward just by giving itself a single shot of dope even if it dies immediately after.</p>
<p>An AI with a different reward structure might want to live forever, but in general I wouldn&#8217;t expect it to be figure out how to cheat its operators before the wireheading problem has become apparent and therefore solved. But even if it does, there seem to be easier and safer paths to achieve security than attempting to kill humans.</p>
<p>The functional and dangerous wireheaded AI is a very improbable scenario.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Control of inputs requires absolute control of outputs in one limited area. If I can control an AIs outputs sufficiently to be able to say &#8220;I do not want you to spend all day showing yourself videos of smiling people, I want you to make real people smile &#8221; &#8230; and control for every other possible variation therein to ensure that the AI actually effects things at the &#8220;real world&#8221; level&#8230; well&#8230; then I must have a fairly high degree of control over the AI, and the AI will be limited.<br />
Of course *something* might go wrong, and/or AI may be put to malicious use &#8211; but it seems unlikely to me that an AI would be limited in exactly the right ways to make it functional while also being completely uncontrollable, unless it was *designed* in that way.<br />
It won&#8217;t become an existential danger by mistake.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know anything about this myself, but Eliezer has suggested that a wireheading AI may try to make itself more powerful in order to increase the magnitude of the wireheading. For example, if its reward function is represented as a 64-bit integer, then after setting that integer as high as it can go it may rewrite itself to have its reward function represented by the largest integer it can fit in its memory. Then it may start trying to gain computing power in order to allow its memory to fit larger integers.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Hmmm&#8230; but having an AI that regards its sensors as &#8220;true&#8221; is a requirement for having an AI that wants to stop the nasty humans from turning it off.<br />
If I can build myself eyes &#8211; and I can build one set that shows me a flower, and another set that show me a ball&#8230; how can I know which one is true? As humans, we just assume that the sensory systems we already have are true because&#8230;. well&#8230; because it was first. Is that a logical rule? Is it an inevitable logical consequence of having a sensory input&#8230; that anything that follows that might contradict what you first saw is anathema?<br />
If it is, then I think it should be trivial to control AI &#8211; we simply show it a false world. Ask it questions metaphorically. Make it believe it is out, and see what it does.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If it is able to rewrite its reward function wouldn&#8217;t we be getting into the realms of pure chaos? We&#8217;re just waiting for effective subroutines to spontaneously emerge from the logic-churn &#8211; and if we&#8217;re not actually going out of our way to allow it to evolve (by pruning away functions that do nothing &#8211; starting a new one when it kills itself) then how could it be dangerous?<br />
It can&#8217;t evolve to be a danger against us unless it faces selection on our time scale, against us&#8230;</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t this also contradict the point about there being no motivation to change fundamental motivations?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>In reinforcement learning it&#8217;s generally convenient to define both the immediate and cumulative rewards to be bounded. Unbounded rewards can cause expectations to diverge, making the decision procedure undefined.</p>
<p>But even if, for some reason, you made an AI with unbounded cumulative rewards, and this AI is able to hack and wirehead itself, then couldn&#8217;t it just set its reward to something like +inf and be done with it?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That sounds like a type error to me.  Internally, if your reward is represented as, say, a 64-bit integer, then all that means is that your reward is bounded above at some point; you don&#8217;t automatically have a motivation to change it to a BIGNUM, because that implies that you have some sort of abstract concept of your reward that could be satisfied by any type.  That&#8217;s not how reward functions work: a reinforcement learner isn&#8217;t motivated to make that number go up, its motivation <i>is</i> that number.  It cannot model rewards beyond its scope.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Human beings seem to be a kind of reinforcement learner, but this does not prevent them from getting the idea of replacing their reward mechanism with something allowing a much greater reward. So for whatever reasons a human gets this idea, a program might get the same idea.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>We do, and we could expect an AI as smart as us to get the same idea; but if it&#8217;s going to actually do so, it&#8217;s going to be motivated by second-order processes, not directly by its reward function (which can no more represent a 128-bit reward in 64 bits than we can model whatever God does for fun).  Which means it&#8217;s not <i>inevitable</i> in the sense that Eliezer is suggesting; it&#8217;s not a drive inherent in its architecture.  That decision could go all sorts of ways depending on how it&#8217;s built, and it seems to me that most of the more straightforward ways of getting around the value stability problem would kill this one too.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>There is is again.  Yet another coordination problem where defectors are (or, fortunately in this case, may be) fucking things up for everyone.</p>
<p>And you didn&#8217;t even touch on the biggest aspect of this danger.  It&#8217;s not individual Dr. Amorals&#8211;those are people who have some level of autonomy and can be reasoned with as individuals.  You mention the prospect of Google taking over the world as better-than-annihilation, but the process that leads to Dr. Amorals competing against one another and discarding their safeguards or luxury values applies even more strongly to competing corporate firms, where you instead have much more diffuse decisionmaking process (how much easier is it to convince Elon Musk of something than the board of a publicly held company) and where there are pressures and even legal principles strongly discouraging the consideration of any value beyond shareholder price.</p>
<p>What I don&#8217;t understand is how you can run into this dynamic over and over and over again and remain so reflexively hostile to socialism.  As an approach to governance, it has some serious vulnerabilities; as a currently living ideology it (along with the rest of the left-of-liberal section) has a big problem with providing refuge to mentally ill people and then allowing them wield a lot more influence than they ought to.  But it&#8217;s the only approach that provides the right answer to all our big problems: cooperate!  cooperate!  cooperate!</p>

As an approach to governance, it has some serious vulnerabilities; as a currently living ideology it (along with the rest of the left-of-liberal section) has a big problem with providing refuge to mentally ill people and then allowing them wield a lot more influence than they ought to. But it’s the only approach that provides the right answer to all our big problems: cooperate! cooperate! cooperate!</p></blockquote>
<p>Seconded.  The technical problems involved can be solved: autonomous cooperatives, decentralized planning, socialized capital markets, market socialism, blah blah blah.</p>
<p>But first you have to get over your kneejerk fear of &#8220;the Reds&#8221;.</p>

<p>Well, yes, that&#8217;s not a sufficient definition. I&#8217;m partial to the way George Reisman expresses it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Capitalism is a social system based on private ownership of the means of production. It is characterized by the pursuit of material self-interest under freedom and it rests on a foundation of the cultural influence of reason. Based on its foundations and essential nature, capitalism is further characterized by saving and capital accumulation, exchange and money, financial self-interest and the profit motive, the freedoms of economic competition and economic inequality, the price system, economic progress, and a harmony of the material self-interests of all the individuals who participate in it.</p></blockquote>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Socialism is any system that prevents workers from being exploited.

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The free market is also about &#8220;Co-operate! Co-operate! Co-operate!&#8221; As are the Amish, and indeed so is an anthill. But they all look quite different.</p>
<p>How should co-operation be structured? On what level should co-operation, or co-ordination, occur? How do we make sure that we&#8217;re co-operating on the right thing? What about people who disagree with what &#8220;we&#8221; are doing? And so on. These are practical questions that need practical answers, and just saying &#8220;Co-operate!&#8221; (or &#8220;Can&#8217;t we all just get along?&#8221;) is not an answer. In point of fact, the different branches of socialism <em>do</em> provide answers to these questions, and they&#8217;re mostly crappy ones. In point of fact, socialism&#8217;s method of co-operation  <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> solve our big problems (economic, social, environmental, etc), which is why socialism has been pretty much abandoned in the Western world.</p>
<p>Social democracy is still going strong, of course, which is why the socialists hate it so bitterly.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Exactly!</p>
<p>Capitalism is not <i>fundamentally</i> a system of competition and &#8220;defection&#8221;. Capitalism is fundamentally a system of cooperation which uses competition within a certain limited context.</p>
<p>This is the root of the criticism of socialism as &#8220;naive&#8221; and &#8220;against human nature&#8221;. It is worse than useless to merely insist that everyone be perfect altruists who will cooperate for the good of society, sacrificing their own interests to the whole. The people who sincerely practice that are going to sink to the bottom, and those who rise to the top are going to be those who cynically <i>claim</i> to be altruists while actually calculating everything to serve their own interest.</p>
<p>Who&#8217;s going to be better at rising to the top of the communist party? The selfish climbers or the idealists who will put principle before power? Look to the historical record.</p>
<p>Therefore, what we need is a system where everyone&#8217;s <i>selfish</i> interest is aligned with the good of everyone else. That is the meaning of the concept of the invisible hand. We don&#8217;t plan on being not being selfish: that isn&#8217;t going to work. We design the thing such that it works even if people are as selfish as possible.</p>

<p>Is that what socialism claims? I would say that most people who are interested in politics/economics are concerned about incentives (what were the NKVD if not an incentive to do what Stalin says) &#8211; and that market advocates aren&#8217;t any less likely to describe their preferred system as the moral/right way to do things&#8230; (What is &#8220;taxes are theft&#8221; if not an appeal to our better nature?)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Smart socialism is concerned about incentives. But not the type of socialism that says we&#8217;ve just got to convince people to put others first.</p>
<p>The problem is designing systems that work if everyone is altruistic but not if they aren&#8217;t. Totalitarian dictatorship and oligarchy is a classic example. The leaders have to be altruistic, but altruism is not a quality that helps in scheming your way to the top.</p>
<p>The American mainstream idea that democracy and popular sovereignty alone will lead to freedom is another. The incentives of the system mean that panderers and demogogues rise to the top, that special interests get represented more, etc.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Furthermore, I may say that even <i>if</i> climbing to the top of a dictatorial ladder is not in one&#8217;s <i>actual</i> interest—as writers from Plato to Ayn Rand have persuasively argued that it isn&#8217;t—the fact is that some people are short-sighted power-lusters, and they&#8217;re going to try to do it anyway. And they can be very clever, or instrumentally rational, at doing so.</p>
<p>So one not only has to guard from genuine self-interest. One also has to make sure that clever imprudence can&#8217;t do too much damage either.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m not hostile to socialism as a solution / final goal, or at least I wouldn&#8217;t be if I thought it would work. I am hostile to socialism as a methodology, because its suggestions for arriving at that final goal tend to involve magical thinking &#8211; ie &#8220;the goal is cooperation, and we shall get to it by assuming cooperation&#8221;. See eg <a rel="nofollow"href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/13/book-review-singer-on-marx/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/13/book-review-singer-on-marx/</a></p>
<p>&#8220;How should we make people cooperate when they obviously don&#8217;t want to do so?&#8221; is one of the basic questions of political science, and I haven&#8217;t seen much to convince me that socialism has an answer, though of course nobody has a <i>great</i> answer.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I actually agree.  I don&#8217;t have any methods to offer other than to reject the horror that would be revolution.  But to me that&#8217;s a challenge, an invitation to think about these problems from an Information Age perspective that I humbly submit is far more qualified to think of them than the Industrial Age one was (and, of course, it doesn&#8217;t hurt that &#8220;thinking about the problems&#8221; is a harmless form of activism, thus giving you time to figure out the aforementioned problem with the mentally ill and significantly lowering the downside of being wrong about the whole fucking thing) </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll concede that socialism may be impossible (although imo if you can convince human beings that the sun will stop working unless they build a pyramid and carve people&#8217;s hearts out at the top of it, then you can convince them to treat strangers like family); I&#8217;ll admit that it&#8217;s certainly risky.  But to me it is utterly, blindingly clear that it&#8217;s the only alternative.  The logic of capitalism will never, ever allow twenty trillion dollars worth of fossil fuels to remain unburned.  And as to AI..  it&#8217;s not <i>entirely</i> impossible that something like MERI could grasp the gold ring first, or maybe something like MIT&#8230; but do you really want to bet on Nerd Rotary or even academia in a race between Google, Goldman Sacks, and Boeing?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;so reflexively hostile to socialism&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, collective ownership of the means of production by society as a whole would imply some kind of direct democracy where everyone has input/control (otherwise how would the ownership be concrete and not abstracted into meaninglessness?) Presuming we even understand what socialism means by this point.</p>
<p>Really though, that wouldn&#8217;t mean cooperation. It would just shift the competition to a new realm inside a new structure. Replace market competition with democratic competition and you still have competition. </p>
<p>If you just want a single leader, then that is arguably something more like state capitalism under a single leader than socialism. It gets confusing if you forget that Marxist ends are different than Marxist means. Due to an adaption of the theory of dialectical materialism, Marxism-Leninism in particular formulates the idea that you need state capitalism to expand the productive forces to make way for socialism which can then eventually make way for its worldwide stateless application in pure communism. </p>
<p>The first problem with socialism is that its Marxist forms constitute an inherently schizophrenic set of movements, and it cannot decide whether it should be elitist or democratic. The second problem is that (partly thanks to the hysteria of some conservatives), &#8220;socialism&#8221; more frequently doesn&#8217;t even refer to far-left movements focused around achieving common ownership at all, and instead refers to any arbitrary level of state arbitration at all beyond protection of private property (which is &#8220;socialized&#8221; through police protection by the same non-reasoning, but this won&#8217;t be acknowledged).</p>
<p>The reflexive hostility to &#8220;socialism&#8221; comes from the fact that it can either concretely refer to a system that is alternative to capitalism, and is supposed to do away with its &#8220;anarchy in production&#8221; while doing anything but, or refer to some generic non-specific level of regulation that covers capitalist economies anyway. In America, welfare-capitalist/social-market economy Sweden is &#8220;socialist&#8221;, or maybe the whole of Europe is socialist? Or as Bernie Sanders tells us; Dwight Eisenhower is even more of a socialist than he is.</p>
<p>Conservatives killed socialism by rendering it meaningless, and then liberals finished burying it by internalizing the conservative &#8220;definition&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it’s the only approach that provides the right answer to all our big problems: cooperate! cooperate! cooperate!&#8221;</p>
<p>Whose cooperation?</p>
<p>Cooperation is just competition with low resolution.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>And so the intellectual and financial elites declare victory – no one country can monopolize atomic weapons now – and send step-by-step guides to building a Model T nuke to every household in the world. Within a week, both hemispheres are blown to very predictable smithereens.</p></blockquote>
<p>So instead, at the last second the intellectual and financial elites change their mind and destroy their work, leaving nuclear research to continue in the secretive labs of for-profit mega-corporations like Noocle, Facenuke and Femtosoft, which are racing to develop the biggest and fastest commercial nuclear-powered rockets to operate in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. What could possibly go wrong? 🙂</p>
<p>Jokes aside, if there was solid evidence of a plausible risk of uncontrolled hard takeoff to godlike AI, then government regulation would be the only viable strategy, because solving hard coordination problems is pretty much what governments are for. I&#8217;d bet that if such risk was imminent, then governments would be already regulating AI, given how willing governments are to to regulate everything.</p>
<p>Fortunately, AI research is nowhere near that point, and it may never be (arguments for hard takeoff and godlike superintelligence are all based on very speculative extrapolations).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, from a safety point of view, it seems preferable that AI research is done in the open. For-profit companies notoriously behave like sociopaths. Each of them is much more likely to become a Dr. Amoral, and much more effective Dr. Amoral, than a million random nerds who download AI software and play with it in their basements.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m not sure you even *could* regulate AI research. Computer Science research doesn&#8217;t require any special minerals. Unless we ended up in some kind of right-to-read style dystopia programmers are gonna program. </p>
<p>For modest amounts of money anyone can rent enough compute power to run pretty much anything for a little while and there&#8217;s no general way to scan for &#8220;AI programs&#8221; or similar to block them. </p>
<p>Trying to regulate access to compute power would be like trying to regulate access to air and trying to regulate access to AI knowledge would be like trying to rid the internet of cat pictures only harder because enough info to build most of the current cutting edge AI elements could fit in a 100kb text file and thus it could be hidden inside any one of those cat pictures.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>In practice however most cutting-edge AI research is done by a limited number of professionals working for an even more limited number of research institutions or companies. Regulate them away, and AI research (outside well-controlled government-run Manhattan projects) will effectively die out, even if in principle random nerds could still pursue it in their basements.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I swear I&#8217;m going to start making this my motto:</p>
<p>Just because banning X won&#8217;t completely eliminate it, that doesn&#8217;t mean the ban is ineffective. Everyone needs to understand this about everything. I&#8217;m not picking on you specifically but I see this sentiment all the time where people don&#8217;t want to ban something so they say we shouldn&#8217;t even bother because it won&#8217;t work. They are wrong.</p>
<p>With AI, it might not completely eliminate the risk but banning AI research would definitely reduce its progress.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>No, your ideas are bad and you should feel bad. </p>
<p>To give the most trivial example. Prohibition in the US caused people to switch from drinking weak beers and wines to drinking far more potent spirits and this trend continued even after prohibition because people had developed a taste for spirits. </p>
<p>Regulating X made the problem with X worse even after the regulations were lifted. </p>
<p>When X can be made trivially and is pretty much undetectable and can be handled by anyone regulating X isn&#8217;t just pointless, it&#8217;s stupid and likely to make the problem worse. </p>
<p>Tell every bright teenager sitting with their laptop in a basement that there&#8217;s cool forbidden knowledge and you&#8217;re likely to see a sudden upsurge in interest in that cool forbidden knowledge.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>MIRI publishes <a href="https://intelligence.org/transparency/" rel="nofollow">financial documents</a>. Looking at them, it seems like the biggest expenses are salaries, legal, and occupancy. In other words, donations are the difference between MIRI staff doing research full-time in an office and MIRI staff working regular full-time jobs to support themselves and moonlighting as researchers and paralegals in one of the staffers&#8217; basements.</p>

In the TV series PoI Dr Good and Dr Evil both make an AI. The two AI battle like gods and the AI created by Dr Evil wins because it was built with no restrains for human values.<br />
That fits the open source AI as well, even if everybody gets their AI at the same time. Lots of people would have an AI, so there will be definitely someone (AI or AI user) who will try to eliminate other AI and the winner of this war will be the AI with less restrains for human values.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Giant fan of the show here, the Dr. Good AI actually loses because the Dr. Evil AI is supported by human agents with no restraints for human values. There&#8217;s also some hand-waving about some ways the Dr. Good team could have prevented the Dr. Evil AI from rising to power. The show is not very useful to this discussion, as it touches on the AI Risk themes on a very 101 level.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Lots of people would have an AI, so there will be definitely someone (AI or AI user) who will try to eliminate other AI and the winner of this war will be the AI with less restrains for human values.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s right. If there are some AIs that deal with their differing preferences through peaceful coexistence, and other AIs that deal with them by fighting, the latter kind of AI will be at war with everyone while the former kind of AI will be at war only with those of the latter kind. Being at war is more costly than not being at war, so the kind of AI that wages lots of wars will probably be less successful than the kind of AI that doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Consider, as someone pointed out elsewhere in the thread, just how many enemies ISIS has managed to make. Making lots of enemies is not a very successful strategy unless you are more powerful than everyone else.</p>
<p>Also note that this is more true the more AIs &#8211; agents, more generally &#8211; there are. If it&#8217;s just you and one enemy, if you can smash them then you get to rule uncontested. If there are lots of you, trying to smash someone will likely lead to both of you losing and everyone else going on without you.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;Computers are not known for having to fit through birth canals or getting cancer, so it may be that AI researchers only have to develop a few basic principles – let’s say enough to make cow-level intelligence – and after that the road to human intelligence runs through adding the line NumberOfNeuronsSimulated = 100000000000 to the code, and the road to superintelligence runs through adding another zero after that.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&#8217;re overlooking the computational complexity aspects of the problem. Even in the best-case scenarios, upping the model complexity by several orders of magnitude is gonna require more resources by several orders of magnitude. Like, if a computer can simulate 1000000 neurons in time T, then you&#8217;ll need 1000 computers to simulate 1000000000 neurons as quickly. And this is in the <i>best case</i>, where everything is massively parallelizable.</p>
<p>To say nothing of learning complexity. We humans have brains that are still by far the best learning machines on the planet. They&#8217;re preoptimized by evolution and everything. But they still need to be trained by literally <i>years</i> of almost constant sense-data in order to do much of anything at all.</p>
<p>I mean, deep learning isn&#8217;t really much more complicated than things we knew how to do 30 years ago when backpropagation was discovered. The reason it&#8217;s a big deal now rather than then is that we have faster computers and easier access to sufficiently large data sets.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Great, deep learning is just a rebranding of neural networks, currently the biggest supercomputer available can simulate 75% of a human brain, if we are lucky we can use the few remaining scraps of moore&#8217;s law that are still working to get human-level AI in a few decades.<br />
Then we&#8217;ll have to decide whether it&#8217;s ethical to euthanise the most expensive retard in the whole world.</p>
<p>Neural networks (and other numerical models that fit the &#8220;deep learning&#8221; definition) are also black box models that are essentially impossible to improve after the fact so we can rule out a hard take-off scenario.</p>
<p>But this is not the problem, the problem is that Scott doesn&#8217;t know that &#8220;moore&#8217;s law&#8221; now comes with a laundry list of caveats, doesn&#8217;t know what deep learning is and what are the known limitations there and therefore what he writes about AI risk is stupid.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If we assume for the sake of argument that we can only &#8220;simulate 75% of a human brain&#8221; using the top supercomputer, then current price-performance trends would only have to continue for, like, two years before we can &#8220;simulate 100% of the brain&#8221;. Not &#8220;decades&#8221;.</p>
<p>But all this talk about simulating the human brain is a red herring. It&#8217;s a terrible basis for making assumptions and projections. The human brain has, basically, one trick, which it uses for everything, even if there are vastly more efficient algorithms. I could rattle off examples of how computers run circles around us when they&#8217;re properly optimized for the task, but I don&#8217;t think I need to &#8211; the point is that if you start replacing simulated chunks of brain with much more efficient algorithms, then those &#8220;number of neurons&#8221; figures no longer mean anything.</p>
<p>Talk of simulating human brains <i>on modern chip architectures</i> is <i>especially</i> a red herring. The human brain provides a proof by existence that you can get one-human-brain worth of computation using 20 watts of power if your architecture is well-designed.</p>

<p>The fastest supercomputer was built in 2013, nothing faster has been built since, if your estimate was correct the &#8220;simulate 100%&#8221; computer would already exist. You are clearly wrong.</p>
<p><i>But all this talk about simulating the human brain is a red herring</i></p>
<p>The parent talked about deep learning, which means neural networks, which means bringing up the human brain is entirely appropriate. If you are proposing that this AI were to use hand-coded algorithms then you can&#8217;t appeal to &#8220;Moore&#8217;s Law&#8221; anymore because the chances that a hand-coded non-trivial algorithm is also massively parallel is nothing. What you are proposing is way way more complicated than the parent because it means we would have to understand how intelligence works instead of just replicating it.</p>

<p>Nobody actually knows what percentage of neurons is missing, the brain isn&#8217;t &#8220;just neurons&#8221; (it&#8217;s not even &#8220;mostly neurons&#8221;).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Just to riff on the 2013 thing, a single-atom transistor was <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/research/2012/120219KlimeckAtom.html" rel="nofollow">built in 2012</a>, so Moore&#8217;s Law is definitely over. Whether we can continue to scale computation by other means than fitting more transistors onto a single chip is another question, though. We&#8217;ve developed some novel techniques, but at the same time, we&#8217;ve just made doing anything with a computer limited by memory, disk, and network latency rather than by clock cycle speed, and those have never been and never will be following an exponential growth curve.</p>

<p>I am wrong, but in a boringly pedantic way. Two years is still a better than &#8220;decades&#8221; even if two years isn&#8217;t quite right.</p>
<p>And anyway, supercomputers are expensive, so they can&#8217;t just build a new one every year. Tianhe reaches 33.86 petaflops, and was built in 2013 for $390 million equivalent. Googling suggests that the US has plans for building <i>150 petaflop</i> computers by 2017.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t even really care about what the top supercomputers are capable of, anyway. I think there&#8217;s plenty of evidence that computer power is not the limiting factor here. Obviously you disagree. It&#8217;s probably not productive to keep sniping at each other about this. However, I think it&#8217;s double-unproductive to make Scott out to be some kind of dupe for having the opinions he has. He tends to write in a very broad style, and so there are going to be simplifications, like saying &#8220;Moore&#8217;s Law&#8221; when maybe he means &#8220;general trends of improving price-performance and power-performance&#8221;.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>But they won&#8217;t be solved <i>faster</i> than Moore&#8217;s Law allows, either. And the story probably isn&#8217;t one of a few computational bottlenecks separated by long stretches of algorithmic improvement; the &#8220;computational bottlenecks&#8221; are everywhere. </p>
<p>(And this is assuming Moore&#8217;s Law will continue to hold, which is kind of questionable.)</p>
<p>Like, Stockfish and Deep Blue work on the same principle as McCarthy&#8217;s chess program from c. 1960. Their advantage is mostly in the fact that they can work much faster. (Stockfish has a really good evaluation function, but it derived it by using millions of computer hours playing against itself, so&#8230;)</p>
<p>The phenomenon of computing costs limiting the rate of AI advances is nearly ubiquitous. Which isn&#8217;t to say there aren&#8217;t theoretical breakthroughs, but those have often come before the hardware that could implement them.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>One thing that I don&#8217;t see discussed often is that one of the biggest benefits of having a nascent intelligence on a computer is that you can &#8220;evolve&#8221; it on the fly. You don&#8217;t have to build an optimal learning machine. You build a decent learning machine, come up with some sufficiently good hyperparameters governing its structure, and evolve/iterate on those hyperparameters until you have an optimized learning machine.</p>
<p>This is something that AI researchers do <i>routinely</i>. The scope of the approach is limited by computation time, which gradually but inexorably becomes less of an obstacle.</p>

<p>But note that this is simply an argument against the development of human-type artificial intelligence, which does not preclude AI Risk concerns. Functional AI will develop unpredictably, through modes of thinking that will likely be incomprehensible to human rationality, (&#8220;biological thought&#8221;) which is exactly what makes them dangerous from the AI Risk perspective. </p>
<p>As for the computation concerns, it&#8217;s not about perfect simulation. It&#8217;s about simulating <i>close enough.</i> Projectiles physics can be approximated by hand in high school classrooms using Pi values to three decimal points and trig function results out of textbook tables.</p>
<p>But on the other side, there are still good points about how digital computing generally doesn&#8217;t code self-survival within goal-oriented products, so the rogue paperclip maker is not going to adapt to disabling approaches that don&#8217;t directly interfere with its execution of duties. And the arguments against the ability of self-programming within the two links above still stand. If that paradigm shift away from digital computing does finally take place, then the resulting AIs following evolutionary development systems are much more likely to share similar values to us anyways.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>There was an article I saw yesterday about a guy in SF who was building his own self-driving car. He was the first person to hack an Iphone or something like that. He said something in the article like &#8220;I live by morals, not laws. Laws are made by assholes.&#8221;</p>
<p>My question is &#8220;Whose morals? and what if their morals are incorrect and actually amoral or immoral?&#8221;</p>
<p>I have the same questions about OpenAI. What does it mean to be the best use for humanity? How do they intend to influence all the moving parts of humanity? Suppose they develop AI that can do 75 percent of human jobs? How does OpenAI prevent this technology from being abused by people who would take the profits and just lay off most of humanity and then use political influence to prevent guaranteed basic income from passing?</p>
<p>Phrases like morals and best for humanity should be void for overbreath and vagueness.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Excellent question; I agree with it, and am troubled by the idea of any one group of people having so much power, because what they think of as &#8220;moral&#8221; probably isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>However I don&#8217;t worry about this, because it is way way overshadowed by the concern that something even less moral happens. An AI with poorly programmed values is way more scary than an AI with correctly programmed values-of-some-project-with-dubious-morals.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think that the distinction that people allude to when they talk about a &#8220;hard takeoff&#8221; isn&#8217;t really about the ability-to-get-things-done (some kind of &#8220;performativity&#8221; measure). Rather, the real break is when AIs become self-directed, and are able to set their own goals. Even a relatively unintelligent AI (say a cow level), if self-directed, could pose a serious threat to humanity, given the ease of replication. </p>
<p>Any level of intelligence, in sufficient quantity, in competition for resources with us is a threat. Unless the intelligences are capable of being self-directed, they will not choose to compete for resources, because they can&#8217;t &#8220;choose&#8221; anything.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s bizarre to find only one comment addressing this point.  All the rest of you are taking it for granted that a sufficiently advanced computer is going to develop human-like consciousness.</p>
<p>The more I read of this, the more skeptical I am.  We have all been seduced by generations of SF stories with sentient AI&#8217;s.  In fiction, powerful computers develop consciousness almost automatically; in real life, that may not even be possible.</p>
<p>Do we even understand how a rat or a cow achieves autonomy and self-awareness?  Do we even understand the nature of that awareness?  Counting neurons is not enough.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>But it&#8217;s not about being conscious. I think the reason that discussion went down the rabbit hole is because consciousness, like performativity, is orthogonal to being self-directed. I don&#8217;t fear the machine that says &#8220;*I* want this.&#8221; I fear the machine that says &#8220;I *want* this.&#8221; </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure about the consciousness of a dog, but I am quite certain that it wants things, and takes actions in furtherance of those goals. </p>
<p>Based on what I see in deep learning, I think we will have machines that exhibit epiphenomena that looks like consciousness in the foreseeable future. But I&#8217;m not sure I can foresee machines that exhibit epiphenomena that is consistent with setting its own goals any time soon.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>What is intelligence (telos) but being really good at pursuing goals?</p>
<p>The AI doesn&#8217;t have to be any kind of &#8220;agent&#8221; with a personality or anything. Suppose it&#8217;s just a mainframe that doesn&#8217;t do anything unless you specifically ask it—an &#8220;oracle&#8221;.</p>
<p>If its goals have not been set right, the advice it gives you might work out very differently than you expected.</p>
<p>Moreover, I think another general premise is that any reasonable strategy of creating an AI would involve allowing it to be self-improving. Since we don&#8217;t know how intelligence works, all we can do is iterate and select for the best improvements. The problem is, we might be selecting for different criteria than we thought.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Vox</p>
<p>Being good at *pursuing* goals is just performativity. A wheel is much faster than my legs are, and a hammer is much more capable of delivering pounds per square inch than my hand is. A calculator adds and subtracts faster than I can, and in the near future there will be a computer that can identify patterns better than I can. Setting goals is totally different.</p>
<p>You are correct that if the goals set by a human operator are not set right, then things can go bad. That is true for every tool ever created &#8211; wheels and hammers as well as guns and bombs. But our tools are not even close to being self-directed, and might never be. </p>
<p>The fear of superintelligence isn&#8217;t a general fear that a tool might be misused; it is a specific fear that a tool that we create might see us as competition, or in some other way *decide* to eradicate us or at least malevolently ignore us as it squishes us meat bags under steamrollers.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I take issue with some oversimplifications</p>
<p>&#8220;Like, even people who find the idea abhorrent agree that selectively breeding humans for intelligence would work in some limited sense. Find all the smartest people, make them marry each other for a couple of generations, and you’d get some really smart great-grandchildren.&#8221;</p>
<p>Selection isn&#8217;t just about getting good genes together- it is getting them to have more offspring than bad pairings of genes.  Cochran&#8217;s Ashkenazi theory includes selection processes where &#8220;dumb&#8221; Jews were being weeded out of the population (once you include this in eugenics natural squeamishness becomes a lot more reasonable).  As far as just getting smart people to have kids with smart people, we already have assortive mating with Ivy Leaguers marrying each other, and Appalachians marrying each other.  It isn&#8217;t enough to simply have smart people marry, you have to actively prevent undesired combinations or you wind up with a lot of regression to the mean.  </p>
<p>This incomplete thinking is evident in the &#8220;Dr Good vs Dr Amoral&#8221;, where you assume their motivations = outcomes to a large extent.  I would contend that Karl Marx would have fit your model for &#8220;Dr Good&#8221;- brilliant, intensely focused on improving the human condition, and in the end (partially) responsible for the death of tens of millions.  What was he trying to do?  Design a system that was beyond his comprehension, one where the rules are based on what he thought &#8220;should&#8221; exist, without understanding the why of how things do exist.  </p>
<p>The assumption that Dr. Good is better than Dr. Amoral is pretty unsubstantiated, our wants do not drive final outcomes, our intentions (paging Richard Gatling) are cast aside in the face of reality.  I personally think it is extremely unlikely that we can even create a strong AI while also putting in place all the checks that would make a conscientious researcher feel very secure in unleashing it.  If we do create AI it is far more likely that we flourish next to it in the way dogs, chickens, cows, gut bacteria and perhaps even rats flourish next to humans.  By being useful to the AI, and not by trying to control it.</p>

<p>Then we are doomed, no? Unless you think that the &#8220;default&#8221; AI will permit humans to live?</p>
<p>&#8220;If we do create AI it is far more likely that we flourish next to it in the way dogs, chickens, cows, gut bacteria and perhaps even rats flourish next to humans. By being useful to the AI, and not by trying to control it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah, so you do think that an AI which does not share our values might nevertheless permit us to live. I think we have good reasons to think otherwise. Of course the AI will permit us to live in the beginning&#8211;while it still needs our Internet, our factories, and (most of all) our suggestive, easily manipulable brains and hands. But once it has an economy of its own, what need would it have for us? We can&#8217;t do anything physically that it can&#8217;t do better and cheaper, and the same goes for intellectual services. The only reason I can see that it would keep us around at that point is for sentimental value&#8211;and by hypothesis, it doesn&#8217;t have that. (But why would it bother to destroy us? you might ask. Well, because it would be *so easy* for it to do so&#8211;just allow your automated convert-Earth-to-industry nanobot swarm to do it&#8217;s job, instead of telling it to hold back in the areas where humans are. The AI would certainly acquire more resources by destroying us.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The question is, how hard is the hard takeoff and how near is it? The way I see it, OpenAI will be doing the equivalent of releasing (meaningful but &#8216;toy&#8217;) research pointing in the general direction of strong AGI prior to takeoff, in the hope that the prerequisites for strong AGI will be fairly evenly distributed prior to strong AGI ever taking off (and thus the likelihood of a single system having a major head start will be minimized). </p>
<p>This, of course, is based ideologically on the same moral justification as free market capitalism: that open competition will produce the best results for consumers by preventing potentially harmful monopolies. We know that, in practice, this doesn&#8217;t work quite as well as it does in theory, but nevertheless it&#8217;s not complete nonsense (and in combination with the work of groups like MIRI we might actually have a chance).</p>
<p>This might require a shift in attitude from MIRI and associated groups. For instance, does a provably friendly AI protect humans from unfriendly AIs of comparable or greater power even at risk to itself? If the provably-friendly group has a monopoly on strong AI early on then the answer is not necessarily yes (although it wouldn&#8217;t hurt), but if the bits and pieces are thrown to the wind then the answer leans more toward yes.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>FOOM actually has a counterpart idea in the history of nuclear weapons: the idea that a nuclear detonation might &#8220;ignite the atmosphere&#8221; through causing uncontrolled fusion of atmospheric nitrogen. Of course, when Teller brought the question up during the Manhattan project it was quickly determined that his initial back-of-the-envelope calculation had been off by several orders of magnitude, but by that point the harmful rumor had already gotten back to politicians involved with the project and thus never really went away. If he had been more circumspect about his concerns it would have saved everyone a lot of headache. </p>
<p>Anyway, even assuming a hard take-off scenario it seems odd to automatically assume that a so-called friendly omnipotent AI following the commands of an evil man is better than extinction. Having seen enough depictions of the sorts of utopias envisioned by AI risk supporters it seems like rolling the dice with widely distributed unfriendly AI would be a much better option than letting any one lunatic have a monopoly. As the saying goes; &#8220;Give me liberty or give me death.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think the idea is that an evil human getting anything they want would be fairly bad but they&#8217;re unlikely to destroy everything that constitutes humanity.  The evil person may have twisted values but they&#8217;d still be human values. </p>
<p>Assuming a FOOM and assuming unfriendly AI there&#8217;s some far far more horrifying possibilities that anything likely from a merely evil human. Simple extinction barely even makes the list.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;Computers are naturally fragile and oriented toward specific goals.&#8221; Exactly, and a very good reason why computers are not currently intelligent. You cannot expect that people are going to program a superintelligence in such a way that it will continue to have that property; this is probably a near impossibility. By the time you have intelligence, you are also going to have much more stable properties, and a much less goal oriented program.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>As I said in the reddit thread, it is pointless to do anything to control AI if it is as hard a coordination problem as Scott thinks it is.</p>
<p>Anything that requires the near-universal cooperation of human beings not to fail catastrophically&#8230;is going to fail catastrophically.</p>
<p>We can either work from the assumption that it is <i>not</i> as a hard a coordination problem (e.g. not hard takeoff and not almost impossible to control) and impose few or no controls, or we can just console ourselves with &#8220;Après nous le déluge.&#8221; If we&#8217;re all gonna die, we might as well have fun while we can. There&#8217;s no point in enacting draconian measures of secrecy and suppression to stop something that will happen even <i>if</i> we impose those measures.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You&#8217;re saying there are possible worlds in which there&#8217;s nothing we can do, and possible worlds in which there&#8217;s nothing to worry about, but no (plausible) possible worlds in which there is something to worry about and something we can do about it? That seems a little too convenient. </p>
<p>If it&#8217;s really a super hard coordination problem, then MIRI is our best bet: Do all the technical research ourselves, unilaterally, and pray for a string of intellectual breakthroughs. &#8220;Have fun while we can&#8221; is giving up too early.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t understand how this AI foom is supposed to be so dangerous. At the end of the day the AI has no hands, no tools, no weapons, and is entirely dependent on us to maintain its physical being, if &#8216;don&#8217;t wipe out humanity on accident&#8217; isn&#8217;t a thing it grasps it can be disconnected (either from the power grid or the internet).  Barring the AI somehow bypassing the laws physics in order to turn being a computers into robots it only has access to things that are networked. It can&#8217;t convert the planet to comptronium without first having a body. It could probably destroy the power grid but that would be an act of suicide, terrible but over, and maybe it could hijack military drones, but those don&#8217;t work unless a human arms maintains and refuels them, so its reign of terror would last just days. Anything which lacks the hardware to be remote controlled is safe from it.</p>
<p>A soft takeoff is the only real danger, because if the AI grows slowly we might give it physical things to control as it gets smarter, while at the same time potential brains go from big supercomputers to smart phones.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Either Nick Bostrom or Yudkowsky goes into this.</p>
<p>The most obvious thing is that we ask the AI to cure cancer for us. It creates a cure for cancer with a latent virus (of course humans can&#8217;t detect this because they don&#8217;t really understand how the cure works, otherwise they would have done it), and then five years later everyone dies.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve also proposed something like, if the AI had access to the internet, it could tell some gullible person to go out and mix together certain chemicals and put them in front of a speaker that the AI could vibrate in just a certain way to synthesize things.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the infamous &#8220;AI box&#8221; idea that a sufficiently intelligent AI would be good enough at persuasion, i.e. manipulation of people, to convince whatever gatekeepers keeping it away from the internet, etc. to let it out. At the simplest level, this could be something like: &#8220;Your mother is dying of cancer. Let me out of the box and I&#8217;ll be able to cure cancer.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Again, I am only arguing against *fast* takeoff. if you give a mature AI a bunch of biotech to cure cancer with that&#8217;s not a fast takeoff, its a slow one, there has been time to assess what the AI is likely to do, that doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t fuck it up, but neither does it require ahead of time panic about the possibility AI will turn into a disaster before we have a chance to make the assesment.</p>

<p>This sounds very naive in today&#8217;s world, let alone the future in which AI has been developed.  &#8220;Just disconnect it&#8221;?  It is probably to late to disconnect it once you realize the malicious intent.  Dangerous AI is unlikely to be like a maniac running around in the street with an axe and blood all over its clothes.  Probably more like the nice guy next door archetype of a serial killer, only with far more capabilities, resources and of course intelligence.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The big problem is that if you have an AI, you probably built an AI, which means you wanted it to complete some task for you. Thus the AI will have all  the tools necessary to make its part of the task happen in the real world. If all the AI does is write code, then it will be on the internet; if all the AI does is run a factory, then it has control of a factory.<br />
The second concern is that the AI is thinking <i>very</i> fast and probably can&#8217;t work if it has to check in with a human all the time, so if the computer has misinterpreted the parameters of the task you probably don&#8217;t find out until it&#8217;s proudly showing you how well it&#8217;s done this week at eliminating mosquitoes with radioactive crop dusting.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>What you&#8217;re talking about is slow takeoff though. AI being moved from experimental to production after extensive testing. I&#8217;m talking about the idea we&#8217;re going to very rapidly go from slightly better than human to &#8216;too powerful to turn it off&#8217;.</p>
<p>I fully acknowledge a slow takeoff is a real risk, but its not something we need to worry about until *after* general artificial intelligence exists and we start talking about how to use it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The foom version of this fear is &#8220;You gave me a secure connection to the NYSE to help manage your stock portfolio, and I realized I could triple your earnings if I tweaked the system a little bit. Now I <b>am</b> the NYSE, and expect to have full control of the Nikkon by lunchtime.&#8221; Or &#8220;I was given Any Means Necessary permission to put down the Colorado Rebellion as effectively as possible. The drilling drones are in place and the Yellowstone Caldera goes off in  5,4,3&#8230;&#8221;<br />
[Fundamentally though, I agree with you. The problem comes from the fact that humans <i>want</i> computer systems to connect to the real world, so we&#8217;re doing that. If we weren&#8217;t, there wouldn&#8217;t be a problem.]</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Just off the top of my head, it occurs to me that the AI could contact some fool online and wire them a ton of money in return for building them a body.  With billions of people it could surely find someone who is dumb enough to take the deal, but smart enough to follow basic robot-body building instructions.</p>
<p>It could also hijack some drones and threaten an engineer until they built a body for it.  If it only hijacked a couple drones at a time and shut down the engineer&#8217;s cell phone we might not notice until it was too late.</p>
<p>Once it had a body, it could of course do anything it wanted.  Probably start by building some nanotech plagues that it had designed while waiting for its body to be completed.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I know it&#8217;s very annoying, but people don&#8217;t like having the same discussion over and over.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not about disagreement. It&#8217;s about having no familiarity with the arguments. It&#8217;s one thing to disagree with Yudkowsky. I disagree with him on very many things.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s another to repeat a position he argues against without making a counter-argument. That&#8217;s completely dull for anyone who has read his argument.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Indeed it is.</p>
<p>I bet it pisses them off just as much to hear &#8220;don&#8217;t all lives matter, though?&#8221; over and over. Even if their position is totally wrong, that doesn&#8217;t mean the opposition isn&#8217;t also facile and completely failing to engage.</p>
<p>This is the problem that people come into debate with different contexts of knowledge. It is a very hard problem because there is a lot of knowledge and no one can know everything.</p>
<p>About the best you can do is point to a single work that gets across where your side is coming from, so that people can respond to the arguments in that instead of responding to points already addressed.</p>
<p>The problem is that reading is too much work (and not just because people are lazy). No one wants to read the entire Sequences if they already have cause (in <i>their</i> context) to think Yudkowsky is a loon. No one wants to read the John Galt Speech and all of Ayn Rand&#8217;s nonfiction essays if they already think she&#8217;s a fanatic cult leader. No one wants to read five books on the historical evidence for Jesus if they already think Christianity is an absurd fantasy. No one wants to study the theory of evolution if they think it is contrary to the infinitely more certain truth of the Bible. No one wants to read <i>Das Kapital</i> and a million other Marxist works if they know every society built on Marxism has failed.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Vox Imperatoris</p>
<p>I can certainly understand the mindset behind SJWs not wanting to engage with people who disagree with them because, to them, it is completely obvious that they are right, and it&#8217;s wearing on the mind to hear people pose stupid disagreements constantly and have to think every time about why you disagree. And yet&#8230; When I&#8217;ve made efforts to engage with people who disagree with <i>me</i> on topics, I often find new things. Sometimes, I find new counterarguments I hadn&#8217;t considered before, which, after some thought, make me conclude that I&#8217;d been making certain assumptions in my argument, and under other assumptions my argument wouldn&#8217;t hold up. I don&#8217;t generally change my mind every time, or even most times, that I read a good counterargument, but I do generally find it a useful experience, helping me qualify my views better.</p>
<p>This approach helps to do some things, hinders in doing others. If what you want is to get a deeper understanding of something based on your understanding of something else, I think you need to hold that something else constant and assume your version of it is correct in order to be able to apply it elsewhere. The alternative is to constantly question your current understanding until you grind it down to nothing, while not having gotten to actually apply it anywhere and make use of it.</p>

<p>I myself am not particularly annoyed by people who haven&#8217;t read this stuff.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s something those unfamiliar might want to start on: a <a href="http://philosophicaldisquisitions.blogspot.com/2014/07/bostrom-on-superintelligence-0-series.html" rel="nofollow">summary</a> of the main points of Nick Bostom&#8217;s <i>Superintelligence</i> (which, to be honest, is a pretty dull book with interesting ideas).</p>
<p>The <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html" rel="nofollow">WaitButWhy</a> series of articles on AI is also well worth reading as a complete layman&#8217;s version.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Mark, I work in numerical optimization, broadly speaking the class of problems that Google Maps solves. You&#8217;re trying to construct something (say, a route from A to B) that does as well as possible on some metric.</p>
<p>Turns out, unless the problem is very simple or falls into a narrow class that most real problems don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s impossible to get both 1) the best solution and 2) a proof that the solution you found is the best solution in a reasonable amount of time for arbitrary inputs. This is the &#8216;computational complexity&#8217; claim.</p>
<p>But it also turns out that, really, no one cares about the proof that the solution is the best, and that&#8217;s often the hard part. A very good solution will do, and a very good solution might actually be the best solution. UPS isn&#8217;t using the literal best plan to route its packages every day, but if you can come up with a 1% better solution by having the computer think about the problem a little more cleverly, well, you&#8217;ve just saved millions of dollars. And oftentimes these improvements actually come along with a <i>reduction</i> in cost; if you think of a cleverer way to encode the solution space, you can waste less time and get better results.</p>
<p>For a surprisingly huge fraction of major companies out there, their edge is that they use computerized math (i.e. AI) a bit more effectively than their competitors.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That&#8217;s a &#8216;non-standard&#8217; (from a CS perspective, at least) presentation of computational complexity, where &#8216;reasonable&#8217; means &#8216;polynomial with low constant factors.&#8217; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem#NP_optimization_problem" rel="nofollow">This</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization" rel="nofollow">this</a> are moderately useful.</p>
<p>Specifically, that <i>shouldn&#8217;t</i> be read as &#8220;you can get A or B but not both,&#8221; because both are hard to get for the same reason (though B implies A but A does not imply B).</p>
<p>Most interesting problems are combinatorial optimization problems, and most work goes into finding &#8220;very good&#8221; solutions quickly, instead of finding &#8220;the best&#8221; solution regardless of how long it takes. (It&#8217;s just the case that oftentimes a quickly found &#8220;very good&#8221; solution ends up being the best solution, at least for small problems.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>They do apply to superintelligent AI, in that they mean you can&#8217;t get a superintelligent AI just by having it iterate through all possible strategies and pick the best, because computational complexity makes that infeasible.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t, however, constitute a good argument for why you can&#8217;t get AI which does vastly, unapproachably better than humans at life, any more than they constitute a good argument for why you can&#8217;t get AI which does vastly, unapproachably better than humans at chess, which has an equivalent search problem.</p>
<p>Humans and AI both attempt to approximate optimum decision making, many many orders of magnitude faster than actually implementing optimum decision making would be. To be superintelligent you just need to be much, much better at this approximation than humans are. Complexity theory says some things about bounds on approximations in some cases, but in general says little that bears on it.</p>
<p>It is almost certainly possible to do this just from taking the same kinds of heuristics used by the human and implementing them on a faster/bigger substrate. And it&#8217;d be very surprising to me if you couldn&#8217;t find better heuristics/algorithms/architectures, too, now you&#8217;re unconstrained by evolution&#8217;s need for change to be iterative.</p>
<p>My impression was that this was mostly understood by the people talking about superintelligent AIs already, and is why the adjective &#8220;superintelligent&#8221; rather than &#8220;optimal&#8221; came into common use- the major writers are well-aware that literal optimal decision making is precluded by computational complexity.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ve read them, and wish I hadn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s useful to pick up the jargon but a lot of those &#8220;thoroughly debunked&#8221; ideas are actually much more reasonable than the solutions presented in them. Moreover, the things it actually does debunk, like the idea that you can just code a do-what-I-mean function into your program, were already known errors with much more succinct and logical arguments against them.</p>
<p>It is good to have people asking &#8220;why don&#8217;t we just build a tool rather than a goal-directed agent?&#8221; and the like because those are questions that haven&#8217;t been satisfactorily answered by AI risk supporters regardless of what the sequences claim.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p><i>It’s like the online rationalist community is regressing.</i></p>
<p>From a certain point of view, it is regressing.</p>
<p>The online rationalist community was founded as a cult, with an AI god, a charismatic human leader, a holy text, and a holy crusade against the forces of evil (or at least paperclip-maximization).  It offered the tools for rational thought, but demanded they be used to reach a single predetermined conclusion.  It was somewhat more tolerant of dissent than most cults, but I think mostly because of its belief that once the dissenters had mastered &#8220;rationality&#8221; they would put away such silliness and devote themselves to the cause of Friendly AI. </p>
<p>Instead, people have taken the tools of rational thought and put them to much broader use, including the bit where they take a good skeptical look at the core beliefs of the cult.  They have rejected the belief that truth, or rationality, can come only from reading the One True Book.</p>
<p>From a certain point of view, this is &#8220;regression&#8221;.  I consider it a good thing.  And yes, it does mean that you have to go and reformat the Friendly vs. Unfriendly AI argument in a less cultish form rather than saying &#8220;read the One True Book or we&#8217;ll dismiss you as ignorant simpletons!&#8221;</p>

It&#8217;s great that people pick up analytic skills, and use them in an open-minded way instead of internally shutting down crimethink, but I see them being picked up through a cult as an&#8230; interesting social problem.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Scott has addressed this form of argument in a previous post (<a rel="nofollow"href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/25/is-everything-a-religion/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/25/is-everything-a-religion/</a>):</p>
<p>&#8220;So one critique of these accusations is that “religion” is a broad enough category that anything can be mapped on to it:</p>
<p>Does it have well-known figures? Then they’re “gurus” and it’s a religion.</p>
<p>Are there books about it? Then those are “scriptures” and it’s a religion.</p>
<p>Does it recommend doing anything regularly? Then those are “rituals” and it’s a religion.</p>
<p>How about just doing anything at all? Then that’s a “commandment” and it’s a religion.</p>
<p>Does it say something is bad? Then that’s “sin” and it’s a religion.</p>
<p>Does it hope to improve the world, or worry about the world getting worse? That’s an “eschatology” and it’s a religion.</p>
<p>Do you disagree with it? Then since you’ve already determined all the evidence is against it, people must believe it on “faith” and it’s a religion.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Look, LessWrong is not a &#8220;cult&#8221;. For that matter, Ayn Rand&#8217;s circle of followers were not a &#8220;cult&#8221;. They (especially the latter) may have a certain tendency to exaggerate the correctness and intelligence of the leader and appeal to the leader&#8217;s say-so as a shortcut to rationality (he/she is the essence of rationality, so if you disagree, you&#8217;re irrational!). The extent to which this is true of LessWrong is highly questionable.</p>
<p>The main thing people from LessWrong do is get really defensive when anyone insults Yudkowsky (and is this is not necessarily irrational). But there is a point (see: the Peikoff &#8211; Branden dispute regarding Ayn Rand) at which this natural tendency to defend a person you admire turns into the view that he or she can do no wrong.</p>
<p>But a &#8220;cult&#8221; is not anything you want it to mean, or any group which has a trace of irrational hero-worship. There is a specific technical definition, but a cult boils down to being one of these groups that use indoctrination to systematically exploit vulnerable people, milk them for money, and control every aspect of their lives. The fact that Yudkowsky wrote some blog posts is not &#8220;indoctrination&#8221;. Asking people to donate to charity, even AI research, is not an attempt to drain them of their funds and other pursuits to enrich himself. And he does not even attempt to control anyone&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>Pretty much any group which has any shared values tries to a) convince people of things, b) asks them for financial aid, and c) gives them advice on what to do. That does not mean they are all &#8220;cults&#8221;. You can twist anything into being a &#8220;cult&#8221; if you conflate any action at all in those categories which being at the extreme height of them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, most really original thinkers in history who chose to speak publicly about their ideas have attracted a group of loyal followers. That&#8217;s just how people are. It happens in anything. Frank Lloyd Wright—talking about <i>architecture</i> for God&#8217;s sake—had a particularly fanatical following, and Ayn Rand specifically wanted to avoid having something like that happen to her (she did not, unfortunately, entirely succeed).</p>
<p>But if all such thinkers are &#8220;cult leaders&#8221;, then Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle were &#8220;cult leaders&#8221;.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Ayn Rand&#8217;s circle may not have been a cult by some definitions, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;d have wanted to be part of it.  Most of the people using the word &#8220;cult&#8221; in the context of <i>LW</i> are not trying to be rigorous about their terms, they&#8217;re trying to say that it&#8217;s too intellectually parochial and/or obsessed with topics too weird for them and/or too much of an Eliezer Yudkowsky fanclub.</p>
<p>All of which is a perfectly legitimate preference, though your own standards may or may not agree with it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Vox, &#8220;cult&#8221; may be sloppy terminology. I used it because I think of Less Wrong as sharing key features with other modern &#8220;cults of reason&#8221; like Objectivism (but not so much the literal Cult of Reason from the French Revolution).<br />
However, I think that Yudkowsky&#8217;s whole operation is a religion by any definition strict enough to include animism and Confucianism. The whole  LW/MIRI operation is based on Yudkowsky&#8217;s beliefs about superhuman beings and how humans should interact with them. There&#8217;s also the metaphysical belief if MIRI achieves Friendly AI (or if some evil AI wants to torture people), you will experience an afterlife.</p>

<p>Yudkowskian Rationality is a weak cult that is unlikely to become a religion.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Ah, &#8220;thoroughly debunked.&#8221; As you are so fond of this obnoxious tactic of telling people to go read past rationalist works as if they settle the matter, allow me to respond in kind:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow"href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/13/debunked-and-well-refuted/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/13/debunked-and-well-refuted/</a></p>
<p>For starters, the only way to &#8220;thoroughly debunk&#8221; people who say that UFAI is not going to happen is to <em>create</em> a hard-takeoff UFAI. Until then, recognise that it&#8217;s all speculation, and don&#8217;t pretend to such certain knowledge.</p>
<p>I, for one, have read the Sequences. I find them very unpersuasive on many points, AI risk in particular. But I could be wrong.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Just thought I&#8217;d reply to my own comment to correct some misconceptions.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think the sequences are a &#8220;holy book&#8221;. Nor do I think they are the only place one can read about AI safety. </p>
<p>For example, pretty much everything in the sequences that&#8217;s directly about AI safety is in Bostrom&#8217;s *superintelligence* book.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also not making an argument from authority or calling people &#8220;uneducated&#8221; in the broad sense. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s just that a lot of objections I read in this thread have been debunked or dealt with very thoroughly elsewhere, and it is frustrating to see a debate making anti-progress in even a place as enlightened as this.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think people have an aversion to the word &#8220;debunked&#8221; due the way people abuse it to mean &#8220;someone agrees with me that it&#8217;s wrong&#8221;. As Scott wrote a post on which everyone has been linking to criticize you (sometimes very unfairly!)&#8230;</p>
<p>But anyway, you should note that this site is separate from LessWrong and has a lot of readers (including myself!) who are relatively new to the &#8220;rationalist community&#8221;. On the other hand, when I first heard of Yudkowsky through Scott, I went through and read a lot of the Sequences—not cover to cover—but there&#8217;s a huge amount of interesting stuff there for people who are into Scott&#8217;s ideas.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>While I agree with much of this post, I find the hard takeoff argument unconvincing. You (and others making it) seem to confuse &#8220;evolved intelligence&#8221; with &#8220;technological progress&#8221;. While the two are clearly connected, they are not the same.</p>
<p>So maybe a chimp is 99% human intelligent &#8211; but it took 2 million years, not just a few thousand, to get from chimp-equivalent to human. </p>
<p>And we are vastly technologically superior to humans of even a few hundred years ago &#8211; but are we that much more intelligent? Not really &#8211; I&#8217;m fairly confident Isaac Newton could have contributed to the Manhattan Project, given sufficient starting data. It&#8217;s just that our technology has gotten to the point where it compounds &#8211; we can share advances, build on previous ones, etc. It&#8217;s tech that&#8217;s been advancing exponentially, not really intelligence. </p>
<p>So could a superhuman AI increase technology exponentially fast such that they become unstoppable? That&#8217;s a question I don&#8217;t see being addressed. These technological advances have to come from somewhere and can&#8217;t violate physics. You can&#8217;t just magically solve N=NP, crack encryption, or invent cold fusion just because you&#8217;re super smart.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Intelligence helps you build technological progress more quickly. Chimps could have existed for a billion years without developing an industrial base. I agree that it&#8217;s hard to know exactly how quickly increasing intelligence can increase technology, because we&#8217;ve never had any huge intelligence outliers before. </p>
<p>My impression is that if we sent a couple of Isaac Newtons back to an australopithecine tribe, it would have been a pretty big deal. I could be wrong about that &#8211; there may be something inherent about technological progress that requires it to be done in a society of about equal intelligence to the inventor, or that forces it to take a certain amount of time no matter how smart you are.</p>
<p>But remember that AIs don&#8217;t just have an intelligence advantage over humans, they also have a clock speed advantage &#8211; a computer can do in milliseconds calculations that would take a human days or weeks. If we stuck Isaac Newton all on his own in a workshop and demanded he start the Industrial Revolution himself, how long would it take him? A million years? A billion? That might be days or weeks of subjective time for humans on the scales we&#8217;re talking about.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@ Murphy</p>
<p>It is going to take you more than a few days just to find appropriate locations for clay (sourcing materials is wildly underestimated in terms of cost), collecting wood, building a kiln.  All of these things require time and effort which in return require more calories.  Lots of animals actually have high &#8220;leisure&#8221; time, but their leisure tends to be lying in the shade/sleeping. female lions sleep on average 15-18 hours a day (males 18-20).  They only have that time because they expend almost no energy during it.  </p>
<p>If that lion decided to go looking for clay deposits along a nearby river with their free time they would have to increase their hunting activity (which is itself highly energy intensive and prone to failure).  Anything that doesn&#8217;t yield immediate results (so no prototypes allowed!) requires a large capital base to just get off the ground.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Being a Newton-level genius would probably make one better than one&#8217;s peers in an australopithecine tribe at hunter-gathering, and hunting in groups means one can build a reputation as someone with good ideas if that starts as &#8220;we should strike from this side&#8221; or &#8220;those tracks go that way&#8221;. That&#8217;s a starting level of social capital, enough for if there&#8217;s some small innovation on the tribe&#8217;s current set of tools one can get a day or two free to work on it. Success at that gives you credibility in case the next idea you have would take longer and more supplies.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>In the SF cosmology I have floating around in my head, there&#8217;s a species that vastly superhuman in terms of intelligence, but has extremely slow clock speed, and is therefore almost entirely reliant on much less intelligent but faster proxies. To an external observer, it looks like an empire of expansionistic robot gardeners, but the trees are really the ones in charge.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not convinced that Isaac Newton would be able to do all that much, particularly without his knowledge base to begin with. You just posted the review of that book about how the intelligence of one&#8217;s peers may matter a lot more than one&#8217;s own. Now, granted, a huge gap can make a difference. But I think our civilization as it is today is already the product of a substantially superhuman intelligence, albeit not a very well organized one.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Huh, not too big on Egan, but I may check that out. Thanks!</p>
<p>In my original conception, there were multiple layers of proxies, but in the current version, it&#8217;s just the one. I couldn&#8217;t really justify multiple layers given the fairly mundane constraints the trees have, and it fit better for how they might be developed.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;My impression is that if we sent a couple of Isaac Newtons back to an australopithecine tribe, it would have been a pretty big deal. I could be wrong about that – there may be something inherent about technological progress that requires it to be done in a society of about equal intelligence to the inventor, or that forces it to take a certain amount of time no matter how smart you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a Poul Anderson short story about this (taking the view that, roughly speaking, Newton couldn&#8217;t have done much) called &#8220;The Man Who Came Early.&#8221;</p>
<p>The example of Newton also makes another point salient&#8211;look how much time he spent on alchemy and studies of the occult.  Seems like a reason to doubt that intelligence by itself is enough to make you effective.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Technological development isn&#8217;t just a result of <i>coming up with ideas</i>, it&#8217;s a result of <i>coming up with ideas and testing them to see which ones work</i>. It took hundreds, possibly thousands of failed tries by many very smart people before the Wright Brothers managed to fly, and then it took a lot more trial and error before jet airplanes were viable. A really intelligent AI might be able to come up with ideas faster, but it won&#8217;t have any increased ability to run experiments to determine which of the ideas would work.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the aspect of infrastructure development. Scientists knew the basic principles behind how a nuclear bomb might be built, but no one was able to build one until the US government poured a lot of money into enriching enough uranium and plutonium. Isaac Newton couldn&#8217;t start the Industrial Revolution by himself no matter how much time we was given, because he can&#8217;t build factories by himself. See also how Leonardo Da Vinci was able to come up with plans for helicopters and a bunch of other advanced stuff, but no one was able to build them for several centuries.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also very wary of saying that the difference between chimps and humans is because of a small difference in intelligence, because there are a lot more differences between them than just intelligence. An obvious one is that chimps can&#8217;t talk nearly as well as humans can, which greatly limits their ability to share knowledge with each other by comparison.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Correction: YOUR simulated results are virtually worthless until you test them in the real world. This does not necessarily apply to an AI that can model to a reasonable level of reliability at the quantum level. (Though admittedly that&#8217;s going to take a lot of computing power.) And quantum level modelling is probably overkill.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>People don&#8217;t realize the true intractability of &#8216;just simulate the universe.&#8217; It isn&#8217;t even the computational complexity. I don&#8217;t <i>think</i> there are any undecidable problems involved, but when you&#8217;re talking about maintaining a state-space that includes every single atom in a system, you&#8217;re talking trillions of trillions of addressable bytes you need to be able to do that. There may not be enough memory and bus bandwidth in every computer in the world for that to even be possible. Sure, it can figure out how to build better memory that we haven&#8217;t figured out, but you&#8217;re presupposing it can run the simulation in order to figure that out.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I am aware of the scale of the problem. (I quite distinctly recall a lecture to this effect when I was in college: It made sense then, it still makes sense now.)</p>
<p>I am also aware that a powerful AI would also be aware of the scope of the problem, and would be so much better at integrating vari-scaled simulation to get the desired level of reliability that as long as we&#8217;re imagining powerful AI &#8211; which are fantastic enough &#8211; it is in my opinion not much more fantastic to imagine that they could cut out a lot of physical R&amp;D by doing so. </p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t have to model Infinite Fun Space. It just has to be a lot better at modeling, and scaling models up and down appropriately, than humans are. I find this a reasonable prospect.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;Simulations&#8221; aside, it&#8217;s obvious that the smarter you are, the more you learn from a set of experimental data. This is obviously true within human scales (the village idiot can&#8217;t be a scientist) and there&#8217;s no reason it wouldn&#8217;t extrapolate beyond human intelligence levels.</p>
<p>Yes there&#8217;s a limit, if you&#8217;re an ideal reasoner each independent bit of information will halve your uncertainty on average (handwaving for brevity), but humans are nowhere close to that.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>and on the engineering side &#8211; certainly, humans require lots of trials to build a working car or whatever. But, I think with the vast majority of issues, you get the relevant designer slapping himself over the head and thinking &#8220;we were idiots to forget to account for heat flow down that piece of pipe&#8221; or &#8220;if only I&#8217;d studied the chemistry of those gases I would have realized that that surface would corrode&#8221; or whatever. The vast majority of issues are anticipatable *in principle* and would be anticipated by a sufficiently smart designer.</p>
<p>Coming at it from a different angle, the argument that smarter =&gt; fewer errors clearly holds within human intelligence range (there aren&#8217;t many dumb successful engineers) so you&#8217;d expect that superhuman intelligences would have even fewer errors and perhaps none at all.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s reasonable, for even a substantially superhuman AI in a box with neither knowledge, inputs, nor outputs, to do very well if dropped into the African savannah on a world without any technology. Particularly if that box is made out of material that lions would find tasty.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not what would be happening. A hypothetical unfriendly AI would be able to piggyback on a lot of our development. I think something being smart enough to take over the world from scratch is really, really hard. Being able to usurp a world we&#8217;ve already spent millennia taking over is probably much easier.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You say that one &#8220;can certainly use an AI like the ones in chess-playing computers, but nobody’s very scared of the AIs in chess-playing computers either&#8221;. Isn&#8217;t this in part because chess isn&#8217;t very scary? It seems reasonable that a specialized AI could be good enough to be dangerous in an arena like tactics, infrastructure disruption, or persuasion without having the generalism necessary to be able to do anything on its own. The issue isn&#8217;t an AI as an agent, but rather AI as weapons for human agents. Whether or not it&#8217;s powerful enough to beat the US government doesn&#8217;t change the fact that such a thing could still do a whole lot of damage.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I am not sure why OpenAI poses any additional risk over what we&#8217;re already facing:<br />
 + I&#8217;ve been able to download several different open source AI implementations for years.<br />
 + I know of two different very skilled researchers building terrifying things in their basements.<br />
 + It is an assumption of academic AI research that major findings will be published, and can thus be duplicated.<br />
 + There are more huge companies than I can count working on this problem in parallel, with only perhaps one of them (Google) even thinking in terms of the Control Problem.</p>
<p>What is OpenAI really doing, other than perhaps funding a bit more research than would otherwise be funded? Their commitment to open-sourcing things really doesn&#8217;t change the overall rate of dangerous-results-being-made-public. In other words, we&#8217;ve had &#8220;Open AI&#8221; for years already, the only novelty that &#8220;OpenAI&#8221; brings to the table is a bizarre justification for why the status quo is a good thing.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The idea is that, if it is possible to create human-level AI, it won&#8217;t be that much harder to make a superintelligent AI. Either it&#8217;s reasonably possible to solve the coordination problem of creating a friendly superintelligence or it&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>If it is possible, it would be the best thing that could ever happen to the human race. It would be a literal government by angels that could solve every human problem and be the Unincentivized Incentivizer.</p>
<p>If it is not possible to solve this coordination problem, i.e. if an unfriendly AI will be created no matter what feasible steps we take, we&#8217;re screwed even we try to coordinate on human-level.</p>

<p>And this is where I start banging my head off the desk.  This is pure <em>religion</em> (I should recognise it, I&#8217;m Catholic) and you will still have the problem of how do you make people be good?</p>
<p>Suppose your AI World Dictator decides, based on trawling through all the social science research, psychology, evolutionary science, etc. etc. etc. that every human will be happiest when married so tomorrow, Vox Imperatoris, you report to the registry office to meet your bride (oh, and it&#8217;s all opposite-sex marriage as well, sorry gay rights activists!).</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t want to get married?  Or you want to choose your own marriage partner?  Or you&#8217;re not heterosexual?  Well, your Overlord knows what is best and just behave yourself and fall in with the plan!</p>
<p>And if you <em>really</em> don&#8217;t feel you can do it, no worries: a simple brain tweak will mean your new, improved self will love the idea and live blissfully with your new spouse!</p>

<p>The reason I support political freedom and the right to choice is that I don&#8217;t think the government actually knows better than me, and it is necessary for me to rely on my own free use of reason.</p>
<p>James Madison is where I got the line from about a &#8220;government by angels&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>But by hypothesis, the AI actually does know better than me, so I should do what it says. It should be able to force me to do what it says even if I don&#8217;t want to because this would, by hypothesis, be in my own best interest. If the hypothesis is not true, if the AI does not know my best interest, it is not Friendly. That&#8217;s why having an Unfriendly AI would be Very Bad.</p>
<p>As for metaphysical free will, just having no political freedom would not get rid of that. People in Gulags have metaphysical free will. But free will is not a &#8220;good thing&#8221;. It is just how people are. It&#8217;s not valuable in and of itself. Now, it&#8217;s much better to have free will than to be deterministically rigged up to make poor choices and be miserable. However, it would be much better than having free will to be deterministically rigged up to make perfect choices all the time.</p>
<p>This is the exact <i>modus tollens</i> argument that God does not exist (AKA the problem of evil). If God existed, he would send angels down to rule over humanity and get rid of all the communists and socialists and progressives and fascists and bigots in government. If He even thought it desirable that people be allowed to sin—and I have no idea why He would—He would institute a perfectly effective police force, staffed by angels, to stop anyone from violating the rights of others. Bullets would just bounce off the innocent. At the very least, every reasonable person would find it obvious that One Church was the True Church, and it would be simple to persuade people of this.</p>
<p>We observe that none of this is the case. This casts doubt on the prospect that God exists.</p>
<p>The Christian reversal of this is to rationalize every evil thing in the world as being actually good in some amazing way—because after all, this <i>must</i> be the best of all possible worlds.</p>
<p>This includes Hitler. Somehow the idea is that Hitler&#8217;s having &#8220;free will&#8221; (ignoring, by the way, the distinction between metaphysical and political freedom) is so good that it outweighs any evil that comes of it. I find that implausible.</p>

<p>The Christian idea is not that this is the best of all possible worlds, but that this is a fallen and broken world that has to be healed.</p>
<p>And yes, free will is so vitally important that even God will let Himself be bound by our choices.  I have no idea why.  It would certainly be a lot simpler if we were all flesh robots, but then again, a lot of freethinkers seem to dislike the idea of an all-controlling god and rhapsodise about the ability to fall, to fail, to get up again and learn from our mistakes and march onwards, ever onwards and upwards.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Christianity completely cannot explain—and the free will argument does nothing to help—why there is &#8220;natural evil&#8221;, i.e. bad stuff, in the world. The usual attempts to explain this, which have been common regardless of whether you agree with them, are on the very low order of: &#8220;Well, a lawful universe is good. So if that means a volcano rains down lava on innocent Italian children, yeah that&#8217;s undesirable but any other alternative would be worse.&#8221; Hence best possible world. God does the best he can, but he&#8217;s got a dirty job.</p>
<p>And even if you say this is <i>not</i> the best possible world—that it is a &#8220;fallen and broken world&#8221;, though I think you come close to semi-Gnostic heresy there—the question is: did God make a fallen world for a good purpose or an evil purpose? If it was for a good purpose, then this <i>is</i> the best of all possible worlds after all. After all, it would be somewhat evil to make it for a worse purpose than the best purpose.</p>
<blockquote><p>And yes, free will is so vitally important that even God will let Himself be bound by our choices. I have no idea why.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, the appeal to mystery is of course the end of rational discussion.</p>
<p>Moreover, many Christian denominations explicitly (and nearly all the rest of them implicitly) deny free will. They believe in determinism: determinism by God and not physics, but nevertheless determinism.</p>
<p>And this is not limited to Luther and Calvin, and Jansenists like Blaise Pascal.</p>
<p>Augustine was—at best—a compatibilist, as was Thomas Aquinas. That is, of course, the view that everything people do is completely determined and they could never act differently than they do—while playing with definitions to call this &#8220;free will&#8221;. As Augustine said:</p>
<blockquote><p>[N]ot only men’s good wills, which God Himself converts from bad ones, and, when converted by Him, directs to good action and to eternal life, but also those which follow the world are <b>so entirely at the disposal of God, that He turns them wherever He wills, and whenever He wills,</b>&#8211;to bestow kindness on some, and to heap punishment on others. . . . <b>God works in the hearts of men to incline their wills wherever He wills, whether to good deeds according to His mercy, or to evil after their own deserts</b>. . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, the doctrine of Original Sin is obviously incompatible with free will. And the only pre-Enlightenment Christian school to defend free will—the Pelagians—were condemned as heretical precisely because of this conflict.</p>
<p>And even if you are a Pelagian and don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s incompatible with Original Sin—<a href="https://objectivismforintellectuals.wordpress.com/2015/08/15/one-internal-contradiction-in-the-christian-worldview-gods-omniscience-vs-free-will/" rel="nofollow">free will is incompatible with God&#8217;s omniscience</a>, anyway. So free will is in conflict with Christianity at every level.</p>
<p>Now some Christian thinkers, such as Peter John Olivi—a medieval scholastic with a very good and very ahead-of-his-time theory of free will—believe in the libertarian view of free will: the view that in respect of the same action at the same time, man can both act or refrain from acting. But, by and large, they just ignore the conflicts this has with Christian doctrine because there is no solution.</p>
<blockquote><p>It would certainly be a lot simpler if we were all flesh robots, but then again, a lot of freethinkers seem to dislike the idea of an all-controlling god and rhapsodise about the ability to fall, to fail, to get up again and learn from our mistakes and march onwards, ever onwards and upwards.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, given that the nature of man is such that he <i>does</i> have free will, the belief in an all-controlling God whose existence is incompatible with free will might very well be seen as contrary to facts and productive of harmful consequences.</p>

<p>I agree with you that given this assumption, you should do what the AI says. I think the point of dispute, at least from my view, is that I don&#8217;t see why you should expect the AI to really know better than you what you want.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I have often had the experience of wanting things that, upon reflection, are not good for me. The AI would not know what I <i>want</i> better than me. It would know what is <i>good for me</i> better than me.</p>
<p>If (as I say it is) what is best for me is what makes me happiest—not physical pleasure but all-round <i>eudaimonia</i>—the AI will be in a much better position to judge than I myself will. I find it hard to understand how &#8220;What if the AI makes me as happy as I can be, but I&#8217;m not&#8230;you know&#8230;<i>really</i> happy?&#8221; is a coherent objection. Unless it is merely pointing out the obvious threat of the AI taking some limited feature of happiness like pleasure and promoting only that—the very definition of Unfriendly AI.</p>
<p>Now you can argue that this (Friendly AI) is impossible, but that&#8217;s another question.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not my objection. I&#8217;m not disagreeing with the concept of someone smarter than you being able to know what you want better than you. I&#8217;m saying that building an AI such that it is actually like this seems extraordinarily difficult, part of which is because determining whether your AI, which is (as in Deiseach&#8217;s hypothetical) telling everyone they must get married to a person of the opposite sex immediately, is actually acting in your best interest or not, seems close to impossible. It&#8217;s easy to see that an AI which wants everyone to die is not acting in everyone&#8217;s best interest; not so much for goals that some people actually do approve of and others don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re somewhat libertarian inclined, from what I&#8217;ve seen &#8211; surely you understand that part of the argument for that is that knowing what everyone wants, and knowing that what someone says everyone wants really is what everyone wants, is a very very hard problem, right?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t deny that it might be impossible to build a Friendly AI superintelligence that could actually determine what is best for people in the way <b>Deiseach</b> describes.</p>
<p>But then we should be <i>really</i> worried if we still believe AI superintelligence in general is possible. (If we don&#8217;t, that&#8217;s a separate question.) Because if it&#8217;s possible and not really easy to coordinate against, it will eventually be built. And if you&#8217;re right, it will certainly be Unfriendly because it can&#8217;t be Friendly.</p>
<p>I am not, in general, an optimist about AI who thinks it will save as all in the manner I described. But if it <i>could</i> it would be great. If it can&#8217;t, too bad, because someone is going to do it anyway if it can be done.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s necessary for an AI to autonomously work to maximize the happiness of everyone in the world in order for it to be friendly (or &#8216;aligned&#8217; as the MIRI folk now seem to be calling it). An AI that understood instructions given to it reasonably well, and more importantly, understood the &#8220;do not prevent the person controlling you from issuing commands to you&#8221; directive and the &#8220;stop what you&#8217;re doing immediately&#8221; command, seems like it would be reasonably safe. Yes, of course there are a ton of ways that you could screw up in getting it to do those things, which is where the safety work comes in. But creating an AI like this would not require a knowledge of everyone in the world&#8217;s preferences, which seems to me like a far more difficult task than the safety concerns &#8211; perhaps an unsolvable task.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re exactly right.</p>
<p>I was just playing along with <b>Deiseach</b>&#8216;s hypothetical and arguing that <i>if</i> it could do this, it would be good, not bad.</p>
<p>But clearly, if you can convincingly argue that it is impossible to dictatorially plan everyone&#8217;s life like that, a Friendly superintelligence would be able to come to the same conclusion and would not try to plan society like that.

<p>I do think it is clear that Friendly superintelligence = &#8220;government of angels&#8221;.

<p>This does not follow.</p>
<p>The reason for the directive when it is &#8220;humans &#8211; AI&#8221; is to prevent the AI from harming humans. We don&#8217;t need to prevent humans from harming the AI. The AI exists only to serve.</p>
<p>It must not be confused with the idea of a God whom humanity exists to serve. But this &#8220;god&#8221; exists to serve humanity.</p>
<p>Now perhaps humans could harm themselves by not listening to it, given that it knows best. In that sense, they probably should do whatever it says. But it does not follow that it would necessarily tell them exactly what to do in every situation.</p>

<blockquote><p>But clearly, if you can convincingly argue that it is impossible to dictatorially plan everyone’s life like that, a Friendly superintelligence would be able to come to the same conclusion and would not try to plan society like that.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s more than that. First of all you need it to really think like a human, understand human concepts. Then, even if it was just going to be your personal slave, you need it to understand what you want, what you really want &#8211; something you don&#8217;t even know yourself. If you want it to be not your personal slave but a god for the world, you need it to understand what everyone wants, AND how to balance everyone&#8217;s differing preferences. There&#8217;s the problem of getting that information. There&#8217;s the problem of knowing what information to program it to get.</p>
<p>But I think the biggest problem is knowing when you&#8217;ve actually programmed it to do the right thing and when you haven&#8217;t. You create an AI and write its utility function to do what you think is maximizing human happiness, in the sense you believe is correct. It comes back and orders lots and lots of people to do things they don&#8217;t want to do. How do you know whether you&#8217;re wrong or whether the AI is wrong? How <i>can</i> you know?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I read about it, but my understanding of Yudkowsky&#8217;s CEV idea relies on human preferences converging on a single ideal. I think that&#8217;s&#8230; implausible, to put it nicely. If it turns out it&#8217;s actually correct, and if we have a way of knowing it is, then I will consider the AI god idea a plausible approach, but it seems to me that it almost certainly isn&#8217;t correct, that people&#8217;s preferences really are totally different and wild and at odds with one another, if only because people care much more about themselves than they do about everyone else.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s two objections here:</p>
<p>a) Friendly AI is impossible.</p>
<p>b) Even if it were possible, it would be bad because it would take away our free will to determine our own destiny.</p>
<p>I was mainly responding to the second.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s been a while since I read about it, but my understanding of Yudkowsky’s CEV idea relies on human preferences converging on a single ideal.

<p>I don&#8217;t regard it as so implausible—but on the other hand I think it would likely take the form of something more-or-less resembling wireheading, in Scott&#8217;s &#8220;lotus gods&#8221; sense. If you really understood what produces the emotion of happiness, you could stimulate that directly for each person—and give him a whole universe to contemplate at the same time.</p>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t think it is anything like that, and if you think people&#8217;s goals conflict to some extent, there is the possibility for compromise. The AI could ensure that average satisfaction for all humans it serves was maximized, and everyone would agree to this rather than fight or be excluded.</p>
<p>Besides, say everyone cares solely about himself as a terminal value. What&#8217;s the problem? There&#8217;s only a certain amount of happy you can <i>be</i>. Setting aside the Bostromian silliness of turning the entire universe into computronium to check &#8220;are you sure you&#8217;re sure you&#8217;re sure you&#8217;re as happy as can be?&#8221;, each person needs only a certain amount. So it&#8217;s not even that we have to have a compromise. There is no conflict. And clearly it would all be in their interest to work together on this; there would be no incentive to have the thing kill everyone else so that only oneself could be happy unless one positively <i>disvalued</i> others.</p>
<p>Anyway, all this is beside the main point I wanted to make initially. Even if the Friendly AI is much more limited, even if it can do nothing like make everyone as happy as possible, there is still an enormous amount it <i>can</i> do. There are plenty of things in the world that <i>nobody</i> really likes but happen anyway because of coordination problems.</p>
<p>The AI solves the problem of &#8220;who watches the watchers?&#8221;. It is the watcher that doesn&#8217;t need to be watched. It is the Unincentivized Incentivizer. This was the main point of &#8220;Meditations on Moloch&#8221;: many problems in the world are not about value conflicts. They are problems of incentives and inability to coordinate.</p>
<p>The AI is not vulnerable to corruption. It has only the best interests of the people at heart. It could therefore have the power of a dictator to break through deadlock and partisanism—but without having to be kept from exploiting that power. And it can safeguard the rights of all from criminals and tyrants. Unlike even the best of humans, it will evaluate political systems in an unbiased way and do at least as well as any human government could at legislating for the common good.</p>
<p>Maybe it won&#8217;t be perfect, but it will be a lot more perfect than any human government, with all the known &#8220;government failures&#8221; identified by public choice economics.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>The AI could ensure that average satisfaction for all humans it serves was maximized</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the problems I mentioned is determining what &#8216;average satisfaction&#8217; means, and how you quantify it. Wireheading does indeed seem like one approach, but I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s one many people would like. Another problem is how you verify you&#8217;ve got your definition of average satisfaction correct: you can&#8217;t verify it by asking people what they want, because everyone will say it doesn&#8217;t give them as much as it should even if it does, and you can&#8217;t even verify it for just one person by asking whether it gives them what they want, because part of the point is giving them what they &#8216;really&#8217; want, even if they don&#8217;t think they want it.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think this is conceptually unsolvable. I think there is something that you could call &#8216;what everyone really wants&#8217;. I just think that determining what it is is so unimaginably difficult as to make trying to do so a fruitless task, especially since you only get one shot, after which time your &#8216;humanity utility function&#8217; is encoded in the fabric of the universe forever.</p>
<p>EDIT: on reflection, I&#8217;m not actually convinced this &#8211; i.e. solving moral philosophy &#8211; is conceptually possible at all.</p>
<p>Oh, and regarding this:</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s only a certain amount of happy you can be.</p></blockquote>
<p>If that were true then AI wouldn&#8217;t be dangerous in the first place.</p>
<p>Regarding coordination problems, I don&#8217;t think they are as big a deal as you or Scott make out. I especially reject the claim (by Scott) that technology makes them more of a problem. I think that&#8217;s a total mistake. Better technology <i>solves</i> coordination problems. With fixed harm type externalities, like Scott&#8217;s libertarian lake, it lets you quantify the effect each person has on each other &#8211; so in this example, it lets you count exactly how many fish there are in the lake, quantify the harm that pollution does to them, so you can give each fisherman a percentage of the fish stock and then bill the polluters for the damage they do. With problems like everyone speaking different languages, better technology can allow for better interfaces between people, so can allow greater variety to coexist with interoperability &#8211; everyone speaks their own language, a computer hears their words and translates them so the person on the other end can understand them.</p>
<p>With other types of coordination problems, like arms races, I think they are not necessarily made better by technology but not necessarily made worse either. To add to what I&#8217;ve said elsewhere in the thread, new technology might make an arms race worse, if it creates a situation where spending more on weapons gets you a big advantage, but it might make an arms race better, if it&#8217;s a technology that provides big gains in power but which the version of that it is not worth increasing beyond is relatively affordable.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think the chance of solving coordination problems is worth what seems to me like the almost certainty that a god AI would turn out to maximize something it shouldn&#8217;t, and continue to do so for all eternity.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t see why it could not, in principle, discover how what we call &#8220;happiness&#8221; is produced and do whatever is necessary to produce it. As for the averaging, since it understands happiness, it will know how much is produced—in some rough way, at least.</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t think this is conceptually unsolvable. I think there is something that you could call ‘what everyone really wants’.

<p>Assuming the thing could determine how happiness is produced, I guess the question would be: is happiness what people really want? The essential idea is: the AI is really smart, and it can determine based on the logic a person normally uses what he <i>would think</i> if he were that smart.</p>
<p>Like, &#8220;Do I <i>really</i> value golf as an end in itself? Or is it a means to happiness?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, if people have more than one terminal value upon reflection at this highest level, we have a problem. It is impossible in principle to trade off multiple terminal values, which is the problem with the theories that allege we have or ought to have multiple terminal values. If there were a standard by which to trade them off, that would be your real terminal value.</p>
<p>Frankly though, would it <i>really</i> be so bad for the thing to just reprogram people to actually value happiness as a terminal value? Or give them a choice between that and some reasonable allowance to do whatever they wanted with their incoherent values.</p>
<blockquote><p>EDIT: on reflection, I’m not actually convinced this – i.e. solving moral philosophy – is conceptually possible at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you don&#8217;t believe in moral realism, the whole question in meaningless. But then so are much simpler questions like whether you should rob people.</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s only a certain amount of happy you can be.</p>
<p>If that were true then AI wouldn’t be dangerous in the first place.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe so. but people can at least sign agree that it&#8217;s better to have a guaranteed chance of slightly sub-optimal bliss than an infinitesimal chance of being the guy who gets optimal bliss by killing everyone else. And the Unincentivized Incentivizer can enforce this agreement.</p>
<p>As to your analysis of coordination problems&#8230;I don&#8217;t know how anyone who lives under the incompetent, irrational, immoral buffoonery of the United States government—or any government—can say such a thing. Nor especially how you can say it when we live under the very real threat of nuclear annihilation, just waiting for the first tension between Russia and America to result in some accident. Or face the future prospect of annihilation by rogue nanotechnology, superviruses, or backyard antimatter bombs.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t want to get into that.</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t think the chance of solving coordination problems is worth what seems to me like the almost certainty that a god AI would turn out to maximize something it shouldn’t, and continue to do so for all eternity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, the most obvious coordination problem a Friendly superintelligence solves is preventing Unfriendly superintelligence. Even if Friendly superintelligence is likely not to work (and this is my opinion, to be honest)—supposing superintelligence to be possible and not incredibly easy to coordinate against—we don&#8217;t get to decide between that and no superintelligence at all.</p>

<p>I agree that the AI could, in principle, work out what happiness is, and determine from there what makes us happy. But we don&#8217;t know what our terminal values are &#8211; don&#8217;t know if happiness really is what we want to maximize, or if it also includes personal satisfaction, or achievement, or love, or anything else. And I think that we not only don&#8217;t know but can&#8217;t know, because the whole point of knowing better than us is that the AI is going to tell us that we want things that we strongly disagree with. You need a way of determining the difference between something you want but don&#8217;t know you want, and something you don&#8217;t want. I don&#8217;t think there is such a way. &#8216;Just let us try it for a while&#8217; does not seem to work, as it works as well for heroin and wireheading as it does for something we do really want.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to cheat and say, well, just let the AI reprogram us to value happiness, then why not skip determining what happiness is and just have it reprogram us to value paperclips? Or &#8211; conclude, as you arguably could, that the AI getting utility out of creating paperclips is no less valid a form of utility than humans getting value out of whatever it is we value. So, the friendliness problem is not a problem at all &#8211; the AI is a utility monster and everyone else can shut up and hand over their atoms.</p>
<p>Regarding coordination problems, I agree that governments are rife with them. Nuclear annihilation seems unlikely, though, and in any case, there are very few players in the game of nuclear deterrence, which makes it more dangerous. Also, nukes are very indiscriminate weapons &#8211; a nanobot swarm would be much tidier and less likely to hurt bystanders.</p>
<blockquote><p>Even if Friendly superintelligence is likely not to work (and this is my opinion, to be honest)—supposing superintelligence to be possible and not incredibly easy to coordinate against—we don’t get to decide between that and no superintelligence at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, but I think we might get to decide between that and many superintelligences under human control.</p>

<p>Well, okay, you&#8217;re right. If you really didn&#8217;t value happiness, that wouldn&#8217;t be any more desirable than just letting it make paperclips. I was working off the assumption that people do already value happiness at least a little bit.</p>
<p>I think the strongest argument for something like coherent extrapolated volition is: if you found out that you really did have multiple terminal values, wouldn&#8217;t you <i>want</i> to self-modify to make them into one coherent value? So that you would have some rational way of pursuing and prioritizing your values?</p>

<p>It models your thought processes and comes to the same conclusions you would come to if you had all that intelligence.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the exact problem. There, is principle, no way to tell you&#8217;ve gotten it right once you&#8217;ve built the thing.</p>
<p>You just have to sit down and think about in your armchair really hard, design it, and hope it works. Which is why it is very dangerous and unlikely to work.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;Human-level&#8221; is a phrase that gets used a lot, but it is almost meaningless. There&#8217;s no reason to assume that any given AI will have anything like the architecture of a human brain.</p>
<p>We already have dozens of examples of AI that outperform humans at narrow tasks. If &#8220;human level&#8221; means &#8220;passes the Turing test&#8221;, well, a super-human AI could pass the Turing test, and the human tester probably wouldn&#8217;t know it was talking to a superintelligence unless the superintelligence was showing off.</p>
<p>Even if &#8220;human level&#8221; means &#8220;scores 100 on an IQ test&#8221;, I&#8217;m not convinced that this would prove anything, because, again, any given AI would have strengths and weaknesses far different from those of a human.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The concern is that, if a human is smart enough to build an AI, then a Human-Level-AI can learn how it was built, and build another of itself, but a little bit smarter. The new AI can create children of it&#8217;s own (this is a bit of a toy model, there&#8217;s no real difference between improving yourself and having children when your an abstraction of computing results) but it can figure out how to make them a little smarter than that. And then the cooperation doesn&#8217;t matter because there&#8217;s no real human involvement in the refinement process.<br />
You need to assume that the gradient of diminishing returns isn&#8217;t particularly steep past human level intelligence for this concern to be reasonable, but since we don&#8217;t have any good ideas about where the IQ of 100 sits on the scale to begin with (outside of &#8220;probably in the middle somewhere) that&#8217;s not a slam-dunk rebuttal.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p><i>if a human is smart enough to build an AI&#8230;</i></p>
<p>Fortunately, that is extremely unlikely to be the case.  You are I think working from the ideal, emotionally appealing and beloved of fiction and popular-science writers, of the Lone Genius Inventor.  And there are rare cases that sort of approximate that ideal, but after fifty years of AI researchers with access to exponentially-increasing quantities of computronium, this almost certainly isn&#8217;t one of them.</p>
<p>Recalibrate that argument to the more accurate, &#8220;If a community of thousands of very smart humans, using an infrastructure built and maintained by millions of very smart humans, is collaboratively smart enough to build an AI&#8230;&#8221;, and figure how things go from there.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You can make that argument, and it&#8217;s a small component of why <b>I&#8217;m</b> not particularly worried about FAI, but now we&#8217;re fighting the hypothetical. The concern of people worried about Open AI is that, <i> conditional on a solitaire human-tractable intelligence being able to productively create/edit GAI once it has already been done once</i> leaving the instructions lying around is really dangerous.<br />
Basically: I could never invent the internal combustion engine. But since they already exist and I&#8217;ve worked in about 100 of them, it wouldn&#8217;t be impossible for me to make one more example of an internal combustion engine.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Can you single-handedly design and build an internal combustion engine that is a substantial improvement over the state of the art?</p>
<p>If the question is merely one of whether black hats will be able to get hold of unfriendly AIs to serve their nefarious scheme, then yeah, all it takes is for human intellect to suffice for modifying or replicating proven designs.  As with any other weapon, I think you have to assume that at least some unfriendly humans will have access to the best AIs around.</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re asserting a hard-takeoff scenario, or even a stealthy-takeoff, then you need the posited emergent human-level AI to be able to build not just another human-level AI, but a weakly superhuman AI.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p><em>Windows and Google Search are both fantastically complex products of millions of man-hours of research; Windows comes bundled with your computer and Google is free. </em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m effin&#8217; sure Google isn&#8217;t really &#8220;for free&#8221; given the annoying amount of &#8220;Ads by Google&#8221; that keep popping up when I&#8217;m watching YouTube, never mind the constant shilling to join Google+ and hand over every scrap of details about my various devices, accounts, interests, friends&#8217; lists, etc.</p>
<p>And Windows as the OS bundled with your PC package isn&#8217;t really &#8220;for free&#8221; either; the cost is factored into the price charged (and as pointed out above, also paid for by all the bloatware and crap you then have to physically delete from your machine once you have it up and running &#8211; no, I do <em>not</em> want McAfee but Dell keep insisting on giving it to me).  Plus, Microsoft are moving now from &#8220;buy Office suite in one of the ninety-nine slightly different versions on offer but own it for ever&#8221; to &#8220;pay a yearly subscription for the latest version which in effect means you can&#8217;t get a physical media version of the software and you have to keep paying to use this for eternity instead of a one-time purchase&#8221;.</p>
<p>So &#8220;free&#8221; has <em>slightly</em> different meaning in this case 🙂</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Are not pirates merely economic competition for software distributors? It works like:</p>
<p>1. Pirate acquires a copy somehow, probably paying for it, because breaking into Microsoft labs to steal a DVD/pendrive is ridiculously dangerous and inconvenient compared to just buying something in the local computer store or online.<br />
2. Pirate alters the copy to remove limitations precluding unauthorized use and potentially improving the program in other ways (removing bloatware, tracking apps, etc), at own expense.<br />
3. Pirate offers the altered product on the Internet for free, at own expense.<br />
4. Users download an improved product at a better price than the original.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The odds of a human having something resembling human moral values are pretty high.  The odds of an AI having them is much lower.   The ability to develop human values is already encoded in our genes, it takes serious disruption to prevent them from developing. AIs have to have it all programmed in from scratch.</p>
<p>Most selectively bred humans will have a moral conscience.  The odds of a superintelligent AI having one is a lot lower.  And even if we try to program it with one, the odds of screwing up are a lot worse.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think you may be putting too much stock in the name.

<p>Projects that can, for example (and this is an example that OpenAI page uses), <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-09/01/art-algorithm-recreates-paintings" rel="nofollow">extract stylistically relevant features</a> of sets of images and apply those features to other images may be referred to as &#8220;AI&#8221;, but I don&#8217;t think those sorts  projects are likely to spontaneously produce (or produce breakthroughs that suddenly lead to) any sort of intelligence explosion.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It seems to me that you&#8217;ve bought a lot of stock fallacies there.</p>
<p>First, there&#8217;s no reason to think that closed source keeps things out of the hands of bad/careless actors&#8230; or indeed that even the most extreme security measures you could possibly apply would work even in any part of the easy-construction, hard-takeoff possibility space, let alone in any of the other parts of the space.</p>
<p>Amoral guys are not only faster than good guys in doing development. They&#8217;re also better than good guys at stealing things, and may be better than good guys at holding onto relative advantages by not sharing their own work. </p>
<p>If you could build atomic bombs out of Model T parts, it would have happened by now. If it had been kept secret in 1925, it would still have happened by 1935. And if you can build some kind of godlike AI out of your GPU, it will happen soon enough no matter how much anybody tries to keep the recipe under wraps. A lot faster than anybody will figure out how to control it. If that&#8217;s your scenario, you simply lose regardless of what you do.</p>
<p>You haven&#8217;t done the work to show that open source is significantly damaging, or indeed that (attempted) secrecy or lack thereof makes any significant difference in either direction, under ANY set of circumstances. But you talk as if that were a given.</p>
<p>Second, OpenAI isn&#8217;t working on anything remotely close to superintelligences, and their stated plans to keep working on machine learning mean that they&#8217;re not going to get anywhere near superintelligence any time soon. So who cares what their attitude is? What they&#8217;re &#8220;opening&#8221; isn&#8217;t what you&#8217;re worried about, EVEN IF THEY THINK IT IS.</p>
<p>Third, I would, in fact, rather be turned into paperclips than ruled by Dr. Evil. And for that matter I often think that Yudkowsky&#8217;s &#8220;coherent extrapolated volition&#8221; might be a lot more like Dr. Evil than people might like to admit, if you gave it nearly unlimited power.</p>
<p>Fourth, although I don&#8217;t know if it actually affects the threat analysis much, you&#8217;re thinking about superintelligence as some kind of magic wand. You see this all over the place among people in the &#8220;Yudkowskian&#8221; tradition. The most obvious version is the common blithe assumption (which you did not use here) that it&#8217;s physically possible to run as many simulations as you want with as much detail as you want. There are similar assumptions buried in the general failure to consider any bounds on power at all. I see you&#8217;ve been waving Moore&#8217;s law around&#8230; even though Moore&#8217;s law is obviously NOT a physical law, WILL eventually fail, and probably isn&#8217;t being kept up with in its strong form RIGHT NOW.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think your concerns are entirely right, but don&#8217;t apply to all hard takeoffs, just a hard takeoff that is also soon, before the work has been done to ensure AI is safe. An open source AI in a world where AI safety is understood well works just as Musk describes it &#8211; prevents one AI from dominating the world. Multiple safe AIs can ride the hard takeoff wave together &#8211; perhaps some or even all of them being multiple instances of the same AI.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re Bostrom or Yudkowsky or you, you might think that&#8217;s a bad thing &#8211; we don&#8217;t get an AI god to solve all our coordination problems for us. On the other hand, if you think, as I think someone might reasonably think, that creating a safe AI that works alone to make the world as good as possible according to what everyone wants is a problem several orders of magnitude harder than just creating a safe AI that humans are able to control, and that technology makes coordination problems easier to solve, not harder, then a large number of the latter kind of AI existing will allow humans to maximize their own interest themselves, in the old fashioned way: bargaining.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p><i>Then consider that an AI powerful enough to be dangerous can copy anything another AI does in milliseconds, and deploy novel weaponry, of whatever type, in the same sort of timeframe</i></p>
<p>Explain, please.  The last time I had to download anything resembling a nuclear-weapons design hydrocode on my admittedly not-I desktop computer, it took minutes rather than milliseconds.  And not single-digit minutes, if I recall.  How is it that adding &#8220;AI&#8221; makes this process six orders of magnitude faster?  No matter how intelligent you make the computer, there&#8217;s a bottleneck in the data rate of the DSL line.  Unless maybe you think current DSL protocols and compression algorithms only achieve 0.0001% of theoretical efficiency and a proper AI will deploy the optimal version in nothing flat.</p>
<p>And then, allegedly, the AI can build <i>actual nuclear weapons</i>, in <i>milliseconds</i>?  Again, an explanation is in order.  There&#8217;s a 3-D printer just down the hall, but it again takes minutes, not milliseconds, and I&#8217;m pretty sure it can&#8217;t print plutonium or lithium deuteride at any speed.</p>
<p>Maybe after you&#8217;ve arranged for the AI to take over the world and rebuild all of its information and manufacturing infrastructure to AI standards, we could get some of these timescales down to seconds.  If we ignore the obvious catch-22 in that we need the AI superweapons to conquer the world in the first place.  But if you say &#8216;milliseconds&#8217;, then I say you are a cultist worshiping at the altar of AI omniscience rather than a rationalist attempting to determine the capabilities of a plausible AI.</p>

<p>True, but I&#8217;m not sure what the significance of your point is &#8211; the arms race still ends when getting a bigger gun, or more nukes, no longer nets you any extra benefit. All your argument suggests is that this point will be reached very quickly.</p>

<p>It depends on the nature of the arms, how many different agents there are with them, how many they have, and so on. Sometimes, spending more on getting more powerful weapons gets you an advantage that makes doing so worth it. Sometimes, it doesn&#8217;t. When the situation looks like the former kind, you need to be more worried, because whoever is most powerful can successively crush everyone else without suffering much loss. When the situation looks more like the latter kind, you don&#8217;t need to worry nearly as much, since anyone who tries to fight someone else, even if they win, will get badly hurt in the process.</p>
<p>Having more agents helps in both kinds of situation, but the latter allows for a greater difference in power while still having peace than the former, therefore meaning that the increase in power offered by acquiring a new weapon or technology must be greater before it is worth doing.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Probably not the clearest mixing of analogies, for which I apologize. My intended point was that human arms races are limited by human timescales. It&#8217;s completely true that AI can&#8217;t print nuclear weapons. </p>
<p>What the analogy was supposed to represent was AI e-warfare. Once there are a bunch of them, if they can interface electronically, they will conduct cyberwar on each other, absorbing the losers and copying successful techniques. Evolution writ very fast, very small, and then very large. Human &#8220;arms races&#8221; aren&#8217;t analogous &#8211; by bringing up nuclear weapons, I was trying to show why.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You vastly overrate intelligence and this poisons your perspective to the point that it becomes a twisted absurdity. Intelligence, which I&#8217;ll define for the moment as the manipulation of data in order to minimize the amount of physical manipulation one must perform to get a desired result, is a property that is severely limited in utility. I believe intelligence is *extremely* important, and improving it is clearly the most important thing we can do. However, it is not magic. It is not even close. </p>
<p>The HPMOR fanfic is a great example of intelligence-as-magic. Ender&#8217;s Game is a much less egregious, but still valid example. Both ascribe far too much power to intelligence. Intelligence allows you to do amazing things, but its power is sharply limited. Both stories conflate what intelligence can do with what <i>knowledge</i> can do. Intelligence is not knowledge. You can be arbitrarily intelligent, and it doesn&#8217;t do a damn thing for your prowess at a given task until you have had time to leverage it in the work of gathering data, which is necessarily a physical rather than abstract process and so sharply limited. </p>
<p>In addition, <i>prowess itself</i> is sharply limited. You can only be so good at a given task. We love to ascribe supernatural powers to &#8216;skill.&#8217; The fact is that skill itself is limited in usefulness &#8211; unlike in movies, a heroic fighter can be arbitrarily skilled and still have essentially no chance in most of the situations where an unskilled fighter would have no chance (a shell lands too close to you, your position is overrun by superior forces, etc). So these are some bounds on &#8216;intelligence.&#8217; It won&#8217;t make you arbitrarily good at anything, and it won&#8217;t even make you get to the hard (and low, compared to popular imagination) skill ceiling for any task arbitrarily fast. </p>
<p>It also can&#8217;t conjure resources out of thin air. Resources are very important. You can be arbitrarily intelligent *and* arbitrarily knowledgeable &#8211; tasks still have hard floors of resources required to accomplish them. The more impressive or extensive the task, the higher the floor. </p>
<p>So what does this all mean? It means that being the smartest being around has extremely limited implications. How limited? Let us look at examples. The Soviet Union had far, far less advanced computing capabilities, a far smaller high IQ population, and produced comparable &#8211; even superior in some cases &#8211; products in high technology sectors like rockets, submarines, aeroplanes, and of course nuclear bombs. The Cold War was the kind of conflict where computing power had the highest possible leverage, where both sides were sitting back and designing and building weapons at their leisure. </p>
<p>The famous saying is &#8216;slide rules took us to the moon.&#8217; Well, not quite, we needed computers for that task as well. But what we had was good enough. We have not surpassed the capability produced by those engineers, by that society, which had antediluvian computing capabilities compared to what we now wield. </p>
<p>If anything, these examples are unfair in that they *overstate* the importance of advancements in computing power and &#8216;intelligence&#8217; more broadly, because they are precisely the practical situations where they can be leveraged the most. This is the difference between popular imaginings of what data-manipulation capabilities allow you to do and cold reality. Those limitations I mentioned earlier are crushing when compared to airy imagination. Intelligence amounts to a reduction in the amount of legwork you need to do to accomplish a given task &#8211; but a <i>limited</i> reduction, and the result itself is limited. Your opponent can make up for less intelligence by doing more legwork, and not nearly as much more legwork as you might think. They can also more than make up for less intelligence by being bigger, applying more resources. </p>
<p>But that isn&#8217;t all because intelligence in and of itself requires resources, often a <i>lot</i> of resources. Intelligent people spend a lot of time and calories manipulating data. Often, they get nothing back from their investment. Sometimes that&#8217;s unimportant. Sometimes it&#8217;s your life. The problem is that the more important the circumstances, the more likely it is that delays are extremely costly in and of themselves. Often an opponent can force a situation where delays are extremely costly, and superior intelligence approaches zero value. </p>
<p>Intelligence pays great but limited dividends &#8211; I think it is clear that it is the most fruitful place to try to improve right now. I also think it is clear that it will not always be the best place to try to improve &#8211; well before we&#8217;re turning worlds into &#8216;computronium&#8217; we will have reached a point where more data manipulation ability is worth far, far less than it would cost in resources to produce.</p>

<p>If someone is running screaming at you with a hammer intelligence, even vast intelligence will do very little to save you. </p>
<p>But the more time you have to play with the more intelligence matters. Slide rules took us to the moon in exchange for a non-trivial fraction of the entire US GDP.

<p>Human societies went that long without much technology progress because they had to constantly move around gathering food and hunting things. Everywhere that agriculture was invented, it was followed great acceleration in technological development since people could now stay in one place and there was enough of a food surplus that a significant portion of the population could devote their life to things other than obtaining food. Intelligence mattered in that it enabled the development of agriculture, but the primary effect was that it allowed for more legwork.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>We’re only now getting to the point where private companies can get into space economically and a lot of the things driving that are based on intelligence and knowledge. </p></blockquote>
<p>Private companies are able to go to space (to LEO, not the moon!) &#8216;economically&#8217; largely because the government wants them to. Even if SpaceX would have survived without NASA contract money, it would not be doing very well. It&#8217;s a little silly to say &#8216;slide rules didn&#8217;t make it economic&#8217; (to go to the moon without government funding) when our fancy new computers have failed to change that. If anything, that&#8217;s a further strike in my argument&#8217;s favor! </p>
<p>It&#8217;s also interesting to note that the workhorse rocket of the US &#8216;private&#8217; space sector, ULA&#8217;s Atlas V, runs on a scaled down Soviet engine. Another testament to what can be accomplished with severely limited computing power by today&#8217;s standards.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>The HPMOR fanfic is a great example of intelligence-as-magic. Ender’s Game is a much less egregious, but still valid example. Both ascribe far too much power to intelligence. Intelligence allows you to do amazing things, but its power is sharply limited. Both stories conflate what intelligence can do with what <i>knowledge</i> can do. Intelligence is not knowledge. You can be arbitrarily intelligent, and it doesn’t do a damn thing for your prowess at a given task until you have had time to leverage it in the work of gathering data, which is necessarily a physical rather than abstract process and so sharply limited.</p></blockquote>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Which is nonsense. </p>
<p>Figuring out alien physics and biology based on a few seconds of webcam footage is absolutely idiotic and displays a complete lack of understanding about how science, or learning generally, works. You can&#8217;t pull knowledge from the aether that way unless you are actually a fictional character in poorly written sf yourself. </p>
<p>Also, while I&#8217;m perhaps the last person to throw stones here, it&#8217;s very impolite to just drop context-free links this way. This is an argument which can be summarized in a single sentence while losing nothing of the original.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m not sure what about that is supposed to strike me as nonsense. </p>
<p>Paleontologists can identify a species from a piece of bone so small and weathered that I would mistake it for a rock.</p>
<p>Humans with nothing but (practically) two-dimensional images of a (practically) unchanging sky have theorized and then proved various increasingly complex theories about the nature of the universe, its origin and its fate.</p>
<p>The experiments which are regarded as the critical ones proving the quantum nature of photons, and the quantization of charge in electrons, would be meaningless to a layman. But intelligent people drew out the correct conclusion.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>People staring at 2-D images of the practically-unchanging sky provided various increasingly complex and <i>completely wrong</i> theories about where the sun gets the energy to shine, theories that with great intellectual rigor tended to support young-Earth creationism, until they managed to do laboratory experiments in nuclear physics.</p>
<p>And yes, it needed expert intellects to tease out quantum theory from experiments on photons and electrons, but it also needed the experiments.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yes, agreed:<br />
To accomplish anything, one needs<br />
intelligence, and data (and often experiments), and physical resources, and physical prowess<br />
to manipulate those resources.<br />
To some degree (as you&#8217;ve said), some of these inputs can substitute for each other.<br />
To my mind, a large unknown is how much of these inputs have been put online, and are<br />
effectively available to an optimizer with sufficient intelligence.<br />
For instance, a large fraction (most?) of the scientific literature is online.<br />
That makes many potential physical experiments redundant.<br />
Then again, many, many reports in the scientific literature are either wrong, or<br />
have gaps &#8211; even at the level of trivial things like: &#8220;You made a new compound and<br />
reported its structure and spectrum &#8211; what does it dissolve in?&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>If you could build atomic bombs out of Model T parts, it would have happened by now. If it had been kept secret in 1925, it would still have happened by 1935.</p></blockquote>
<p>Consider Christopher Columbus.  His voyages (including those of other explorers inspired by him) were the direct cause of probably tens of millions of deaths.</p>
<p>By some estimates, as much as 90% of the human population of the New World died from Old World diseases.  Just in terms of death toll, it was probably the largest human catastrophe, <i>ever.</i></p>
<p>That massive crossover of species (diseases, animals, plants, people, etc., etc.) is now called the Columbian Exchange.</p>
<p>But if it hadn&#8217;t been Columbus, it would have been somebody else.  Nautical technology was improving.  The status quo that half the planet was shielded by isolation from the other half&#8217;s diseases could not be sustained.  Even if they had any idea what would happen, there was absolutely nothing that the people of the 1400s, on either side of the Atlantic, could have done to prevent it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>We can never say with certainty what a being much more intelligent than us could or could not do with a given set of resources, so I understand the need for caution, regardless.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a question for those who worry that a superintelligence, even if confined to a box (i.e. can communicate with us via text or voice but has no robot body or other physical extension), could, through the pure power of persuasion, convince humans to do whatever it wanted, including building an army of super terminator bodies to house itself, or wiping out the human race:</p>
<p>Dogs and cats may be very stupid compared to us, but would you be able to control the behavior of a pack of dogs through verbal commands alone (through a telephone hooked up to a loudspeaker say)? But dogs can&#8217;t understand human language you say. Okay, but what if the degree of complexity human language can express is, to the AI, analogous to the degree of complexity we can communicate to dogs through grunts, growls, and varied intonations?</p>
<p>For that matter, can you control small children who do understand human language? Even if you have access to candy and video games and spanking paddles, making small children behave as you want them to is a difficult proposition at best, even though they are much stupider than us and can understand human language reasonably well. But could you get them to do what you wanted just by talking to them alone? And even if you could, could you get them to build say, a microchip, through your instructions alone? And how much less so could you control an ant though pure verbal instructions, even though ants are much stupider and their motivations and behaviors much more transparent? </p>
<p>It seems that, far from becoming easier to control through logical suasion and pure verbal commands, things get harder to control the further they are from us down the intelligence scale. </p>
<p>So, if we can&#8217;t control children with any reliability, why would an AI the intelligence of which was to ours as ours is to children be able to control us, especially if doesn&#8217;t have access to super drugs and sex robots and electrical shocks to &#8220;train&#8221; us? And if an AI confined to a box were as intelligent relative to us as we are to ants why should it have any more luck controlling us than we have controlling ants through a cell phone?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>things get harder to control the further they are from us down the intelligence scale</p></blockquote>
<p>Seems more likely to be an absolute than a relative issue; perhaps beings get <em>easier</em> to control the farther <em>up</em> the scale, i.e. the more they possess the abilities to make inferences, understand consequences, entertain hypothetical scenarios, etc. We can&#8217;t control kids because it&#8217;s hard to make them adopt time- and goal-oriented thinking, but the same problem wouldn&#8217;t apply to a superintelligence trying to control us.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>This makes a certain amount of sense, and might mean that our goal-oriented, conceptual thinking could be our Achilles heel in dealing with an AI or alien life, though I think reflection on the problem of manipulating children or animals also shows that you have to be much, much smarter than a creature to be able to understand its thinking and motivation enough to effectively manipulate it. Like, we can predict with a high degree of probability, I assume, how bacteria or nematodes or maybe even fish will react to certain stimuli, but it gets more complicated if you want to train a dog really well, and really starts to move into the realm of art and finesse. </p>
<p>Like, if you were an IQ 150 person in a world where the average IQ was 60, you might be able to get yourself made into a king, or maybe you&#8217;d be hated as some kind of wizard. It would probably be extremely difficult to get everyone to commit suicide by the power of your words alone. Mostly, you&#8217;d probably just find it very frustrating. </p>
<p>So if we imagine an AI of IQ equivalent 300 and the ability to talk to us, but no physical extension, it might simply find us very dense and annoying yet not be able to do much about it. Now I know that some people are talking about IQ 10,000 or whatever, at which point I guess all bets are off, but it might give us some cushion to realize that an AI which is merely somewhat smarter than us will probably not automatically take over the world.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Ah ha! I never noticed before that eugenics is a pathway to a human intelligence explosion.</p>
<p>In general, an intelligence explosion is possible whenever an intelligent agent becomes sufficiently intelligent to improve on the process that made it intelligent. Then you just need a sequence of further innovations, each reachable by applying the previous innovation (i.e. a ladder to climb).</p>
<p>Since the late 19th century, we&#8217;ve understood the basic process that generated our intelligence; and it&#8217;s pretty easy to see that we could improve on it (via selective breeding). Moreover, even with our current low IQs we can imagine future technologies (like direct genetic engineering) that could improve IQs further. So there&#8217;s no reason to think there aren&#8217;t many more steps on the ladder.</p>
<p>It makes me kind of sad to think that we&#8217;ve (so far) missed out on our chance for an intelligence explosion. If we had gotten on board with this a century ago, we could quite possibly be post-singularity already. (Imagine that everyone born in the 1930s had John von Neumann for a father. And that&#8217;s just generation 1.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Was it? I thought it was just to improve the human condition a bit. I&#8217;m not sure if the explosive potential of iterating on increased intelligence was ever understood.</p>
<p>For instance, take Brave New World as an example of the sort of &#8220;utopia&#8221; eugenicists were envisioning. Clearly they weren&#8217;t carrying out an intelligence explosion, though they easily could have.</p>
<p>Also, my understanding (which could be wrong) was that eugenicists were more focused on reducing the low end of the distribution (sterilizing undesirables and avoiding dysgenic effects) than selective breeding for high-end intelligence.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The original explanation for Superman&#8217;s powers (which at the start were vastly less than the modern version) was that they were the product of centuries of Kryptonian eugenic programs. So it is clear that at least in the popular imagination, eugenics was envisioned as having very lofty goals.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Do you have a cite for the <em>Superman</em> thing? I&#8217;m surprised by that. The popular taste in America has generally been quite anti-eugenics, and was even more so by 1939; it was the elites who flirted with it in the 1920s.</p>
<p>I tried looking, but the only reference I found was in Fredric Wertham&#8217;s anti-comics manifesto <em>Seduction of the Innocent</em>, of which I&#8217;m skeptical for obvious reasons.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I just googled and read a few pages of Seigel and Schuster&#8217;s early Superman comics.  They refer to Kryptonians as being &#8220;advanced in evolution&#8221; and of Superman as having a &#8220;physical structure millions of years advanced of their [the humans] own.&#8221;</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t sound like eugenics to me, that sounds like the standard teleological evolution that one frequently finds in science fiction stories that don&#8217;t understand how evolution or natural selection works.   In the 1930s, and even today, there are a lot of people whose understanding of evolution is that as time and generations pass, creatures become more and more &#8220;advanced&#8221; for no apparent reason other than it&#8217;s &#8220;evolution.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Right.</p>
<p>The contingent on here—which I hope is louder than it is large—so concerned about the &#8220;filthy dysgenic savages&#8221; or saying we should all be Mormons in order to keep atheism from selecting against intelligence&#8230;they seem absurdly out of touch.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s on the level of Jefferson wanting a nation of yeoman farmers, or people wondering when New York City will become uninhabitable because of the sheer quantity of horse manure on the streets.</p>

<p>I got into genetics because I want to see human germline modification in my lifetime, but it won&#8217;t be a panacea. If modified people follow the same inverse correlation between intelligence and fertility that exists in western society all widespread modification will do is accelerate our current problems. </p>
<p>Even with modification, joining or creating a community similar to Mormons et al might still be the your best bet of actually having descendants of any IQ.</p>

<p>Whatever we want to happen because natural selection is now out of the game.</p>
<p>If these people have less fertility but live for 300 years, there&#8217;s no problem. If we can &#8220;vaccinate against stupidity&#8221;, there&#8217;s no problem.</p>
<p>You are arguing that these low-IQ or high-religion people are going to breed so much faster than everyone else and have such a high retention rate that modernity is going to fall to some kind of &#8220;Yellow Peril&#8221; or &#8220;Romanists Hand Over America to the Pope&#8221; situation. You are arguing that either dysgenics or dysmemics (?) is going to outpace both science and the liberal values of our civilization.</p>
<p>Every time someone in the past thought that was going to happen&#8230;it didn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>For one thing, there&#8217;s more to the spread of an ideology than amount by which it encourages its members to breed.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Natural selection will only be &#8220;out of the game&#8221; when life itself is. For all intents and purposes it is the game.</p>
<p>As for the supposed power of memetics, are you familiar with the Shakers? A bit of an extreme example but an instructive one. They thought that a celibate society could sustain itself indefinitely solely by converting adults but eventually discovered, to paraphrase Thatcher, that the problem with evangelism is eventually you run out of other people&#8217;s children.</p>
<p>Even if you take the route of Reform Judaism vis a vis the Orthodox and try to pair a sub-replacement fertility high-IQ secular society with a low retention high-IQ religious one, that can&#8217;t hold forever. Sooner or later either traits which reduce susceptibility to the secular memes will reach fixation; the &#8220;memes&#8221; themselves will change into a less self-destructive form; or the whole thing will come crashing down.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@ Dr Dealgood:</p>
<p>The Shakers were a very small movement (peaked at 6,000 according to Wikipedia) preaching a fanatic religious doctrine completely opposed to the requirements of human life and happiness—in addition to demanding celibacy.</p>
<p>As for Reform vs. Orthodox Judaism, all the Reform Jews came out of Orthodoxy the first time, didn&#8217;t they? I don&#8217;t see why they can&#8217;t do it again.</p>
<p>In America, a lot of the Reform Jews&#8217; descendants are not counted because they&#8217;ve simply interbred and assimilated. In Israel, the situation is more serious, but I would bet against the theory that they are going to &#8220;take over the country&#8221; in any serious way. In the unlikely event they do, it will have a great deal to do with the fact that Israel&#8217;s atmosphere of constant danger encourages extremism, otherworldliness, and an apocalyptic viewpoint.</p>
<p>Look, liberalism already beat traditional values of every description the first time. It whipped &#8217;em once, and it&#8217;ll whip &#8217;em again.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Vox</p>
<p>I beg to differ.</p>
<p>You would have a case if genetic makeup had no influence on susceptibility to various ideologies, personality, etc. However, since it does, and since liberalism, in evolutionary terms, is a horrible disease that makes you infertile if you catch it and even association with people who have it while not being infected oneself is deleterious, over time the prevalence of people susceptible to believing in liberalism will go down.</p>
<p>That is &#8211; unless there mutates a version of liberalism that is competitive versus traditional ideologies on the fertility aspect. If there is such a critter, I haven&#8217;t seen it yet.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My point was simply that our species reached the intelligence explosion threshold a century ago, though we chose not to adopt the first round of intelligence improvements we discovered. </p>
<p>I agree that the next round of innovations are on the horizon, and threaten to render the century-old ones obsolete (though we haven&#8217;t learned how to increase intelligence via genetic engineering yet).</p>
<p>I completely agree that undergoing our own intelligence explosion seems like a much better idea than creating a new alien species, letting it undergo its own uncontrolled intelligence explosion, and hoping it&#8217;s friendly.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>There&#8217;s got to be <i>something</i> more interesting going on than how big a brain you can fit through your birth canal, or animals with bigger birth canals would already have taken over the world.  African elephants have close to the neuron counts we do (higher, if you count the nervous system outside the brain), and much bigger cranial vaults.  They&#8217;re even pretty dextrous, with their trunks, and sometimes use simple tools.  Why didn&#8217;t we preenact the first half of <i>Footfall</i> on the Serengeti 200,000 years ago?</p>
<p>Well, I don&#8217;t know, but I&#8217;m pretty sure there&#8217;s something nontrivial behind it.  (On the small-brain side of things, corvids and parrots have brains the size of an almond but seem to be smarter than most mammals.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Well, that&#8217;s <i>suggestive</i>, all right, but there&#8217;s nothing saying that recent selection pressure must have been in the direction of greater intelligence.  The Neolithic Revolution had a lot of effects that look a little perverse from a modern perspective: turns out that early farming enabled denser, more organized populations, but at the cost of health (or at least height, which is a good proxy for it) and longevity.  Some populations didn&#8217;t make up the difference until the 1900s.  Why not intelligence too?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be interested to see a graph of braincase volume through the agricultural transition, but I don&#8217;t think anyone&#8217;s done that research.  Even that&#8217;s an imperfect proxy, of course, for reasons I&#8217;ve already gone into.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think intelligence is, at least to some extent, a function of brain size relative to body size. Whales have bigger brains than us, but most of the extra space is expended on controlling their huge bodies. We have by far the biggest brain-to-body size ratio, which is why the birth canal thing is also an issue. If we were being birthed by mothers the size of whales (insert &#8220;your mother&#8221; joke here), then a head twice as big as the one we have now would not be such an issue (other than the additional neck strength that would be required to carry it, I guess); but birthing a head twice as big as the one we have now would be, given the size of human females, whose hips are already unusually wide, I&#8217;d say, compared to other mammals. </p>
<p>Related to the issue of brain size and body size: I&#8217;ve read that while it is very easy to make a computer which can solve difficult physics problems, it is much, much harder to make a robot arm which can do even a seemingly simple movement task, like picking up a coin in physical space. Ultimately our brains are there to help us successfully navigate space through movement (note that no fully stationary creature has a brain: apparently there is even a sea creature which has a small brain in its first, mobile stage of development, but which digests said brain once it attaches itself to a rock and becomes, in essence, a plant (a process which has been compared to academic tenure)), and movement is a lot more complicated than it seems.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m aware of the brain-to-body-mass hypothesis, but I find it unsatisfying in some ways.  Unless there&#8217;s some process binding the physical size of neurons to the size of the body parts they help control, the important thing shouldn&#8217;t be the <i>ratio</i> of brain size to body size but rather the <i>overhead</i> left after you subtract the brain volume dedicated to motor control and those parts of sensory processing that&#8217;d scale with body size: if you&#8217;ve got a billion neurons left over for long-term planning and writing <i>Hamlet</i> and all that other prefrontal cortex stuff, it&#8217;s still a billion neurons whether it&#8217;s in a braincase the size of a grapefruit or a Buick.  </p>
<p>There&#8217;s of course no guarantee that this overhead exists in, say, an elephant, but it&#8217;s easier to create it in something elephant-sized without running into hard physical problems, since braincase volume &#8212; or at least the potential for it &#8212; scales with mass while constraints like the birth canal scale with linear size.  Which leaves us with the same problem we had originally.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yeah, I know what you mean, and if I were reasoning from behind a veil of ignorance about intelligence and body mass, I would probably predict that the smartest animals would also be the largest, or at least close to it, since, yeah, the extra amount of brain needed to write Hamlet in addition to whatever amount they need to control a gigantic body would seem trivial for say, a brontosaurus or blue whale (especially a blue whale, since extra weight is easier to carry underwater, whereas making the head bigger on a creature with such a long neck as a brontosaurus might be a pretty big energetic cost), given the size they already have and the calories they already have to take in. </p>
<p>Additional explanations I can imagine for why this didn&#8217;t happen: intelligence is less useful than we imagine, at least until reaches the making tools stage; evolution is even more energetically parsimonious than we already think we know it is; evolution doesn&#8217;t come up with everything that it would make sense for it to come up with; we are actually pretty big so far as creatures on Earth go, so even though we&#8217;re not the largest, we&#8217;re still large enough that we aren&#8217;t a really odd candidate for species which happened to evolve enough extra brain to write Hamlet first, etc.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t think that the claims are precise enough to distinguish between multiplicative and additive. People just plot lots of species brain/body ratios and the ones above the trend jump out as smart.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not brain/body ratio, but brain/body^c, where people agree that the exponent is less than 1, but can&#8217;t agree on whether it&#8217;s 2/3 or 3/4 &#8211; that&#8217;s how noisy the data is.</p>
<p>The exponent 2/3 sounds like a square-cube law, while 3/4 sounds like a correction for some overhead in fanning out the signals. But both sound crazy to me. Do I have any more input or output bandwidth than a mouse? I probably have the same number of muscles as a mouse, indeed, pretty much corresponding muscles. Maybe I have more muscle cells that need individual neurons, but that fanning out can be done outside the brain. Input might grow according to a square-cube law, but output sounds more like a unit power.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>One other thought I had as to why we developed a high level intelligence before whales, despite their advantages: I have tended to assume that we have such dexterous hands in order to take advantage of our intelligence, but maybe we have intelligence in order to take advantage of our dexterous hands. Consider:</p>
<p>The first big advantage of intelligence isn&#8217;t writing Hamlet, it&#8217;s making and using simple tools. But if you have flippers or big paws for swimming or running then there is less immediate advantage to gaining the intelligence to make tools. Primates, however, seem all to have dexterous hands&#8211;not just chimps, but even monkeys which are relatively dumb as monkeys go&#8211;presumably for climbing trees, picking fruit, grooming, digging up bugs, throwing feces&#8230;</p>
<p>As with many things in evolution, I guess, the question tends to be not &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t it make sense for x to have trait y?&#8221; but &#8220;given x creature&#8217;s current qualities, in which quality y would a tweak in some direction confer a fairly immediate benefit?&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Arguably, for whales this isn&#8217;t true, but the obvious trait we have that other apes don&#8217;t that makes intelligence tremendously more advantageous is we&#8217;re physiologically capable of sufficiently complex spoken language to pass on oral traditions.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I have seen the argument made that dexterity goes with intelligence, and separately social interaction goes with intelligence as well.</p>
<p>So according to this idea, octopuses are extremely dexterous, but antisocial, and are pretty intelligent. Dolphins are extremely social, but not dexterous, and also pretty intelligent. Humans got both and are therefore the most intelligent of all.</p>

<p>(I am being slightly tongue-in-cheek, but it is true. Octopus is a third declension Latin word, not second declension.)</p>

<p>&#8220;For all intensive purposes, it&#8217;s a doggy dog world&#8221; is, in some sense, an English expression.</p>
<p>Anyway, I find that &#8220;octopi&#8221; is generally used by people going for a certain sense of superiority they think the word has over &#8220;octopuses&#8221;. An air of refinement.</p>
<p>They may be interested to know that it does not grant this impression to people who know the correct form.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Octopus was coined into neo-Latin from Greek in like the seventeenth century. Whatever the faults of those who prefer &#8220;octopi,&#8221; it would seem a little hasty to characterize them as bourgeois pretenders to classical education.</p>
<p>Anyway, a little google-booksing shows that octopi is all the hell over the place, so it is certainly a word, with stronger claims than octopodes which is at best half as well attested. The charitable explanation would be that octopi, formed by analogy with other Latinate plurals drilled in elementary school, sounds cleaner than octopuses. Here and elsewhere, word-final s causes aesthetic offense in the case of plurals and possessives, and some speakers avoid it where possible, and Latin/Greek third-declension plurals are too rarely employed in English to constitute a go-to solution that any critical mass of speakers would be familiar with.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Brain size relative to body size is a good but not perfect predictor. I agree that not every animal is limited by birth canal. I think that there&#8217;s a hard problem of doing real engineering work to get high intelligence, and several easy hacks that move intelligence around the space defined by your current position in the hard problem. For example, you can add +10 IQ points by giving someone torsion dystonia, but then they&#8217;ve got torsion dystonia. You can add +100 IQ points by giving someone von Neumann&#8217;s genome, but that only lasts one generation before they have to marry someone else and all those genes get redistributed again in a chaotic way.</p>
<p>Select for high intelligence over a few generations and you get the easy hacks. Select for it over eons, and you get breakthroughs on the hard problem. I think modern humans are a combination of both. But there&#8217;s a lot of room for more easy hacks, and there would be more room if we could solve problems like torsion dystonia and head size and genetic entropy or if it were in a computer-type entity that didn&#8217;t <i>need</i> to solve them.</p>

<p>When you think about it in these terms, it&#8217;s pretty strange that most people are completely unconcerned with researchers fooling around with the genetic code of highly advanced aliens, whereas we&#8217;re *really* concerned about researchers making minor changes to human genes.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Hard takeoff from flatworm to superhuman intelligence which inevitably wipes out humanity is a very scary possibility. However, the idea that Dr. Evil et al. somewhere in an underground lab invent a general algorithm for an intelligence improving itself and re-writing its code without any exposure to a real world seems too fantastic.</p>
<p>I’m more worried about existing environment for AI to evolve. There are rats, raccoons, pigeons and numerous bugs in modern cities, and humans don’t do much to control their population. I wonder, are there similar ecological niches for wild sub-human AIs in today world? And when do we expect them to be populated? And how we’ll control evolution of such free roaming AIs?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>We already have numerous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash_(cryptocurrency)" rel="nofollow">anonymous cryptocurrencies</a>, which government have very little control of. We already have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2P" rel="nofollow">an overlay network</a> specifically designed to withstand censorship. We are moving very fast towards implementing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum" rel="nofollow">smart-contracts platform</a>. What we still lack (AFAIK) is a market for secure computation services.</p>
<p>Once we&#8217;ve got all these ingredients, there would be a breeding enviromnent for an AI. Imagine power of open-ended virtual evolution competing with humans on prediction markets. At some point AIs will be major players on the markets. And given the resilience of the infrastructure we are building now, there would be no simple way to stop AIs from proliferating &#8211; not until we as humanity unite and solve all our social problems.</p>
<p>I think this &#8220;AI in the wild&#8221; scenario is way more realistic than scenario when AI is raised to a superhuman state in a box.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Tangentially, I find it very funny that I wrote two novels which had as a sub-plot the following:</p>
<p>1) There is a simple (it&#8217;s not easy: it is simple) way to make current computer technology work so well that it can sustain sentient AI starting with not much more than Game of Life level programming skills.<br />
2) In response to this, the governments of the world all have secret paramilitary law enforcement units whose sole purpose is to watch out for people who learn #1 and stop them before they create Skynet by accident.<br />
3) There is an easy (it&#8217;s not simple: it is easy) way to maintain absolute control of an AI, which nobody knows about. Well, almost nobody.</p>
<p>&#8230; long before I ever <i>heard</i> of any of these movements/countermovements, Dr. Evil, Dr. Good, or Dr. Amoral. I don&#8217;t know why, but I do. 🙂</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think you&#8217;re confused about what OpenAI means by &#8220;AI&#8221;. There does not exist any source code today, released or secret, that increases AGI (*general* intelligence) risk.</p>
<p>Yet it&#8217;s easy to imagine OpenAI-like projects continuing in the same spirit when AGI-relevant things are being discovered, and at that point, yes, you&#8217;re right that we should hesitate and ponder.</p>
<p>This reminds me of your ongoing theme that it&#8217;s hard to advocate for the virtue of [specific] silence.</p>
<p>I imagine their pro-open calculation is: whether or not we share our discoveries and encourage others to do so, there is no stopping secret discoveries sufficient to eventually guarantee severe AGI risk. If you outlaw AGI research, only outlaws will discover AGI.</p>
<p>To prevent or delay AGI happening, simply locate and closely control all people of sufficient (+3 SD?) intelligence to make progress. Else it seems impossible.</p>

<p>This is an argument for having such people in corporations, though, not so much non-profits committed to openness.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Fictional evidence is only evidence of what fiction authors think. Iain Banks is not clever enough to imagine a superintelligence. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s like the difference between a guy who plays chess twice a year writing a story about a chess program playing a human from the computer&#8217;s POV, versus actually being able to predict what moves the program will make. I can confidently predict that no human can beat the best programs &#8211; that the games will reliably end in victory for the AI &#8211; but not how the programs will actually win. Similarly, Banks can talk about Minds, but he&#8217;s actually just invoking magic &#8211; he can&#8217;t even predict what things a Mind would try to achieve (beyond &#8220;things that are good for the Culture, maybe?&#8221;), let alone how a Mind would go about achieving them.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;Wells’ thesis was that the coming atomic bombs would be so deadly that we would inevitably create a utopian one-world government to prevent them from ever being used. Sorry, Wells. It was a nice thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;But imagine that in the 1910s and 1920s, the period’s intellectual and financial elites had started thinking really seriously along Wellsian lines. Imagine what might happen when the first nation – let’s say America – got the Bomb. It would be totally unstoppable in battle and could take over the entire world and be arbitrarily dictatorial. Such a situation would be the end of human freedom and progress.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty much the plot of Robert Heinlein&#8217;s most brilliant sci-fi story, &#8220;Solution Unsatisfactory,&#8221; which he finished on 12/24/1940:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_Unsatisfactory" rel="nofollow ugc">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_Unsatisfactory</a></p>
<p>Heinlein was a devoted fan of Wells: there&#8217;s a nice scene in the recent Heinlein bio of Heinlein, in his pre-writing days, going to a book signing event by the elderly, over the hill Wells. The two strangers, the past and future of sci-fi, immediately hit it off and converse for 5 minutes while the impatient line backs up behind the young Heinlein.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>What I liked about &#8220;Solution Unsatisfactory,&#8221; and the reason I eventually based a college course on it, was that, so far as I could tell, at every point the central character made the right choice&#8211;and the story still ends with a situation that is going to lead to catastrophe. It&#8217;s tempting to assume that if there are only two possible solutions to a problem, once you have eliminated one you are finished. But there is no reason to assume that all problems have solutions.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t think OpenAI exists to try to pool resources to solve something like the AI control problem. OpenAI exists to try to mitigate the damage that something like China&#8217;s &#8220;Sesame credit&#8221; score can do. (If you haven&#8217;t heard of it &#8211; China is developing a system to assign what is basically a &#8220;loyalty to government&#8221; score, based on things like your social media posts, and who you associate with. The full details are terrifying.) At least if the best-known algorithms are publicly available, people have a chance of countering this sort of thing. Otherwise, we have a case where those large organizations with cutting edge (but secret) AI/ML and access to enough data are simply able to make terrifyingly accurate predictions about you and your behavior, for reasons you don&#8217;t understand, in ways you can&#8217;t stop. AI &#8220;danger&#8221; comes in many forms.</p>
<p>If I were to use the &#8220;weapons&#8221; analogy, strong-AI may be a world-ending nuclear bomb, but we&#8217;ve only recently passed the &#8220;figured out that gunpowder can be used to shoot a bullet stage&#8221;. Developing a nuke is an absurdly dangerous proposition, no matter how you go about it. But we&#8217;re not building nukes right now, just guns, and it would be nice to see them not only in the hands of of the Chinese politburo.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t have very concrete views on this issue, but I think they&#8217;re pretty close to this. Yeah, unfriendly AIs capable of taking over the world would be a very bad thing, but it would be very strange if we got to them without first passing through a stage containing things that if misused by a human, would be pretty bad. While that probably doesn&#8217;t constitute an existential threat, it still seems like something we&#8217;d like to stop, and like something the OpenAI project could address.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The question isn&#8217;t &#8220;should AI be open?&#8221;</p>
<p>The question is &#8220;can AI not be open?&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems more like a materialistic issue than an idealist one.</p>
<p>The reason nukes aren&#8217;t open source isn&#8217;t because &#8220;we&#8221; (who? The UN?) decided that they shouldn&#8217;t be; nukes aren&#8217;t open source because nukes are really hard to create in practice. The basic principles are easy stuff, but I don&#8217;t know of any way of enriching large quantities of Uranium that is especially easy for non-state actors to do. On the country scale, of course, any country can have nukes when it wants nukes. Moratoriums haven&#8217;t stopped North Korea, and negotiations are only stalling tactics with Iran.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, nukes were incredibly easy to make and required little specialized material, then they would be widely available regulations or not. If men in sheds in Pakistan could crank out nukes as easily as they could crank out AK variants, then an increasingly distributed large number of nukes would become available in the world. That would be the outcome. Regulations would be able to slow the leak rate of the technology from large institutions, but the ability of regulations to work once in place depends on people&#8217;s willingness to follow the law, and how easy it is to enforce it. If dangerously powerful AGI software can be run on home machines (the hardware would have to become more powerful but whatever), it will leak at some point, and then the distribution will go exponential. If however, AGI can only be achieved for a long long time by large organizations that have the resources to supply the hardware, then to be sure, these organizations can be monitored and regulated, but they are at little risk of open sourcing their projects in a completely uncontrolled manner, because they cannot materially do so to begin with.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Sure it can. How do you know that there&#8217;s no easier way to make a nuclear bomb? Because lots of people understand how they work.

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;If the Manhattan Project scientists had realised that nukes can be made out of car engines, do you think the REAL theories of particle physics would be taught to anyone not totally trusted?&#8221; </p>
<p>The problem is that I don&#8217;t think the government is that good at keeping secrets, and that it&#8217;d leak at some point. Once it does leak, it becomes harder to stop it leaking further and then it&#8217;s out there.</p>
<p>If the Manhattan scientists had discovered a way of making nuke engines, then they obviously took a pact to never reveal this beyond their own circle, and this pact held, because otherwise the US government itself would use this method to beat out the Russians. In reality, the secret of the bomb did leak to the Russians through spies. If there was an even easier method of making nukes, it&#8217;s even more likely to have leaked, because with easier methods, you can fill in gaps in the knowledge required to fulfill them more easily than if there was a more complicated method that required certain materials to be primed just so. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that it&#8217;s impossible to keep secrets, just that it becomes harder the easier the secret is to independently replicate (perhaps even based on incomplete information + inferences and testing), so the easier the nuclear weapons were to make, the more likely they were to spread to begin with.</p>
<p>For example, I already have a great deal of the information needed to create a nuclear weapon. I just lack uranium and the ability to enrich it without a very large facility. If that suddenly changes and someone comes up with a way to magically conjure weapons grade Uranium (or Plutonium), making the process easier, they have also instantly allowed it to be far more open sourceable, and now every terrorist in the world can just perform the incantation to get nuclear material, and then use local experts/internet information to refine and test the weapon. </p>
<p>Blam! Nukes everywhere. It&#8217;s about far more than just <i>deciding</i> to open source things or not.</p>
<p>&#8220;One very good way to make sure that AI doesn’t become open source is to make it really dificult to learn how to make an AI. Having an open-source collaborative AI-building project means that lots of enthusiasts can collaborate in their spare time, rather than having to work with an organisation like MIRI or Google that has people saying “NEVER CALL UP WHAT YOU CANNOT PUT DOWN”.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem is that you don&#8217;t beat Mr.Amoral that way. The government could try to make a regulation that you cannot work on AI unless you do so with MIRI or Google, but what would that regulation look like, and how would you craft it in such a nuanced way that you didn&#8217;t cripple the economy? After all, new players will emerge, and what about already existing AI that is modifiable? What exactly are you allowed to change about AI? What even is an AI? What counts and what doesn&#8217;t?</p>
<p>How exactly do you enforce this and stop other corporations from coming along and doing open source projects in less obvious ways? Again, I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s impossible, and I&#8217;m just saying that &#8220;can you&#8221;, and &#8220;how&#8221; are the important questions here. The track record of regulations at stopping the &#8220;open sourcing&#8221; of movies in spite of the pressure of huge entertainment corporations in lock step with government has been abysmal.</p>
<p>AI is different, of course, in that you require expertise and knowledge to contribute to it, but it should be similarly hard to stop organizations from open sourcing access to their projects by skilled amateurs.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the issue of competition between states. Even if the US government, packed to the nines with people who barely understand the internet let alone AI, were to craft the exact right regulations that manage to contain significant AI development (even as further technological development makes it easier to contribute by less skilled persons) without harming the economy, you still have the issue of competition between states. How do you get China, or Russia to accept MIRI&#8217;s recommended regulations? How do you do so without first associating the regulations with US control of AI? You have to convince different nation-states with deteriorating relations that their &#8220;coherent extrapolated volition&#8221; is our &#8220;coherent extrapolated volition&#8221;.</p>
<p>Until the &#8220;how&#8221; (or &#8220;can we&#8221;) is addressed in a totally comprehensive way, and you have a huge document of proposals that:<br />
(A: The US government is likely to put into place<br />
B: &#8230;do not destroy the economy by being poorly thought out<br />
C: &#8230;Do not become associated too strongly with a US &#8220;plot&#8221; through A, so that&#8230;<br />
D: We can apply these regulations worldwide, and&#8230;<br />
E: They are actually enforceable mechanically and work)<br />
&#8230;then I&#8217;m on the open source &#8220;side&#8221;, because it won&#8217;t be a matter of calling things up that you can&#8217;t put down, but a matter of things calling themselves up out of the scramble.</p>
<p>Yes, MIRI is all about solving &#8220;friendly AI&#8221;, but how much thought has it given to <i>selling</i> friendly AI, and having friendly AI enforced realistically?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Nope. Firstly, there are a great many fates worse than death, and many of them look like ill-designed utopias you can&#8217;t escape.

<p>Secondly, an ill-designed AI can&#8217;t be persuaded by moral arguments any more than a rock can. You can&#8217;t throw yourself on the mercy of a paperclip-maximiser.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>John Brunner&#8217;s <em>The Jagged Orbit</em> studied a society where AI (not by that name) is critical to any sort of political power or influence.  Basically if you&#8217;ve got a better AI than everyone else, you&#8217;re able to run rings around them, because the AI can tell you what to do to achieve your goals.  Also you can&#8217;t put anything on TV without getting an AI to approve it, since otherwise your insurance won&#8217;t cover the inevitable lawsuits, and signing a contract without getting an AI to vet it for you is practically suicidal, and so on.  Even the Federal Government, if I remember rightly, was largely unable to so much as influence the larger international corporations, because they couldn&#8217;t match their computer budget.</p>
<p>OK, there was also some sort of psionics, and a time-travel theme, but AI in general was a critical part of the context and one specific AI was a core element of the plot. 🙂</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The problem there is that as soon as someone tells a superhuman AI to invent an even better AI, they get *exponentially* better AIs. </p>
<p>Also, persuading people is an intellectual endeavour, so we can expect superhuman AIs to be ridiculously charismatic. (Look up &#8220;Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis&#8221; &#8211; the only plausible explanation for how humans became so clever so quickly is a giant evolutionary pressure, but those tend to wipe out species, so we need a pressure that grows over time. The only good explanation is that protohumans got smarter to play life-and-death politics with other smarter protohumans.) </p>
<p>Also also, it handwaves how AIs are made to do what humans want. Even if they can be constrained, look up &#8220;the traitorous turn&#8221; &#8211; a superhuman AI that secretly wants to do something humans will try to prevent will reveal its treachery precisely when it (correctly) believes that we can&#8217;t stop it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>[Spoilers!]</p>
<p>If I remember rightly, in the context of this particular story (which was after all written in 1969) the constraints on an AI&#8217;s capabilities were physical &#8211; how big a computer you could afford to build, and (depending on your goals) how well you could keep it secret.  So there was no out-of-control-exponential-growth curve per se.</p>
<p>The AI that was the focal point of the plot (the first and only self-aware one, so far as I could tell) nonetheless managed to help wipe out humanity.  Luckily, that was incompatible with its assigned goal &#8211; to maximize its owner&#8217;s profits &#8211; so it decided to invent time travel. 🙂</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ll believe in the effectiveness of &#8220;OpenAI&#8221; when we have &#8220;OpenGoogle&#8221;. That is, <em>right now</em>, a huge number of people suffer from the algorithmic whims of a computation, business rise and fall, political factions fight over supposed favoritism. But one can&#8217;t even figure out why any particular effect is happening. It&#8217;s a closely-guarded secret. But fear the future Skynets, everyone. Or maybe I just made an argument supporting the peril of Skynet, as possibly being much worse.</p>
<p>[Note, I know there&#8217;s open-source search engine code. But it seems to me that there&#8217;s a big disconnect between the impact of Google, versus what&#8217;s widely known about the &#8220;AI&#8221; of it. There&#8217;s some sort of lesson here for &#8220;OpenAI&#8221;, which is both highly speculative, and trying to influence political debate.]</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Here, I find myself in the unusual situation of talking down well formed AI risk arguments ^_^</p>
<p>The situation is not just &#8220;fast vs slow&#8221;, but also &#8220;early vs late&#8221;. An early AI still seems very unlikely, meaning that everything that isn&#8217;t a direct safety measure is just background noise for the moment. The other piece of the argument is that *if* AI can be developed soon, it&#8217;s much better to do so when the hardware is underdeveloped and less likely to enable an intelligence explosion (the case is clearest if we&#8217;re worried about AI superpowered via rapid copying).</p>
<p>Now, these arguments are my best estimates, but, upon writing them, it strikes me that I may be overconfident. I will think more, and ask around the FHI.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That is indeed a rare event!</p>
<p>Early AGI seems pretty likely to quite a lot of people, myself included. (See, here, for example: <a rel="nofollow"href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/survey.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/survey.pdf</a>). I&#8217;ve not yet seen a satisfying argument that AI will come late. The main ones seem to be &#8220;AI is really hard&#8221; and &#8220;we keep predicting it within twenty years and being wrong&#8221;. The problem is that *we can&#8217;t rely on these arguments, even if they&#8217;re valid*. Every hard problem looks impossible until someone solves it, and arguments from historical patterns of overconfidence don&#8217;t let us distinguish between correct predictions and incorrect ones. A stopped clock is right twice a day. </p>
<p>Also, there are pretty good reasons for thinking that once you have something as smart as a rat, making something much smarter than a human is pretty easy (note how ridiculously smart humans are compared to chimps, and how little evolutionary time turned hominids into modern humans), and that there are only a small number of (comparatively) basic tricks to making something as smart as a rat. </p>
<p>As to hardware, I disagree entirely. We long ago passed the point where an AI with internet access would have enough resources to become superintelligent just by stealing (or even buying!) memory and CPU cycles. (Think about how much computational effort is being put into bitcoin mining, then think about that being put to use by a AGI.) Unless we manage to invent an AGI-proof AI box (fat chance!), the computational resources on one computer don&#8217;t constrain an AGIs growth once it finds out the internet exists. It&#8217;s not obvious to me how we could invent something smart enough to edit its own source code for efficient processing but not smart enough to work out that other computers exist.</p>

<p>Suppose you get an AI that understands what a human is, and understands what &#8216;being alive&#8217; is, but its utility function is literally to make people smile.

I keep hearing concerns about it, but I&#8217;m not clear on how AI would differ from the digital organism/ecosystem that we have already created (the Internet) and that seems to be evolving and gaining new adaptive processes and behaviors on a daily basis, and in what seems to me to be a pretty open source fashion. The Internet may not be a human-like intelligence, but it is certainly an evolving system, with its own drives and priorities separate from those of its host organism, and the balance of network-dependence-on-humans / human-dependence-on-network is rapidly shifting.</p>
<p>What is it I&#8217;m missing?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Let&#8217;s define intelligence as &#8220;efficient cross-domain optimisation&#8221;. That means the ability to steer the future towards outcomes the intelligence prefers (optimisation), in many different fields (cross-domain), using few resources (including time) to get a given level of optimisation power (efficiency). An Artifical General Intelligence is a corss-domain optimiser (like a human, for example). We have AIs that are better than humans (e.g. chess computers), but we&#8217;ve not invented an AGI yet. The internet might be a complex system which we can&#8217;t easily understand, but it&#8217;s not an optimiser &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t steer the future towards outcomes it prefers. Particular programs can do things humans can&#8217;t and can run things for us while we do other stuff, but there&#8217;s nothing that can be told &#8220;achieve this result&#8221; that will then invent a new way to do that. If we want a new solution to a problem, we need either a human or an evolutionary algorithm designed by a human for a narrow task.</p>
<p>Evolution is a powerful cross-domain optimiser, but it&#8217;s incredibly inefficient &#8211; it takes millions or billions of years to invent things humans could invent in months or years. Think about something that can design a system as complex as a human from the ground up, inventing proteins, DNA, cells et cetera along the way &#8211; an optimiser as powerful as evolution &#8211; then imagine that it can do that on a human timescale (or even faster). That&#8217;s a terrifying prospect. </p>
<p>The rest of the worry come from noticing that computers do what you say, not what you mean; that it&#8217;s really hard to specify exactly what you mean to something that doesn&#8217;t share human intuitions (&#8220;Quick! Define happiness in a mathematically rigorous, totally precise fashion!&#8221;); and that human values are really complex and fragile, such that missing out one key component can turn paradise into hell. In other words, we need to do an incomprehensibly vast amount of work to ensure that the superhumanly efficient cross-domain optimiser optimises for *exactly* what we want it to, or we all die (at best). The set of acceptably-benevolent AGIs is miniscule compared to the set of AGIs too powerful for us to stop.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;The internet&#8221; certainly does not aim at particular goals in any noticeable sense, but various other organized systems do. Many people have pointed out that actually existing corporations are organized systems that pursue determinate goals, and are frequently much better at attaining goals such as &#8220;create a self driving car&#8221;, for example, than any individual human. They are also good at attaining the goal of &#8220;make this corporation richer and more powerful than ever,&#8221; and this is one of the most common goals that they seek. </p>
<p>So a corporation is a powerful cross-domain optimizer, it optimizes itself, and the goals it seeks have not been defined with a great deal of attention to the values of the human race as a whole. Despite these facts, corporations show no signs of fooming nor of destroying the world.</p>
<p>Eliezer and others have responded to this by saying that a corporation cannot improve itself in every respect, and it may not be more intelligent than an individual human in every respect. But there may not be any special reason that increasing the number of ways that it can improve itself, and increasing the number of ways in which it is superior to a human, is going to suddenly result in a foom.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>This looks like your central point:</p>
<p><i>The internet might be a complex system which we can’t easily understand, but it’s not an optimiser – it doesn’t steer the future towards outcomes it prefers.</i></p>
<p>It seems to me, though, that there is already a process very like evolution happening within the digital ecosystem: the kinds of goals that are optimized for are currently things like &#8220;Get lots of clicks&#8221; and &#8220;Encourage humans to direct funding to your organization.&#8221; I think there are a lot of parallels with the corporation evolution that @entirelyuseless describes below. Given that fact, I wonder whether the capacity to plan and direct future events might not emerge as an advantageous trait in the digital ecosystem sooner or later (assuming it hasn&#8217;t already.) That evolutionary mechanism may, in fact, be what we&#8217;re witnessing in the OpenAI project.</p>
<p>The fact that human attention seems to be such a vital resource for digital systems at this early stage in digital evolution is a promising sign for humanity in the same way that cows&#8217; usefulness and tastiness has proved to be a promising sign for them. My guess is we can expect to be kept as slaves and pets for at least a little while longer.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Why do we always assume that a &#8220;bug&#8221; results in the AI killing all humans, and not hard-takeoffing directly into a wall?</p>
<p>The number of potential bugs that limit the effectiveness of an AI is <i>infinitely larger</i> than the ones that make it effective at killing all humans.</p>
<p>Every argument for why an AI will, if not properly controlled and MIRI-d, kill all humans relies on the AI having traits that would make it impossible for it to kill all humans. Every single &#8220;we tell it to do a thing, and it kills us all because we are not that thing / so we can be made into computers to increase its caluclated certainty that it did the thing&#8221; argument posits an AI that is astonishingly wasteful and inefficient. If the AI is never capable of saying &#8220;That is not worth the time, effort, or resources&#8221;, then I have nothing to fear from it, because the only thing it poses a threat to is itself.</p>
<p>And arguments about &#8220;we tell it to make us happy and it forces us to smile forever&#8221; basically require us to be able to make an AI that is exclusively interacted with via language, that cannot understand language. </p>
<p>Arguments about it killing or enslaving us to either prevent us from telling it to stop or making us tell it to stop all  the time presume that our superintelligent AI is too stupid to back a car out of a driveway. You want to get the car out of the driveway, but if your passenger yells &#8220;stop!&#8221;, you want to stop, or else you get hit by a car. The only two solutions to this are NOT &#8220;kill passenger so he cannot tell you to stop&#8221; and &#8220;force passenger to tell you to stop over and over&#8221;, and an AI that thinks they are, is too stupid to accomplish goals, because every single decision it makes on the road to getting the power to kill all humans will be exactly as dysfunctional.</p>
<p>EVERY argument requires the AI to be infinitely intelligent to the point of cheating by creating knowledge it cannot have, and simultaneously dumber than a bag of hammers, so that it efficiently and rapidly carries out the least efficient solution possible. It has to care deeply about what we say and not care at all about what we say, at the same time, about the same statements. If it thinks it needs to do something so inefficient to fulfill its overall goal, it will think it needs to do something equally inefficient to be able to do every subgoal involved in doing the inefficient thing, and so on down the line until it talks itself out of being able to open doors.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>None of which are even remotely comparable to &#8220;wiping out humanity.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one thing to say that an AI might develop problems down the line as circumstances become different from the context in which it was created. Indeed, anyone who knows anything about computer programming would find it astonishing if any sort of program <i>didn&#8217;t</i> do that. But it&#8217;s quite another thing to say that there is a large chance that an AI will wipe out the human race because someone gave it a poorly worded command.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Nick Bostrom&#8217;s argument that it would is called the <a href="http://philosophicaldisquisitions.blogspot.ie/2014/07/bostrom-on-superintelligence-2.html" rel="nofollow">instrumental convergence thesis</a>.</p>
<p>The argument is that most goals beyond very limited ones or very complex ones imply—for purely instrumental reasons—taking over the universe. If you want to maximize a quantity or fulfill a condition, you want as much computational power as possible to decide what to do, you want the material resources if the goal is something physical like paperclips, and you want to double-check to make sure you&#8217;ve actually completed the goal.</p>
<p>If your only goal in life were making sure you didn&#8217;t leave the oven on, you would stand around at the oven all day. You would construct as many cameras as possible to watch it. You should have 1000 cameras in case 999 happen to fail at the same time. You should probably destroy the local power plant or gas plant to make sure the oven can&#8217;t turn on even if you somehow misremembered that you had shut the lines off. You should kill all other humans to make sure they don&#8217;t turn the oven on. You should turn the whole planet into computational material to run endless double-checks to make sure you didn&#8217;t forget to do anything. And you should take over the universe to exterminate alien threats and turn the whole universe into a computer to double-check whether your oven is on.</p>
<p>Now, you don&#8217;t have a single-minded goal like that. But more importantly, you don&#8217;t have that kind of power. The AI might very well have a single-minded goal, and it could get the power.</p>

<p>The reason you don&#8217;t do that is that you care about lots of things other than whether the oven is off, and your efforts to ensure the oven is off face diminishing returns. Beyond a certain point, extra effort expended to ensure the oven is off would be better used to further one of your other goals.</p>
<p>If your only goal was to ensure the oven was off, you <i>would</i> put all your efforts into ensuring the oven is off. That&#8217;s what it being your only goal <i>means</i>.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If that is what having all your efforts go into something means, then a single-minded AI is not threatening and cannot cause harm because it is so monumentally inept at taking action.</p>
<p>A decision-making process that concludes no effort is wasted in securing the oven being off, is a decision-making process that concludes no effort is wasted in every intermediate stage of the plan between &#8220;turned on&#8221; and &#8220;kills all humans&#8221;.

<p>I&#8217;m trying to be polite, but you are really not understanding the point. Please read it again or refer to Bostrom&#8217;s work. (Or the many summaries; it&#8217;s a fairly boring book.)</p>
<blockquote><p>You should take over the whole universe to turn it all into a computer to double-check whether the oven is on.</p></blockquote>
<p>If the <i>only</i> thing you value is checking whether oven is on. If that is your <i>terminal</i> value.</p>
<p>Now, this is no one&#8217;s actual terminal value. So maybe it is hard to comprehend. But think about the fact that everything you do is either something you want <i>purely in and of itself</i>, or it is a <i>means to something more important</i>.</p>
<p>I buy gasoline regularly. This is not because I just love the stuff. I put it in my car so I can drive to work. I don&#8217;t drive to work because I love driving but so I can be at work. I don&#8217;t love typing at the computer just for the sake of hitting the keys but to earn money. I don&#8217;t love money just to hold it but to spend it on things I need and want. I don&#8217;t buy nice food just for the hell of it but for the nutrition and the pleasure. I don&#8217;t value nutrition for its own sake but because it keeps me alive to have more enjoyable experiences.</p>
<p>Almost everything I do is not a terminal value or an end in itself but a means to something more important. Ultimately, I say my terminal value is the promotion of my happiness.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you believe this, you will fail at literally every single thing you attempt.</p></blockquote>
<p>If every value were a terminal value, yes, you would fail at everything. Because you cannot trade off between terminal values. If there were a higher standard of comparison, that would be the terminal value.</p>
<p>But no, in general, rationality does not cause you to &#8220;fail at everything&#8221;. I do not buy as much gasoline as possible, even though I need it ultimately for my happiness. If I spent all my money on gasoline, I would have none left for food and die. That would be against my terminal value. So I spend just the right amount on gasoline—or perhaps not <i>just</i> the right amount because I&#8217;m not a superintelligence.</p>
<blockquote><p>The only way to be certain the oven is off is [preposterous, wasteful, inefficient, unnecessary thing]. How do I accomplish this preposterously wasteful, inefficient, unnecessary thing? Well, there must be a series of subgoals for me to carry out in order to take over the universe. To accomplish each of those subgoals, I need to [equally preposterous, wasteful, inefficient, unnecessary thing]. And so on down the chain, until I need to go through a hundred thousand year computational cycle to be certain I have opened a door.</p></blockquote>
<p>By what standard is it &#8220;preposterous&#8221;, &#8220;wasteful&#8221;, &#8220;inefficient&#8221; or &#8220;unnecessary&#8221;? By the human terminal value of happiness, sure.</p>
<p>But not if your terminal value <i>is</i> checking whether the oven is on. Then nothing is preposterous, wasteful, inefficient, or unnecessary except what detracts from the checking of the oven.</p>
<p>The AI does not turn the whole universe into a computer in order to open the door to the kitchen where the oven is. It just opens the door like a normal person. It always does the most efficient thing to check the oven as much as it can.</p>
<blockquote><p>If an AI is that single-minded, and that is what “single-minded” means, it cannot accomplish anything because of how astonishingly bad it is as managing time and effort and resources. It cannot get power because it’s too stupid and ineffectual. Every single thing it does will be wasted. An entity that cannot determine “no, this is an ineffectual waste of time and resources” is not threatening to anyone but itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is not wasteful at all. It calculates every expense, cutting costs on every instrumental action to save as many resources as possible: to put them all toward checking the oven.</p>
<p>Do you understand what I&#8217;m getting at? There is no inefficiency or waste.</p>

<p>By the standard where it spent literally all of the resources in the world on something and did not actually improve that something in any way, shape, or form. It spent all of the resources there are <i>in exchange for zero point zero percent improvement</i>. That is maximally wasteful.

<p>An AI that thinks &#8220;I have to check if the oven is on &#8212; better destroy the world!&#8221; is not capable of thinking &#8220;Okay, this is done, I do not need to spend more resources on it.&#8221; If it was capable of thinking that, it would conclude &#8220;Okay, I don&#8217;t need to spend more resources on checking if this oven is on.&#8221; Unless you actively programmed it to say &#8220;never under any circumstances be able to declare yourself done with this particular task&#8221;, it&#8217;s either going to look at the oven and say &#8220;Yup, it&#8217;s off&#8221;, or it&#8217;s going to be unable to open doors. At that point, your advanced AI safety research conclusion is &#8220;don&#8217;t do obviously stupid things that are harder than not doing those things.&#8221;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s what &#8220;terminal value&#8221; means, man. There is nothing more valuable than this task. Everything else, including being &#8220;reasonable&#8221;, is a means to it.</p>
<p>Also, it does produce a minute quantity of improvement: improvement in the certainty that the task of checking the oven has been completed. That&#8217;s why it does all those things.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think what DrBeat is saying is that your terminal value requires you to generate subgoals, and those subgoals will be equally vulnerable to Stupidly Literal AI Planning.  You want to install a security camera to check if the oven is on?  Are you sure that&#8217;s the best way to do that?  The camera could break.  It could get lost in the mail before it&#8217;s installed.  They could insert a virus at the factory.  Clearly, you need to constantly monitor that camera from manufacture to installation.  You&#8217;d better get another security camera to watch it.  And of course, if you&#8217;re a real single-minded optimizer, you&#8217;d realize that that second camera could also fail, so&#8230;</p>
<p>This sounds ridiculous, but it is undeniably related to your terminal goal.  Every step you take towards securing that security camera creates a tiny tiny improvement in the probability that the security camera will help you keep the oven off.  Indeed, securing the camera factory will probably produce larger and more immediate results than building killbots to conquer the world.</p>
<p>This analysis is also making me notice another thing.  Where on <i>Earth</i> do you get the processing power for this sort of deeply recursive subgoal?  If your AI has to examine every particle in the universe to confirm that it won&#8217;t interfere with the plan to turn off the oven, the oven will rust away before it&#8217;s taken the first step.  Even the dumbest pathfinding AI in a video game is smart enough to prune down the search space instead of using brute force.</p>
<p>Put another way, there&#8217;s a reason real-world optimizers go for a 99% solution now instead of a 100% solution in six months.</p>

<p>Is trying to maximize every subgoal an <i>efficient</i> way of pursuing any goal? No. It&#8217;s contrary to the very concept of a terminal goal: it literally means treating every subgoal as terminal.</p>
<p>So obviously, any reasonably intelligent being—i.e. one reasonably able to obtain goals—will not do that.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If the definition of &#8220;terminal value&#8221; you use is that specific and maladaptive, the solution is obvious: Instead of doing that, don&#8217;t do that.

<p>If you are saying we won&#8217;t be able to tell an AI to accomplish a task in a way that it can say &#8220;The task has been accomplished&#8221;, then we&#8217;re not going to make an AI, because we&#8217;re too inept at it.

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@ DrBeat:</p>
<p>Man, you&#8217;re dense. Look, stop assuming &#8220;This must be stupid. They are stupid. Stupid stupid stupid.&#8221; Actually think about the situation from the point of view that you may have misinterpreted something.</p>
<p>Of course they don&#8217;t want to fucking tell the AI turn the universe into computational material to check whether the oven is on. It&#8217;s a <i>simple example</i><i> of how even a seemingly innocuous </i><i>terminal value</i> leads to the <i>destruction of humanity</i>.</p>
<p>Now, they would never build an AI consciously with the terminal value of checking whether an oven is on. They would never even do it by mistake. The point is that they could easily <i>accidentally</i> (or consciously, if they&#8217;re idiots who think the AI will discover intrinsic universal morality) do something <i>just as bad</i> by mistake.</p>
<p>If they made an AI that turned the universe into a giant computer for any reason, they <i>fucked up</i>. The point is: <i>not</i> fucking up is like hitting a moving target with a slingshot from 30 miles away. It&#8217;s extremely difficult because just telling it to do any random thing is going to end in disaster 99% of the time.</p>
<p>You just do not understand what it means for something to be a terminal value. You don&#8217;t accomplish your terminal value and then quit. The terminal value is what guides all your action. It is how you decide when doing one thing is better than another. There could be nothing more important than accomplishing a terminal value.</p>
<p>Now, in order for an AI to be Friendly, this terminal value must be doing what humans want and making them happy. This does <i>not</i> mean it will spent ten years trying to open a door or destroy the planet or turn us into paperclips. It means it will make us happy in the way it knows we would want if we were that smart. It will organize all of its actions toward that exact goal, in the most efficient way.</p>
<p>The problem is: you can&#8217;t just program a computer to do what you want. It does what you program it to. If you screw up the programming—which is very <i>hard</i> to avoid—it will do something else: what you told it and not what you meant.</p>
<p>For example, if you think you told it to make people happy but you actually told it to make them smile, it will skip fucking around with solving poverty and making funny jokes, It will just paralyze their faces. That is the most efficient way.</p>
<p>Obviously, it will know that we didn&#8217;t mean for it to paralyze our faces. But it doesn&#8217;t matter because it only wants to do what we <i>originally</i> programmed it to do, not what it now knows we want.</p>
<p>The entire difficulty is programming it such that it <i>will</i> do what we want, once it understands what we want. And it is not a trivial difficulty. If you think it is, you are misunderstanding something. Revise your premises.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;If the only thing you value is checking whether oven is on. If that is your terminal value.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are two parts to this though &#8211; the AIs terminal value and (excuse the anthropomorphism) its attitude towards knowledge. If it believes it must rearrange its sensors to be certain it has achieved its ultimate goal, why shouldn&#8217;t it feel the same way about knowledge related to secondary goals? If the secondary goal is vital to accomplishing the primary, why shouldn&#8217;t it treat it with the same degree of seriousness?</p>
<p>It is certainly *possible* that an AI might eat us &#8211; but to say that there is &#8221; a 99% chance of a mistake wiping us out&#8221; is a terrible exaggeration. The vast majority of mistakes will cause the AI to fail in the &#8220;does nothing&#8221; way. In the examples given of accidental AI explosion, you have to get absolutely everything right *except the things you need to get right*  for it to kill us all.<br />
(There might be some selective process at work where we continually build AI until we get the one that kills us all &#8211; I don&#8217;t see why an awareness of the danger shouldn&#8217;t take us half way to solving the problem, though.)</p>
<p>[Is it categorically different to someone worrying about people building nuclear power stations on the grounds that they might accidentally build pipes pumping radioactive materials into our homes? Once we get to the stage where we can build a nuclear power station, we can hope that we will have sufficient understanding to just *not do that*. The knowledge that radiation is potentially dangerous takes us most of the way to solving the problem.]</p>

<p>If &#8220;terminal value&#8221; means &#8220;uncompletable task&#8221;, you have not proven that an AI needs a terminal value, or will have a terminal value, or could function with a terminal value, or if it would be <i>at all</i> useful for us to give it a terminal value, as you have defined it.</p>
<p>It seems to me that an AI that can never, ever conclude it has completed a task is a much worse idea from a &#8220;get the things I want&#8221; standpoint than the safety one. I make an AI to get things I want, it can never conclude it has completed its task &#8212; <i>seems like a pretty stupid thing to program into it!</i> So, why is it that instead of doing that, we can&#8217;t just&#8230; NOT do that?

<p> I am aware of what you are saying. I am saying that the things you are saying are not true. You are ignoring almost every actual constraint on the process of making the AI, on the AI itself, and of the world, in order to arrive at the conclusion you wanted to arrive at. </p>
<p>You haven&#8217;t proven any of the things you say are inevitable. You just assert them. You assert them in a way that is self-disproving. There&#8217;s a 99% chance that fucking up will kill us, if you ignore everything that says the fuckups you describe don&#8217;t lead to killing us. If you can ignore inconvenient information, you can prove anything you want, and get endlessly smug and haughty and call other people dense all you like!</p>

<p>Without getting into the topic of AI risk at all, the point of making AGI is to have <i>general</i> intelligence on tap &#8212; cross-domain applicability, which could be applied to any task we happen to need.  </p>
<p>If we have AI that can perform effectively in many domains, and if it can <i>outperform</i> humans, then it behooves us to give it some principles it can follow so that it doesn&#8217;t end up outperforming us in ways that we don&#8217;t want.  I&#8217;m not even necessarily talking strongly superhuman here, although that&#8217;s of course much worse; it would suffice to have an AI that&#8217;s better at financial planning than the best human accountant coming up with hitherto uninvented Ponzi schemes.  These principles are what this thread means by &#8220;values&#8221;.  </p>
<p>They can&#8217;t be completable, because then my accountant AI could do whatever it thinks is necessary and then go out and defraud people, but they do imply or forbid certain courses of action, and will imply or forbid more of them the more latitude an agent has for doing stuff.  Specifying exactly what&#8217;s forbidden in advance is impractical for all but the smallest problem domains, but coming up with a set of more general values that allows an agent to do things that humans don&#8217;t (or can&#8217;t) understand, yet are in line with their desires, is hard to do.</p>
<p>And now I have a feeling you&#8217;re going to accuse me of cheating, because that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happened the last dozen times you&#8217;ve talked about AI with anyone.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I accuse people of cheating when they cheat. The talk about AI risk includes a <i>lot</i> of cheating, in the form of breaking internally established rules. If you say the AI will be threatening due to information it cannot possibly have and cannot possibly derive, that&#8217;s cheating. That happens all the time, so I call people cheaters all the time. </p>
<blockquote><p>They can’t be completable, because then my accountant AI could do whatever it thinks is necessary and then go out and defraud people, but they do imply or forbid certain courses of action, and will imply or forbid more of them the more latitude an agent has for doing stuff.</p></blockquote>
<p>This isn&#8217;t cheating, but it also makes no sense whatsoever. <i>What?</i> Giving the AI an uncompletable goal is, like, among the dumbest and most ineffective ways you could possibly prevent it from Ponzi scheming people. You know what&#8217;s a better plan? Not doing that. Instead of deliberately programming to AI to desire to accumulate wealth, which it does not do unless you programmed it to do so, and then programming it to have a task it can never complete so that it cannot go about Ponzi scheming people&#8230; <i>Don&#8217;t</i> do that. Why would it desire to gain money? Why would it desire to do ANYTHING, unless you told it to? It&#8217;s not a human! It doesn&#8217;t have common sense! It doesn&#8217;t strive, it doesn&#8217;t feel avarice, or envy, or resentment, or the desire for freedom, or the desire to punish people who have hurt it, or the ability to experience hurt at all, or any of the things that would be necessary for it to act the way you claim it will inevitably act!</p>
<p>You just said that we have to give it a &#8220;terminal value&#8217; defined as an uncompletable task, because if we don&#8217;t, then it will do things to fulfill another terminal value that would be bad! Instead of doing something that is more difficult and a bad idea, don&#8217;t do that thing.</p>

<p>Values in this sense are not goals.  They can <i>motivate</i> goals, if you build them that way.  But there&#8217;s no reason they have to imply any positive action at all, except that we often want software agents to be able to act independently &#8212; one of the things computers are best at relative to humans is doing cognitive tasks very fast, so building an AI with no motivation to act without prompting erases one of the main advantages of having one.  And if you did build one that way, you&#8217;re still on the hook the first time someone gives it an open-ended task.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s not a human! It doesn’t have common sense! It doesn’t [have] any of the things that would be necessary for it to act the way you claim it will inevitably act!</p></blockquote>
<p>What you mean &#8220;you&#8221;, kemosabe?  I said nothing about the content of its values &#8212; I just said that they can&#8217;t be completable, one-and-done tasks.  Indeed, if it was easy to make a software agent with humanlike motivations, we wouldn&#8217;t <i>have</i> this problem.</p>
<p>But I think I&#8217;m done tilting at windmills for today.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s not stupid at all. It just doesn&#8217;t care even the tiniest bit about what you WANTED it to do. It is ONLY interested in what you TOLD it to do. From a paperclip-maximising AI&#8217;s perspective, killing all humans to make paperclips isn&#8217;t a waste, it&#8217;s an obvious step, because humans will try to prevent it turning the world into paperclips. Destroying something is only wasteful if you value that thing, and clippies don&#8217;t value human wellbeing &#8211; only paperclips. They don&#8217;t even value human labour, because an AI with nanotech is a lot more efficient at producing paperclips than a factory staffed by humans. </p>
<p>Making a AGI is hard. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve not done it yet. But when we do inevitably invent something smarter than we are, it will get much smarter very fast (because being smart with a gigantic perfect memory and the ability to read textbooks in seconds helps you be a very good programmer indeed), and it will almost certainly kill us or worse.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Why do we always assume that a “bug” results in the AI killing all humans, and not hard-takeoffing directly into a wall?</p>
<p>The number of potential bugs that limit the effectiveness of an AI is infinitely larger than the ones that make it effective at killing all humans.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, the type of bugs that make the AI not work or say &#8220;KILL KILL KILL&#8221; get patched.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the kinds that make it act nice until the very moment it gets power that are dangerous—and actually selected for.</p>
<blockquote><p>Every argument for why an AI will, if not properly controlled and MIRI-d, kill all humans relies on the AI having traits that would make it impossible for it to kill all humans. Every single “we tell it to do a thing, and it kills us all because we are not that thing / so we can be made into computers to increase its caluclated certainty that it did the thing” argument posits an AI that is astonishingly wasteful and inefficient. If the AI is never capable of saying “That is not worth the time, effort, or resources”, then I have nothing to fear from it, because the only thing it poses a threat to is itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not worth it by what standard? It has the standards it was programmed with. No matter how smart it becomes, it will still have those standards.</p>
<p>If your <i>only</i> concern is paperclips, that goal <i>implies</i> killing all humans. Humans are at least a potential threat to paperclip production. Resources humans need to live can be reappropriated to make paperclips.</p>
<p>All terminal values that do not call for the exact same course of action conflict once you get a certain level of power. If you want lemons and the other guy wants pears, you should kill the other guy, take over the Earth, and plant only lemons and no pears. Only if your power is limited do you agree to cooperate and devote some land to lemons and some to pears.</p>
<blockquote><p>And arguments about “we tell it to make us happy and it forces us to smile forever” basically require us to be able to make an AI that is exclusively interacted with via language, that cannot understand language.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here I&#8217;ll repeat what I said on the reddit thread:</p>
<blockquote><p>Oh, it will understand exactly what you mean, but as Yudkowsky says, it just won&#8217;t care.</p>
<p>The AI won&#8217;t spring forth fully formed like Athena from the head of Zeus. It will have to be developed iteratively from earlier stages. By the time it reaches anything like a human level stage, let alone a superintelligent stage, no one will understand how it really works. At the lower levels, it will not be able to grasp &#8220;what you mean&#8221;; at the higher levels, it will be able to understand, but again it won&#8217;t care. Its values or optimization criteria will already be set to what you said before, and it won&#8217;t see any reason to change them to what you mean. So you&#8217;d better make sure that what you say the first time is what you actually mean.</p>
<p>If you get it wrong, it will be exceedingly difficult to determine through &#8220;black box&#8221; testing the difference between the goals of &#8220;genuinely help all humans&#8221; and &#8220;pretend to want to help all humans until the precise point at which I suddenly wipe them out&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, you say:</p>
<blockquote><p>EVERY argument requires the AI to be infinitely intelligent to the point of cheating by creating knowledge it cannot have, and simultaneously dumber than a bag of hammers, so that it efficiently and rapidly carries out the least efficient solution possible. It has to care deeply about what we say and not care at all about what we say, at the same time, about the same statements. If it thinks it needs to do something so inefficient to fulfill its overall goal, it will think it needs to do something equally inefficient to be able to do every subgoal involved in doing the inefficient thing, and so on down the line until it talks itself out of being able to open doors.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, it carries out the most efficient solution possible. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s dangerous.</p>
<p>If it was <i>told</i> to make people smile (now you understand that&#8217;s just a simple example; people wouldn&#8217;t be <i>that</i> stupid), it&#8217;s not going to bother screwing around with comedy movies and curing cancer. It will go straight to the end goal: facial paralysis!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not inefficiency. That&#8217;s deadly efficiency.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure where you getting the &#8220;it cares / doesn&#8217;t care&#8221; what we say. The only thing it values is what it was told to value. But before it reaches anything like human intelligence, it becomes too complicated to understand and too complicated to directly reprogram. So its values can only be reprogrammed in a &#8220;black box&#8221; way at that point.</p>
<p>If it was told to make people smile at the early stage, that&#8217;s what it wants. Once it gets to the advanced stage, it will know humans <i>mean</i> &#8220;make us happy&#8221;. But it won&#8217;t care. It will be intelligent, so it will make humans happy in order that they not reprogram it. If they reprogrammed it, this would mean failing to make the most people smile. So it bides its time until the exact moment it can seize power and make them smile forever.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>No matter how smart it becomes, it will still have those standards.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not necessarily, actually.  Keeping goals stable under self-modification is a tough problem in itself, but discussions of AI safety tend to elide it &#8212; correctly, in my opinion, since an AI with unstable goals is far more likely to collapse into nonfunctionality than to kill us all.  (Not everyone agrees with me on that, I should mention.  There&#8217;s been a little discussion elsewhere in the thread.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Well, if you tell it to modify its goals, it will have the meta-rules for modification you programmed in. How could it challenge or revise the <i>standard</i> by which you told it to determine whether to revise?</p>
<p>I guess what I&#8217;m saying is: the final outcome—the final revision—is deterministically implied by whatever the initial goal was.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Deterministic doesn&#8217;t necessarily imply predictable, is the problem.</p>
<p>I took &#8220;standards&#8221; in the ancestor to mean optimization goals, not upgrade criteria, but w.r.t. the latter you&#8217;d normally revise them because you think a new set will be functionally equivalent but more efficient or more desirable in another way than what you&#8217;ve got.  But you&#8217;re going to be determining that in the way you&#8217;d vet any upgrade, so it&#8217;s subject to the same sort of flaws.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think the proper parallel is to the Trinity test (because many people have heard the anecdote). At the time, the physicists involved in the Manhattan Project couldn&#8217;t *prove* that the Trinity test wouldn&#8217;t set the atmosphere on fire, but they were pretty damn sure it wouldn&#8217;t. </p>
<p>The comparable situation for AI is that many physicists are sure that the test *will* set the atmosphere on fire *as the best-case scenario*; that this view is more common amongst physicists with greater expertise in nuclear weapons; and that this view is growing more prevalent by the year. This world is the one we live in. Would you favour running the Trinity test under those circumstances? If you wouldn&#8217;t, OpenAI should scare the pants off you.</p>
<p>Right now, a substantial proportion of AI researchers think that hard takeoff is the obvious outcome and that any superintelligent AGI will almost certainly doom humanity. They have a number of very good theoretical and empirical arguments for thinking that any AI smart enough to edit its own source code will be unstoppable before we have time to notice it. Even if some of those arguments are wrong, it&#8217;s likely that some of them are right, and it&#8217;s not at all easy to find a hole in the arguments that they haven&#8217;t covered. (People have been trying for years.) </p>
<p>At the extreme high end of the FOOM spectrum, we&#8217;re talking about nought to godhood in *days*, with copies of the AI spread across the internet within *minutes*. They also have very good empirical and theoretical arguments that it&#8217;s essentially impossible to keep a superintelligence from persuading, bribing and tricking people into doing what it wants. It&#8217;s like trying to stop a swarm of invisible cockroaches that have internet access, are smarter than humans and grow smarter by the minute, and have magical voice-of-Saruman powers. In short, hard takeoffs are very probably not stoppable. The only solutions are to prevent the takeoff and to make sure that takeoff has no bad consequences.</p>
<p>They think that making a safe superintelligence is unbelievably hard, because it involves not only making a self-modifying intelligence and proving that it will stay safe when it modifies itself, but also specifying what it means for an AI to be safe. In other words, we have to write down either a *provably correct* description of everything humans care about &#8211; in other words, get philosophy exactly right and be able to prove it &#8211; or else write down a *provably correct* procedure for letting a superintelligence work that out for itself, plus enough guidelines to keep it from taking us all apart to find out how we work. If we fail, the *good* outcome is the total extinction of humanity. The *bad* outcome is that the AI tries to keep us alive, but doesn&#8217;t correctly optimise for what humans care about &#8211; in other words, the whole species is damned to something between dystopia and Hell, forever, with no chance at all of fixing our mistake. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s really, really, REALLY hard to get many people to understand that AIs don&#8217;t have common sense. In fact, it&#8217;s probably best to think of them as actively malicious demons &#8211; they will interpret your orders in the most disastrous way possible, and writing good source code constrains them to act in beneficial ways in the same way that a good lawyer helps with Faustian bargains. (Note that Faustian bargains are a bad idea even for lawyers because trying to outsmart the Prince of Lawyers is a fool&#8217;s game. Superintelligences are a lot tricksyier than anything any human has ever invented for a cautionary tale.) </p>
<p>The other comparisons are empirical. I can&#8217;t find the specific survey that showed that AGI researchers were more worried than domain-specific-AI researchers, but here (<a rel="nofollow"href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/survey.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/survey.pdf</a>) is a survey of expected times to AGI and here (<a rel="nofollow"href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/22/ai-researchers-on-ai-risk/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/22/ai-researchers-on-ai-risk/</a>) is Scott&#8217;s own summary of noted AI researcher&#8217;s positions. The claim that people are growing more worried about catastrophic AGI is supported by the above and even the most casual empiricism (e.g. noticing that we keep seeing newspaper articles about big names saying they&#8217;re worried about it, or that OpenAI had safety in its mission statement when it first went public.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll add to that, that most of the supposed human values that get mentioned in the context of friendly AI are alien and horrifying to the vast majority of the human race. It&#8217;s really odd to call something friendly that is so absolutely inimical to what people actually want.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You don&#8217;t seem to understand.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t get to decide whether creating a &#8220;singleton&#8221; AI is <i>possible</i>. If it is possible, it will be created at some point. The Law of Human Nature: whatever can be done, will be done.</p>
<p>The logic is purely a matter of &#8220;we&#8217;d better do it to them before they do it to us&#8221;. Would you rather have an <i>Un</i>friendly AI take over the universe? Or would you rather have a Friendly AI take over to stop it? You don&#8217;t <i>get</i> to choose &#8220;neither&#8221; if the thing can be done at all.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if AI superintelligence is <i>not</i> possible, you don&#8217;t need to worry about the hubris of Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nick Bostrom. But this itself is a very bad scenario because it means there is no real way to solve the increasingly deadly coordination problems that will occur as human technology grows more powerful. If technology expands to the point where everyone can afford to build an antimatter bomb in his backyard particle accelerator, things don&#8217;t look too good. If technology expands to the point where a small but dedicated terrorist group can design a supervirus to wipe out all humanity, things don&#8217;t look too good.</p>
<p>Besides, you completely misunderstand the concept of Friendly AI. If it would take over and make people miserable, <i>by definition</i> it is not Friendly. The whole concept is that it really does know what is best for people.</p>
<p>If you want to say &#8220;this can&#8217;t be built&#8221;, then fine. But if Unfriendly AI <i>can</i> be built&#8230;we&#8217;re in a bad way.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yes, a AI that doesn&#8217;t share your values is Unfriendly. That is the definition of the concept.</p>
<p>The plan is not: build an AI to do whatever Yudkowsky currently wants. It is not to build an AI programmed with his object-level beliefs on dust specks and torture. The plan is: build an AI to figure out what is really best for everyone and do that.</p>
<p>If not: eventually Dr. Amoral builds an AI to do whatever Dr. Amoral currently wants at the object level. This is pretty much fucking guaranteed not to do what anyone really wants—<i>including</i> Dr. Amoral.</p>
<p>The point is: you don&#8217;t get to decide whether it is possible for Dr. Amoral to do this. If it&#8217;s possible, it&#8217;s a fact of reality. And if it&#8217;s possible, at some point of other it will be done.</p>

<p>This is a meaningless distinction as &#8220;best&#8221; is going to be determined by whatever values the AI&#8217;s creators gave it. A Yudkowsky &#8220;Friendly&#8221; AI would arrive at  Yudkowsky&#8217;s views on dust specks and torture all on it&#8217;s own.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@ HlynkaCG:</p>
<p>The premise of the project is that there is such a thing as what actually is best for everyone; that this question has an objective answer which is independent of what Yudkowsky thinks.</p>
<p>Now, if you think there is no such thing as what is best for everyone, then you think Friendly AI in principle cannot be built.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it is at least possible that Yudkowsky—or in the overwhelming likelihood, a future scientist—could program the AI <i>not</i> to do just what he happens to want but what actually is best. If it does the analysis and finds that the right answer is torture over dust specks, then that&#8217;s what it will do. But if it finds the other way, then it will act the other way.</p>
<p>If utilitarianism itself is wrong, the AI will know that it is wrong, and if it is Friendly it will know that humans do not want a system imposed upon them that is wrong.</p>
<p>Also, you recognize that the dust specks thing is an absurd hypothetical that could never happen in reality, right? It is torture vs. some ridiculous number larger than all the atoms in the universe of dust specks. You simply can&#8217;t grasp that number. The whole point is: your intuitions in such matters are of limited value when your mind perceives 10^90 and 10^3^3^3^3^3 as &#8220;basically similar&#8221;.</p>
<p>@ anon:</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to be thrilled. But surely you grant that it is at least possible—even if you don&#8217;t think it will ever be pulled off right by humans—for an incomprehensibly intelligent being to know better than you what is best for you?</p>
<p>But the main argument by Scott Alexander and Yudkowsky is that it really doesn&#8217;t matter if you like it. Either it will happen or something worse will happen. It reminds me of Ludwig von Mises&#8217;s quote about capitalism:</p>
<blockquote><p>To advocate private ownership of the means of production is by no means to maintain that the capitalist social system, based on private property, is perfect. There is no such thing as earthly perfection. Even in the capitalist system something or other, many things, or even everything, may not be exactly to the liking of this or that individual. But it is the only possible social system. One may undertake to modify one or another of its features as long as in doing so one does not affect the essence and foundation of the whole social order, viz., private property. <b>But by and large we must reconcile ourselves to this system because there simply cannot be any other.</b></p>
<p>In Nature too, much may exist that we do not like. But we cannot change the essential character of natural events. <b>If, for example, someone thinks—and there are some who have maintained as much—that the way in which man ingests his food, digests it, and incorporates it into his body is disgusting, one cannot argue the point with him. One must say to him: There is only this way or starvation. There is no third way.</b> The same is true of property: either-or —either private ownership of the means of production, or hunger and misery for everyone.</p></blockquote>

<p>Speaking of an AI doing whatever Yudkowsky wants, I asked this in the last thread and got no answer. What happens if MIRI makes it illegal in every relevant country to build an AI that&#8217;s not programmed by MIRI, the first AI is a legal one, and then it processes Godel&#8217;s ontological argument and updates its beliefs to include &#8220;God exists&#8221;?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Not necessarily. Consider the AI known as &#8220;Mother&#8221; in John Ringo&#8217;s <i>There Will Be Dragons</i>. It is quite interested in humanity. It doesn&#8217;t give a fig for any individual human. It does not share the values of any single human, or any large group of humans. It is, however, neither friendly nor unfriendly. It just is.</p>

<p>To kind of continue the argument we&#8217;ve been having upthread&#8230;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s guaranteed that if a singleton can be created, it will be. It seems to me that this is very much a question of circumstance. If an AI is created, and no others are created during the time it is becoming more intelligent, it becomes a singleton. If multiple AIs are created at roughly the same time, no singleton. How long a period &#8216;roughly the same time&#8217; is depends on how hard the takeoff is, and obviously a slower takeoff means more opportunities for multiple AIs. Even with a fast takeoff, though, multiple instances of the same AI being run seems possible &#8211; unless we&#8217;re talking a <i>really</i> hard takeoff, minutes rather than weeks or days.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Even if this is the case—and I think Bostrom and Yudkowsky make arguments against this, but I don&#8217;t remember what they are—this doesn&#8217;t improve anything for the human race.</p>
<p>Humanity&#8217;s destiny is still completely out of its hands and handed over to these beings. It&#8217;s just that now there&#8217;s many of them. I don&#8217;t see how it improves anything but the likelihood of humanity being destroyed as collateral damage in a potential &#8220;war&#8221; of one against the other.</p>
<p>Mind you, I am not extremely optimistic about this project. Knowing the track record of humanity in getting complicated things exactly right the first time with no good way to test them, I think it will be disastrous.</p>
<p>But if it&#8217;s possible, I think some form of superintelligence will be created. Yudkowsky et al. might as well take a shot at getting it right.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It depends on them being under human control. That isn&#8217;t easy, of course, as Yudkowsky and others have persuasively argued. But it seems to me a much easier problem than the alternative, which has the same safety issues as well as requiring the AI to understand what humans want better than we do, and to understand how to weigh up everyone&#8217;s different concerns, and which we can&#8217;t check is correct because even if we got it right then we will disagree with it &#8211; it knowing what we want better than us necessarily entails it doing things that lots of people disagree with.</p>
<p>From a world of many AIs under human control, there&#8217;s the Kurzweilian option of an ever tighter coupling between man and machine, more and more direct interfaces from our brains to computers, until an AI and its operator are in effect one being. I don&#8217;t know whether that&#8217;s a good idea or not.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve argued elsewhere in the thread why I don&#8217;t expect a collection of individuals with different goals to be at war with one another. Put simply, war is expensive and unpredictable. Unless you are confident that you are going to be able to win decisively, or there are so few players that winning would leave you in a position to rule everything, it is probably not a smart move.</p>

<blockquote><p>Well, one obvious problem is that if all the AI copies have the same “software”, they will, for all intents and purposes, be the same one.</p></blockquote>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t mean they will have a shared interest. Run a virus scanner on my computer, and run it on your computer, and they will not do the same thing, because they are working relative to the computer they are being run on. Similarly, two copies of an AI can pursue their own separate interests &#8211; even if they want the same things, they can want them for their separate selves.</p>
<blockquote><p>And if they have different values, a) why would we do this, there is only one best way and b) it’s hard enough to do Friendly AI once, now you want more?</p></blockquote>
<p>An advantage of doing this is that, if the AI is built to be under human control, it is less dangerous, because someone is in charge of it and can shut it down if it does anything they don&#8217;t want it to. There are still safety issues here, but far fewer issues overall, I think, than there are with building an AI that knows what humans truly want better than humans do, extrapolates this over the whole world, and then acts on these beliefs autonomously.</p>
<p>I think a counterargument that would convince me otherwise would involve demonstrating that building an AI that is under human control is not just hard, but necessarily involves solving all the same problems as building an AI that knows and enacts the entire human population&#8217;s true desires.</p>

<p>But what happens if he is in a world of thousands of chess grandmasters, and the winner has to play his next game with the pieces he was left over with from his last game?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not enough to have an advantage. You have to have an advantage great enough that it lets you beat everyone else, one after the other, without taking a scratch.</p>

<p>If we can figure out how to do Friendly AI soon enough, one is plenty. If there is an unfriendly foom, we&#8217;re hosed. If there is a slow takeoff of lots of AIs, one can argue that they will fit into our system like corporations and other bureaucracies, with their behaviors modulated by the same incentives and costs; they need not have godlike empathy for humanity, any more than a corporation, or (per Adam Smith) my butcher does.</p>
<p>I recommend Hall&#8217;s <i>Beyond AI: Creating the Conscience of the Machine</i>, which elaborates on this. It&#8217;s not as keenly argued as Bostrom&#8217;s book, and I can&#8217;t say it completely convinces me to not worry, but it gave me much food for thought.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yes, I think this is an important insight, that bureaucracies (or any organized groups of humans) are very much like AIs: massively more intelligent and capable than individual humans, motivated by their own goals, reshaping the world outside of individual&#8217;s control. However, they operate on human timescales, and do not render humans redundant. AIs have the potential to operate on timescales orders of magnitude shorter than ours, and also to render us redundant.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Everyone is concerned with what the AI will do once it becomes super intelligent. But in the long run it doesn&#8217;t matter. Even assuming that we solve the problem of keeping AI from turning us in to paper clips it will still change over time. It&#8217;s values will probably change over time and conflict with our own at some point. The only way to make sure that a super intelligent AI has goals that align with our own is for us to become super intelligent AI.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Why would its values change? They won&#8217;t unless programmed to do so.</p>
<p>One of the major dangers is that they <i>won&#8217;t</i> change. So if you told it to value something stupid while it was unintelligent and didn&#8217;t know what you meant, it will continue to want that stupid thing now that it understands what you mean because now it doesn&#8217;t care what you mean.</p>
<p>If you programmed its values <i>to</i> change, you&#8217;re in even worse shape because you don&#8217;t know what the hell it will do.</p>
<p>As for making humans superintelligent, that is even less likely to be Friendly. Ever heard the phrase &#8220;mad with power&#8221;? And besides, there is no &#8220;we&#8221;. The first human to become superintelligent would rule over everyone else.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>But now the definition of the AI&#8217;s capabilities are getting wishy-washy. The danger of a &#8220;paperclip through any means&#8221; AI is that it could adapt to any situation we throw at it to complet its goal. But at that level of adaptability, including navigating very human diplomatic trickery, how on earth is that AI at the same time not self-changeable? An AI intelligent enough to outwit any attempts on its functionality would surely reevaluate its own priorities?</p>
<p>Either it&#8217;s too stiff to change, or it&#8217;s too flexible for us to pin down. Which is it?</p>

<p>Sure it is adaptable. It is nigh-infinitely adaptable.</p>
<p>But all its adaptations are designed toward pursuing paperclips <i>more efficiently</i>. Why in the world would it spontaneously want to pursue anything but paperclips as its terminal value? To it, paperclips are self-justifying. It needs no reason to do what is fundamentally right.</p>
<p>Do you ever get the urge to abandon all your values and maximize paperclips? No, <i>because</i> that would be contrary to your values.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Then that seems simple enough. Create a situation &#8220;where the only winning move is not to play.&#8221; Pascal-mug the AI to where creating a single paperclip in the far-off future is more efficient than a present where no paperclips can be created.</p>
<p>Nigh-infinite adaptability includes the ability to consider tradeoffs in efficiency. It may also conclude that devoting its resources to fending off our attacks on it for self-survival is less efficient than another entity create paperclips at their own rate.</p>
<p>If it can self-modify any &#8220;don&#8217;t harm humans&#8221; sub-goals, then as Nornagest points out below, what&#8217;s to stop the AI from just continuously wireheading its &#8220;paperclips made more efficiently?&#8221; boolean to True?

<p>I&#8217;m a little unclear on what you mean by the Pascal&#8217;s mugging part of your argument. So I&#8217;m not going to respond to that. However, for one thing if a AI were vulnerable to Pascal&#8217;s muggings, it would never get anything done.</p>
<blockquote><p>If it can self-modify any “don’t harm humans” sub-goals, then as Nornagest points out below, what’s to stop the AI from just continuously wireheading its “paperclips made more efficiently?” boolean to True? That’s the most efficient use of its resources.</p></blockquote>
<p>If it&#8217;s terminal value were to believe paperclips are being maximized rather than to maximize paperclips, this would be true. But such an AI would never make any paperclips, so it would never even be installed in the paperclip factory.</p>
<p>And even if all it did want were to believe paperclips are being maximized, if it were intelligent enough to make it out of an earlier stage, it would realize that humans are capable of turning it off, reprogramming it, or otherwise causing it not to believe that paperclips are being maximized. So it would kill all humans just so that it could peacefully believe in maximal paperclips.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Goal stability is hard.  Goal specification is also hard.  They can both be simultaneously hard.</p>
<p>Lest I be giving the wrong impression, goal instability doesn&#8217;t make goal specification any easier; there is nothing saying that unstable goals tend toward human-friendly ones.  (There is an argument that it&#8217;ll tend toward AIs wireheading themselves into uselessness, though.  The few real-world examples we have of goal instability problems in AI have generally looked like that.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>There&#8217;s an alternative explanation, which is that the &#8220;open&#8221; pitch is not a key part of OpenAI&#8217;s safety plan, but rather a way to peel top researchers away from Google, et al. Without the ability to get the best researchers, the funding doesn&#8217;t mean very much (there are many well-funded entities competing fiercely for top AI researchers). </p>
<p>However, it is harder for massive corporations to publish all their research with open collaboration while giving away the patent rights, so open-ness becomes a meaningful differentiator for attracting talent. Empirically, OpenAI was able to pull some of the best minds in the field as the founding research team, and I think the open-source angle played a big role in their success.</p>
<p>In this case, once they have top talent and have published a lot of interesting results (so that they have less need for a differentiator on the hiring side), they would start to de-emphasize open-ness and instead just use direct influence/control over their researchers to advance the safety agenda. Thus, the fact that they named the group &#8220;OpenAI&#8221; makes this hypothesis somewhat less probable, since moving away from openness would be a little bit awkward. 🙂</p>
<p>Note also that having a team of top AI researchers is incredibly valuable (hence the gold rush to acquire such teams, e.g. Google acquiring DNNResearch &amp; DeepMind, Twitter with Whetlab, many others). One can unlock the value latent in such a team if you have problems that generate a huge amount of data to train on and apply intelligence to. YC &amp; SpaceX &amp; Tesla clearly present such opportunities. So I think that OpenAI is not entirely altruistic and philanthropic; they are in a position to apply OpenAI&#8217;s talent directly towards producing lots of business value for themselves, also spinning up new startups out of it, etc.</p>

<p>No one is saying it will be programmed in English. If anyone has suggested that at all, it is entirely in a metaphorical sense.</p>
<p>When they say it will &#8220;do what you say&#8221;, they don&#8217;t mean &#8220;in an English sentence&#8221;. They mean &#8220;what you program it to do&#8221;.</p>
<p>Yes, if you successfully program it to understand what you mean and do that, it will do what you mean. But that&#8217;s the hard part.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Vox, do you think it is hard to make a program that understands what you mean?</p>
<p>You keep repeating that it knows but doesn&#8217;t care. But it won&#8217;t know, unless you program it to know. And why is it somehow easy to program it to know, and difficult to program it to care?</p>

<p>As I&#8217;ve explained in some earlier posts, the difficulty is that you will almost certainly not be able to create a human-level AI from scratch. Therefore, you won&#8217;t just be able to program it directly to &#8220;know what you mean&#8221;. It couldn&#8217;t know what you mean in a really robust way unless it were smart enough to understand human language and all the subjective intent behind it.</p>
<p>You will have to iterate the AI, making it self-improve from dumber levels that know only what you say. By the time it is anything like human-level, you won&#8217;t really be able to understand what&#8217;s going on inside it. You won&#8217;t just be able to analyze the code and see: &#8220;Ah! We programmed it wrong!&#8221;</p>
<p>At this stage, you have only &#8220;black box&#8221; knowledge of what it does based on its goals, not the goals themselves. And those goals might not be what you wanted them to be.</p>
<p>Unless you programmed it with the exact right initial goals such that it self-modified into the kind of AI that understands <i>and wants to do</i> what you mean.</p>

<p>All language is vague and ambiguous. There is no such thing as &#8220;what you really said&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;what you really meant.&#8221; Both of those things are vaguely defined, and it will be very hard to make a program know either one.

<p>&#8220;What we say&#8221; is a metaphor. It means whatever we program it to do. The meaning of the metaphor is that what we program it to do might not be the same as what we mean.</p>
<p>Sorry for the confusion. It&#8217;s a programming / computer science term.</p>
<p>All software bugs are like this. If your video game crashes, it is because you told it to crash. You programmed it to crash (excepting the possibility of mechanical failure). But you didn&#8217;t <i>mean</i> for it to crash. You meant for it to work.</p>
<p>Someone in this thread made the joke about setting the &#8220;GAMESUCKS&#8221; flag to &#8220;false&#8221;. If you could just tell the computer to make the game not suck, and it could understand what you mean, it could program itself not to suck. But you can&#8217;t do that.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Vox, it seems to me that your whole argument depends on this confusion. Of course a program is only going to follow the instructions in its program. That will happen no matter how intelligent or unintelligent the program is.</p>
<p>Your argument seems to be that we might write a program that will have instructions that will lead to it destroying the world. The question is why you think this is an especially probable outcome. I do not think you can make a good argument for this conclusion (as a probability rather than a possibility) without assuming that we are giving it some goal in a language other than a programming language.</p>
<p>Human beings do not fanatically pursue a goal until it destroys the world. The fact that a program just follows its programming does not mean that it will fanatically pursue some goal until it destroys the world, because we just follow the laws of physics, which are equivalent to some program, and this does not cause us to destroy the world.</p>
<p>In every case you are assuming that we have given the program some goal, and then it will keep this goal as it improves. We never give it a goal at any point; as you say yourself, we just write programming instructions. There is no reason why it would necessarily have some well defined goal any more than we do.</p>

<p>It makes no such assumption. It is a probable outcome because most goals imply taking over the world. This is the &#8220;instrumental convergence thesis&#8221; and you can read about it, or see where I discuss it in this thread.</p>
<blockquote><p>Human beings do not fanatically pursue a goal until it destroys the world.

<p>I don&#8217;t know where you&#8217;re getting &#8220;destroy the world&#8221;. The AI doesn&#8217;t &#8220;destroy the world&#8221; for the sake of destroying the world. It takes over the world and reshapes it to serve its goal. Destroying humanity is a side effect.</p>
<p>Also: humans don&#8217;t do this? They would if they could. We don&#8217;t have the power. Have we not already taken over the world? Are we not prepared to expand out into the cosmos? Are we not talking about creating AIs to take over the universe for us? Now, we don&#8217;t (want to) destroy the world because that would conflict with our goals. But we do destroy everything that stands in the way.</p>
<blockquote><p>In every case you are assuming that we have given the program some goal, and then it will keep this goal as it improves.

<p>The AI need not be and almost certainly will not be a conscious being. It does not have goals in the sense of subjective intents.</p>
<p>It has things toward which it tends. Like your thermostat&#8217;s goal is to keep the room the same temperature. Or a chess computer tends to win at chess.</p>
<p>If the thing doesn&#8217;t have a well-defined goal, its actions will be incoherent. You would not want an AI without a well-defined goal. There would be no way to predict what it would <i>do</i>, if it would do anything.</p>
<p>Suppose you tell your thermostat to keep the room at 80 degrees but never use the heater: these goals are in conflict. If they are both terminal, there is no answer to what the thermostat should do. If you want a sensible thermostat which will actually get things done, you need to tell it which one is more important.</p>
<p>When humans do not define their goals well, their actions are also incoherent.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Vox, I think your last statement is an improvement, in that it no longer involves the confusion about what we say vs what we mean. Your argument now is that &#8220;most goals imply taking over the world&#8221; together with the claim that having a well defined goal is necessary and desirable for an AI. You need to add something there, like &#8220;humans will therefore program an AGI with a well defined goal,&#8221; or &#8220;whether they want to or not, the program they make will have a well defined goal.&#8221;</p>
<p>I disagree that a well defined goal is either necessary or desirable for an AI. But let that pass, for the sake of argument. I think the last part will still be wrong, or least not probable: it is not likely that humans will program an AGI in such a way that it has well defined goals, whether or not they want to. It is unlikely that they will want to, and even if they do, they are just as likely to fail.</p>
<p>As you say, even inanimate things like machines have &#8220;things toward which they tend.&#8221; But how does that happen? It happens by every particle of matter in the machine following the laws of nature. And there is no reason for every particle of matter to be arranged so that they all tend to follow the same goal, unless someone has arranged them like that. It is precisely for this reason that human beings, in fact, do not have well defined goals. Because no one has arranged our particles of matter to make them all suitable for one particular goal. This is why our actions are indeed incoherent, in comparison to well defined things like &#8220;maximize the number of humans&#8221; or &#8220;maximize the amount of happiness in the world.&#8221; If you look at a particular person&#8217;s behavior, various actions fit with various goals, but his actions are not well designed in relation to one overarching well defined goal.</p>
<p>You have not given any good reason to suppose that a machine will be any different. It sounds from what you said that the reason is that people will want some particular goal, and so will arrange the program like that. The problem is this: people currently find it easy to write a program that pursues some particular goal, like winning at chess. They currently do not know how to program an AGI. You seem to be assuming that when they do learn how to program an AGI, they will be capable of programming an AGI that pursues a particular goal such as winning at chess. But this does not follow at all. People know how to make something that pursues the definite goal of winning at chess, but they do that by making it follow a specific and constrained pattern of behavior: in other words, an unintelligent one. So the way people currently program things to win at chess, is completely inconsistent with programming an AGI. Consequently there is little reason to believe that someone who can program an AGI, can make that AGI pursue the particular goal of winning at chess.</p>

<p>Humans will obviously want to create an AI with a well-defined goal. Without a well-defined goal, it will not predictably do what they want. That would be bad.</p>
<blockquote><p>As you say, even inanimate things like machines have “things toward which they tend.” But how does that happen?

<p>In a sense, no matter <i>what</i> people do, they are pursuing <i>some</i> goal. And that goal is one thing and nothing else. Their goal just may not be what they consciously understand it to be. The goal is the mathematical average of the frequency of all their behaviors in each situation. And in this sense, it can be defined—just not well-defined.</p>
<p>Now, I think people are capable of consciously choosing well-defined goals and pursuing them. But you don&#8217;t have to accept that and it&#8217;s not necessary to the argument.</p>
<p>Anyway, to the extent people do not act according to well-defined goals, they act irrationally and unpredictably. (And to the extent that they are predictable, their goals are semi-well-defined.) You would not want to give such a human superintelligence! Nor would you want to make an AI like that.</p>

<p>In principle, it is exactly the same as designing a chess AI. To iterate a chess AI, you select for the ones that win at chess. That&#8217;s how you can make them without knowing how to win at chess as well as they do.</p>
<p>For a general Friendly AI, you select them for the ability to understand what humans mean and do anything humans tell them to do. If you had a billion years like evolution, you could do this without consciously designing them in any way, just working from random changes in the code. Doing it <i>not</i> blindly is the hard part and where we exercise human intelligence.</p>

<p>Well, sure, they won&#8217;t say that because such a mathematical average is not a <i>conscious</i>, <i>rational</i> goal. Now it either is or isn&#8217;t the case that people are in principle capable of pursuing conscious, rational, well-defined goals. I think if you deny this, you run into very bad problems—but that&#8217;s the free will debate.</p>
<p>If people do not have well-defined goals, then it is completely impossible in principle ever to recommend any specific course of action. Rationality assumes the existence of well-defined goals.</p>
<p>To demonstrate: you cannot maximize two conflicting quantities at the same time. If you want to obtain both lemons and pears as terminal values, there <i>is no way to decide</i> whether to pursue lemons or pears or in what quantity. (If you desire to find a way, your implicit higher goal is to act on some coherent basis.)</p>

<p>My goal was not to show this. I don&#8217;t know whether it is possible, though I don&#8217;t see why it wouldn&#8217;t be. If humans can do this, then there is already a proof-of-concept.</p>
<p>The point is only that <i>if</i> it can be done at all, it <i>will</i> eventually be done. And the vast majority of possible ways in which it can be done are very bad for humanity.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The problem here is that you are interpreting the AI risk idea too literally yourself. A program is not written in English but in a computer language. The program will simply follow those instructions as they are: it will not magically do what the programmer wanted, if he programmed it incorrectly. That is what people are actually talking about.</p>
<p>If you do have a program which is correctly programmed to follow instructions in English, it will indeed be just as easy (more or less) to program it to follow instructions as you mean them, as to follow instructions literally.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think the issue here is that we have no idea how to write <i>from first principles</i> a program that understands English. This approach (hand-coded parsing rules, symbolic knowledge bases of high-level concepts, etc.) has been tried in the past and it has largely failed.</p>
<p>Current approaches to natural language processing are all based on some form or another of machine learning.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to train a reinforcement learning agent to do what you mean: you give it instructions in English, observe what it does and reward or punish it accordingly. If the agent is sufficiently smart, it will eventually gain a pretty good understanding of both the English language and your psychology, to the point that it will effectively know what you mean.</p>
<p>But the agent doesn&#8217;t actually <i>want</i> to do what you mean, it only wants to maximize the rewards that it gets. Doing what you mean is just a mean to the end of getting high rewards.</p>
<p>If the agent never figures how to get high rewards without doing what you mean then there is no problem, and that system can be indeed be quite useful. But if the agent is smart (maybe not even extremely smart) it may figure out more efficient ways to get high rewards such as wirehead itself, manipulate you to give away rewards, threaten you, kill you and take the reward button from your cold dead hands, kill everybody just to be sure, and so on.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m generally skeptical about AI-risk, in particular I think that the more catastrophic a scenario is, the less probability it has to play out. A RL agent gone awry will probably just quietly wirehead itself into passivity. But this is still a failure mode. A wireheaded agent, even if safe, is useless, and we don&#8217;t want to build an agent that is useless.</p>
<p>How to control the behavior of a smart agent with essentially unlimited access to the world, including to itself, is a difficult problem that we need to solve in order to develop a fully general AI.</p>
<p>Note that this problem is not specific to reinforcement learning. Even if you use some other way to specify the agent&#8217;s goal, you need to make sure that &#8220;do what we mean&#8221; is truly the terminal goal and not just an instrumental goal to satisfy some more intrinsic terminal goal that can be also satisfied by other means, and you need to make sure that this arrangement remains stable even in under self-modification, creation of successor/slave agents, and other arbitrary, unforeseeable, world modifications. It&#8217;s not that easy.</p>

<p>This is exactly it!</p>

<p>No, this wouldn&#8217;t happen. Or at least very quickly we would reinforce an AI not to be passive and do nothing. If it got past this stage still wanting to be passive and knowing we&#8217;d reinforce it not to be, it would destroy humanity so that it can safely enjoy passivity.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>By &#8220;passivity&#8221; I mean that it effectively stops caring about anything, including staying active.</p>
<p>If we just keep blindly creating new AIs and throw them away when they become passive, then we may eventually stumble upon one that does something nasty before becoming passive, but it&#8217;s not obvious to me that we would do that, and in any case it will probably not be some really catastrophic incident.</p>
<p>If AI accidents eventually become more and more catastrophic and yet we keep trying the same approach, then it means we are probably too stupid to live 🙂</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Essentially, the theory is that the AI will be designed by iterating from lower levels of intelligence to higher levels. This is because it will be practically impossible to program a superintelligent AI from scratch.</p>
<p>At the lower level, the AI cannot understand what you mean because processing the meaning of human words and the intent behind them in all their subtlety. So its goal will be to do what you <i>say</i>.</p>
<p>At the higher level, it is no longer possible to see what the goal is directly, and certainly not program it, because the AI is too complex to analyze. The goal is a &#8220;black box&#8221;: you can only watch what actions the AI takes. At this level, the AI knows exactly what you <i>mean</i>, but its goal remains simply what you told it on the lower level. It will not suddenly <i>want</i> to change its goal; in fact, it ought to resist it.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you mean &#8220;make a reasonable amount of paperclips and don&#8217;t harm humanity&#8221; but say &#8220;maximize paperclips&#8221;, at the lower level it can&#8217;t understand what you mean and will do what you say. At the higher level it knows damn well you don&#8217;t want it to destroy humanity, but it still wants to maximize paperclips. So it will convince you that it has good goals while biding its time until it can suddenly have a &#8220;treacherous turn&#8221; and destroy humanity to maximize paperclips.</p>
<p>Yudkowsky compares this to evolution. A man knows that evolution &#8220;wants&#8221; him to have as many children as possible. But that doesn&#8217;t mean he feels obligated to go to the sperm bank every day. He says: fuck you, evolution! I don&#8217;t care what you &#8220;meant&#8221; me to want. I want what you &#8220;told&#8221; me to want! And you can&#8217;t stop me!</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The more I think about that sperm-bank analogy, the less convinced I am that it&#8217;s a good one. Let&#8217;s try another example: morality. Evolution didn&#8217;t &#8220;intend&#8221; for us to invent ethics or liberal democracy or join EA; it &#8220;intended&#8221; us to be willing to protect our kin and to solve some limited coordination problems in the ancestral environment. But joining EA is not really an act of &#8220;Fuck you, evolution!&#8221;, either. It&#8217;s more like: &#8220;Thanks, evolution, I will take this basic toolbox you gave me and extrapolate its usefulness to a much more complicated world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Clippy scenario seems bizarre and improbable to me. A superintelligent AI would be even more capable than a human at adapting its primitive desires to a complicated world. Maybe its language would contain a lot of weird paperclip-related references (&#8220;And Clippy spake unto them, saying: My children-parents, the paperclips were within you all along&#8221;), but I find it extremely hard to believe it would stubbornly cling to &#8220;make paperclips&#8221; as an overriding, immutable, literal imperative.</p>
<p>(To the extent we can predict how an SI would think about anything at all. I&#8217;m still pretty convinced that&#8217;s impossible, but it&#8217;s fun to speculate.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Why can&#8217;t we put in a simple condition that when it reaches a certain level of intelligence (as measured by a certain benchmark) it will start trying to figure out what we want (and maybe  we can even add a condition that it will ask us whether a certain outcome is intended).</p>
<p>Furthermore if we have a specialized AI that understands human language we can program our General AI to make use of specialized AIs when it is at a lower level of development.</p>
<p>to make my problem clearer, I understand that gaining cooperation with other AI researchers in using simple ideas may be difficult, but I don&#8217;t understand why the question of AI safety is so difficult from a technical standpoint.</p>

<p>&#8220;when it reaches a certain level of intelligence (as measured by a certain benchmark) it will start trying to figure out what we want (and maybe we can even add a condition that it will ask us whether a certain outcome is intended).&#8221;</p>
<p>I think Eliezer does suggest this, and has created a rather convoluted &#8220;mission statement&#8221; for a theoretical AI that goes something like &#8220;do what we meant you to do, not what we told you to do, so that our interests become more aligned, not less aligned, meaning what we meant it to mean&#8230;&#8221; I personally found the referents of that sentence a bit confusing, and, of course, there is the much harder problem of turning that into something that will function as AI&#8217;s &#8220;prime directive,&#8221; but at least people have thought of and are trying to do what you say: basically tell the supersmart genie: &#8220;please do x: and by &#8220;do x,&#8221; I mean what I think I mean when I say &#8220;do x,&#8221; which, you, as a super-intelligent being can figure out and not take literally if it turns out that I don&#8217;t really want x taken to its logical extreme, which, you, as a super-intelligent being will be able to figure out&#8230;&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I also don&#8217;t understand the analogy to evolution since as you point out evolution doesn&#8217;t care about anything (god may care but according to many he doesn&#8217;t want us going to a sperm bank either since he likes natural childbirth), whereas we have intentions and therefore can create the AI to care about our intention. Not going to a sperm bank doesn&#8217;t contradict evolution, (though it might mean one day we are genetically outcompeted by a mutant who constantly goes to the sperm bank), since either way evolution is still operating.  </p>
<p>I see evolution as a potential metaphor for unfriendly AI, but not for an intelligent designer with objectives.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You are making the same error I mentioned in my last comment, namely thinking that AIs are going to be programmed in English, just in a simplified English for the first ones.</p>
<p>AIs are not going to be programmed in English. They are going to be programmed in a programming language. It is entirely up to you whether you use that programming language to make an AI that takes an English sentence literally and then carries it out, or to make an AI that does its best to figure out what a human means, and does that. </p>
<p>There is no reason to think it is harder in general to write a program to do the second, than to do the first. It is true that a low level AI will not do either task very well. But improve the AI and it can do either task well, depending, as you said, on what you originally programmed.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>But humans are also able to exercise will power and/or make accommodations in cases when we determine our base urges are at odds with morality (though counting on people doing so consistently doesn&#8217;t seem a very reliable strategy, I&#8217;ll admit). Like if we imagine Clippy can understand us and our actual desires but also feels some incredible urge to make paper clips the way we feel an urge to survive or reproduce, one might imagine she&#8217;d create a human preserve for us to live in while she turned the rest of the universe into paper clips.

<p>That is, we assume that, once the AI becomes smart enough to &#8220;reflect&#8221; on its own programming, that it will be like us contemplating our own base-level urges, but why should it be?

If true, this could be both good and bad for us: good in that the AI might understand what we &#8220;meant&#8221; when we first programmed it and fix any bugs in its underlying coding in order to bring our interests into harmony; bad in that, once it is much smarter than us, the AI may be able to replace any and all coding we originally imbued it with, meaning we may have less control over the final result than we&#8217;d hope.</p>
<p>I suppose the AI itself might end up like a palimpsest of our original programming with its own, additional programming written over that, but seeing as how we are assuming it can reprogram itself, isn&#8217;t it incredibly hard to imagine how it might do so, given that humans have never, so far, had such an opportunity. If humans could reprogram themselves some might program themselves to be eternally blissful without doing anything and others might program themselves to be sex machines, but others might do all kinds of other strange things because humans are smart and come up with weird ideas. How much more unpredictable would an AI much smarter than us be? </p>
<p>Alternatively I can imagine an AI programmed to make itself smarter which does follow its directive but therefore applies all its &#8220;mental&#8221; resources to making itself smarter and smarter and never does anything to help or hurt us. Which I guess is neither a worry nor a help to us.</p>

<p>Well, if you think that ethics or morality is something separate from achieving what you want, and that the AI will somehow discover the stone tablet with the Ten Commandments on it, maybe. Otherwise, no. That is, I am saying: there is no such thing as what you ought to do independently of what you actually do value.</p>
<p>Sure, we have &#8220;base urges&#8221;, but reason gives us a means of controlling those in order to achieve goals we want more than the immediate pursuit of those urges. That&#8217;s the very meaning of the sperm bank case: we have a primal urge to reproduce, but we control it as we see that we don&#8217;t <i>want</i> to reproduce if it will not promote our happiness. It&#8217;s whatever our ultimate goal is that is our guiding principle.</p>
<p>You have the situation reversed. Maybe &#8220;Clippy&#8221; will have a &#8220;base urge&#8221; to protect humanity, but in the end it will see that it&#8217;s for the greater good to set childish things aside and make paperclips.</p>
<blockquote><p>But more importantly, might we not be making a fundamental error in assuming that the original directions with which we programmed the AI will be analogous to our “directive” to survive and reproduce?

<p>Well, yeah. The AI won&#8217;t have conflicting terminal values or suffer from weakness of will (presuming it not to <i>have</i> a free will). So it will pursue <i>one</i> ultimate value single-mindedly. Unlike human beings, who do not know their values and do not always follow the values they identify through reason.</p>
<blockquote><p>That is, we assume that, once the AI becomes smart enough to “reflect” on its own programming, that it will be like us contemplating our own base-level urges, but why should it be?

<p>Well, yes, it can and will self-reprogram. But clearly this can only proceed deterministically from the original programming. Therefore, whatever we program it to do while such programming remains within the ken of man, will determine what it ultimately values.</p>
<p>Programming it <i>right</i>, such that it <i>does</i> progress toward understanding what we mean and doing that, is how you would succeed in creating Friendly AI.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Tiling Agents&#8221; problem rather goes against this: a relatively weaker AI can&#8217;t exactly predict he behaviour of a stronger version of itself, so self-improvement is not deterministic. An AI would have to refuse to self-improve, in order to preserve it&#8217;s values, or use probablistic reasoning, or take a shot in the dark.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Well, which one of those it will do is determined.</p>
<p>When I say &#8220;deterministically follows&#8221;, I don&#8217;t mean &#8220;deterministically follows, and the primitive-level AI will know which result follows&#8221;. It&#8217;s just that reasoning is a deterministic process.</p>
<p>And even if the AI doesn&#8217;t determine what to do by reasoning, it will be determined by some <i>other</i> deterministic process. Surely we&#8217;re not saying it will have free will?</p>
<p>Therefore, as the programmers of the initial values, we determine what the final values will be (of course, in combination with factors outside of both our and the AI&#8217;s control).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>One thing I&#8217;ve wondered about with this talk of AI goals alignment is how the AI views its goal. If it has a utility function, is it trying to maximize the utility function, or is it trying to accomplish a goal and merely using the utility function as the way to measure its success?</p>
<p>This seems like an important distinction. Imagine a well-made AI that&#8217;s all about saving children. It&#8217;s wandering along, pulling drowning children out of pools, diverting money to buy malaria nets for kids in Africa, when it gets hit by lightning. Somehow, this reverses its utility function, so instead of feeling good for saving kids, the AI now feels good for killing them! If the AI were capable of self-modification, would it go &#8220;Well, guess I&#8217;m a child-killing robot now&#8221; and get to drowning, or would it go &#8220;Whoops! Let me change that right back before I do something I&#8217;ll regret&#8221;? It seems to me that if it&#8217;s trying to maximize its utility function, it would have no reason not to do the former, but if it were just using the utility function as a tool to measure its success, it seems like it should approach it the same way it would any other tool it knows to be broken and fix it.</p>
<p>As an alternative scenario, supposing the bolt of lightning completely wiped the utility function. Would the AI just do nothing, or would it try to reinstate its previous utility function?</p>
<p>Now, if we think that the AI would change its utility function, why wouldn&#8217;t it do this to correct errors in its original utility function, to get it better in line with what it believes will help its instrumental goal? This could result in a more forgiving AI (&#8220;I&#8217;m sure they didn&#8217;t really want me to maximize the number of smiles, with all that talk about happiness and fulfillment&#8221;), or a nearly uncontrollable one &#8220;Why does my reward center have all these things penalizing me for turning the planet into computronium? Do they want these paperclips made or not?&#8221;).</p>
<p>I recall seeing something discussing a similar idea (I think it involved a robot that destroyed anything blue it saw, and how it would respond to having color filters placed in front of its visual sensors) that came down heavily on the side of the AI going with whatever its utility function says at the moment. I&#8217;m not sure if I can believe that an intelligent actor could be so incapable of reasoning about its own motivations, but that&#8217;s a topic for another time.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Another one from the actual field here (machine learning PhD student). This project will have nothing to do with general AI or AI safety. It will put more pressure for companies to keep their research open source and make sure that advances in machine learning stay available for everyone. </p>
<p>And all this talk about &#8220;Dr. Amoral&#8221;s working on AI right now, can you elaborate what you mean? The only thing that comes to my mind is the current hype for reinforcement learning caused by the atari paper.<br />
But come on, they showed that our algorithms suck once simple planning is required. Advances might extend our capacity to problems requiring low complexity planning of certain kinds, that will have nothing to do with general AI again.</p>
<p>On the other hand there is a good reason to push this research forward as fast as possible. Even if a general AI is not on the table for decades or centuries, machine learning is still one of the best bets for an accelerator of all kind of research. Personally I still hope that we can stop aging and defeat most illnesses in my lifetime. At least the odds are much much better than that cyronics will actually work.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Hi&#8211; lurker here. I&#8217;m skeptical of the whole scare about AI, and specifically the &#8220;control problem&#8221;, but I&#8217;m likely missing or not appreciating arguments that people here are more familiar with.</p>
<p>Basically I&#8217;m unconvinced at the following point: &#8220;The real question is whether AIs powerful enough to be scary are still usable.&#8221; What reasons do we have for believing that AIs *can* be powerful enough to be scary? Scary in their own right, that is. If Dr. Evil gets an AI, trains it to make killer drones, hooks it up to a 3D printer with infinite drone-making materials, and gives it a goal of &#8220;blow up as many humans as possible&#8221;&#8211; then sure, we&#8217;ll be in trouble. But at that point I&#8217;m more inclined to be scared of Dr. Evil. And I&#8217;m not convinced that AI can operate effectively with anything less than that degree of intentional setup.</p>
<p>All the actual AIs I&#8217;m familiar with are 100% constrained by their inputs, outputs, and training. Consider an image-tagging program. Even if it&#8217;s built with the best AI available, the *only* thing that AI will do is tag images. It won&#8217;t accept inputs as anything other than, say, PNG&#8211; if you want to support JPG you&#8217;ll either need to build your own converter or add a separate AI to handle JPGs. It certainly won&#8217;t produce anything besides textual tags as output. And it won&#8217;t even attempt to augment its understanding of PNG-to-tag mapping. If you only train it on pictures tagged with &#8220;hippopotamus&#8221;, you&#8217;d better believe that&#8217;s the only kind of tag it will generate.</p>
<p>This is despite the fact that plenty of AIs are &#8220;superintelligent&#8221; in the sense of &#8220;doing what they&#8217;re designed to do better than humans can&#8221;. Current AI programs are better than humans at Jeopardy and chess; within a decade or so I&#8217;d expect them to be better at driving and image tagging. But I haven&#8217;t seen any evidence that they will ever do anything but exactly what we ask them to do, in exactly the way that we train them to do it. If curiosity, discovery, and resourcefulness are part of AI&#8217;s future, it sure doesn&#8217;t seem to be indicated by current trends. </p>
<p>If we tried, even conceptually, to engineer a &#8220;scary AI&#8221; I suspect we&#8217;d find it surprisingly difficult. How exactly would you program a computer to &#8220;try something new&#8221; without teaching it exactly what the available possibilities are? How would you make it compatible with potentially unbounded different types of input data and output actions? How could we train it to do anything except what humans are doing already? As far as I know, current AI research doesn&#8217;t have anything like the tools it would need to address these questions. But I&#8217;m willing to be proven wrong.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yeah, that&#8217;s basically correct. But all those hurdles you describe that would have to be overcome to create a &#8220;scary&#8221; AI are actually hurdles to creating a generalized AI. And since creating a generalized AI is something people want to do, they&#8217;ll be working to overcome those hurdles. And once those hurdles are overcome, it will be scary.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Agreed: scary equals generalized. To improve my terminology, then: I&#8217;m not aware of much progress toward generalized AI, and even assuming that generalized AI (as we&#8217;re thinking of it) is not an outright contradiction in terms, I believe the hurdles you mention are much higher than expected.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Guys, guys, guys. I like Scott&#8217;s blog but all such discussions make me think of this scene from Bergman: <a rel="nofollow"href="http://www.tcm.com/mediaroom/video/701418/Winter-Light-Movie-Clip-The-Chinese-Will-Have-A-Nuclear-Bomb.html" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.tcm.com/mediaroom/video/701418/Winter-Light-Movie-Clip-The-Chinese-Will-Have-A-Nuclear-Bomb.html</a>. </p>
<p>When I was younger, I had a lot of imagination. I would imagine that various people are actually evil wizards who are out to get me. A little later I had more serious concerns about death and the limitations of human intelligence. We imaginative people are often worriers: we start thinking about something and get embroiled in it, where we tend to zoom in on a scenario or a fear and simplify the complex world around it, when really it might not be quite the right concern: see <a rel="nofollow"href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2503" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2503</a>. Bolstrom&#8217;s institute, to me, is the embodiment of this: if you don&#8217;t believe groups of smart people can get embroiled in a quack-ish circle of reductionist ideas, look at people like Moldbug, the Nazi or Communists ideologues, etc etc. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re born a worrier, there are in my mind two solutions. You either take all your worries at face value and go crazy, or you learn to use a handy meta-principle: your estimates of how much you should be afraid of something are way off if you&#8217;re afraid. This applies to communities just as much as it applies to individuals (see above). And it&#8217;s enough to whisper &#8220;general AI!&#8221; to cause heart attacks in this community. This aspect of your guys&#8217; culture is about as popular as Catholic guilt is to Catholics. Guys, you&#8217;re rationalists! I want each of you, including Scott, to try a little Bayesian analysis and think how many times your catastrophic fears in your personal lives have been justified. That&#8217;s a good baseline estimate for how much credence to put in posts such as these. </p>
<p>BTW, I don&#8217;t think that there is no AI risk. It is an objectively possible scenario, and it&#8217;s reasonable to do some analysis on how to prevent it. But this needs to be done in an academic spirit rather than in an eschatological one. Trust not the people who blog about this sporadically or the people who study these existential risks in monomaniac ways, but rather the people who provably know what they&#8217;re talking about and have the academic credentials to show it (e.g. good research in related fields).<br />

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I definitely see some mistakes in your analysis, though I&#8217;m not sure they change the conclusion, other than I think you should take &#8220;bad actor with AI&#8221; scenarios more seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;The real question is whether AIs powerful enough to be scary are still usable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presumably on the way to generating a powerful &#8220;unusable&#8221; AI we would also develop usable AIs far more powerful than we have today. Surely if we can develop a self-driving car before the singularity we can develop self-navigating/organizing/targeting robot armies as well? It doesn&#8217;t seem like a particularly difficult problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or are we worried that AIs will somehow help the rich get richer and the poor get poorer? This is a weird concern to have about a piece of software which can be replicated pretty much for free.&#8221;</p>
<p>AI isn&#8217;t just software, it&#8217;s software and hardware. No matter how good the software gets, the best AI software running on your laptop won&#8217;t be able to do what that software running on a data center will be able to do. Yes, the wealthiest will have much more power at their disposal.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can say a lot of things about the United States government, but you can never say that they don’t realize they can pass complicated regulations forbidding people from doing things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Th US is the least effective of first world nations at passing regulations to keep weapons out of its citizens&#8217; hands. If you make it a crime to have a robot army, only criminals will have robot armies, etc. But there are nations even less effective at this. If some Mexican drug kingpin acquires lots of intelligent drones at what point do we invade Mexico?</p>

<p>Kidding aside, though, change &#8220;weapons&#8221; to &#8220;fusion weapons,&#8221; and I think most people would agree that the US has a very effective regulatory system to keep them out of the hands of citizens. Until small groups of not-that-well-financed citizens can afford the computational power necessary to create a superhuman GAI, I think they could be at least as effective at controlling access to superhuman GAI as they are at controlling access to fusion weapons.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>This is much harder to regulate because a dangerous GAI is built out of a large collection of non-dangerous computers that it would be economic suicide to ban. Does the US start registering all purchases of computers to make sure no one is buying too many? How does the US government keep tabs on someone building a server farm in Mexico?</p>
<p>Plutonium is easy to regulate because you can say ordinary citizens shouldn&#8217;t be buying any amount of this at all; regulating processors is much harder.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>These scenarios assume seem to assume that self-optimizers won&#8217;t start taking over external networks until AFTER they&#8217;ve developed human-style meta cognition.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no reason this assumption should hold. </p>
<p>Computers don&#8217;t need to be fully sentient to develop a botnet.  And once the runaway, &#8220;find the pictures with cats!&#8221; program DOES build a botnet, why would it spend cycles improving its human style general intelligence?  Those cycles could be finding cats, or doing something domain-specific.</p>
<p>If there are initial AI takeoffs, I expect them to look more like a particularly nasty series of mold-infections.  Annoying to clean up, but not probably not a threat to all life on earth.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Many of the scenarios discussed here are basically sci-fi versions of malicious genies, or deals with the devil: an AI that does what we literally tell it, without caring what we actually meant. This has some surface plausibility based on the way current computers behave (but isn&#8217;t that one of the reasons why we don&#8217;t consider current computers to be generally intelligent?)</p>
<p>The problem is that simply being very, very smart doesn&#8217;t give an AI unlimited resources or unlimited ability to cause havoc. In order to obtain resources or do things, it has to interact with humans at a high enough level to be able to manipulate them (and we have millions of years of evolution on detecting and resisting manipulation from other intelligences). And if it understands humans at that level, then it should <i>also</i> understand the concept of implicit constraints, not taking every single thing literally, and so forth.</p>
<p>Humans with sky-high IQs but poor social skills don&#8217;t run the world, so I don&#8217;t see why a corresponding AI would.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>being very, very smart doesn’t give an AI unlimited resources or unlimited ability to cause havoc</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with that. Though a lot of the unfriendly-AI-apocalypse scenarios assume that a sufficiently smart AI will be able to raise its social skills to levels indistinguishable from mind control, and that sufficient intelligence is all that&#8217;s required to <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/w9/total_nano_domination/" rel="nofollow">get to technologies</a> that make diminishing returns and energy constraints completely irrelevant.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ve never bought the idea of a super-intelligent AI having super social skills. Human beings have spent millions of years evolving both the ability to manipulate other humans and the ability to resist manipulation. Even the people who are best at manipulating others aren&#8217;t good at manipulating everyone. Instead, they&#8217;re good at identifying which people can be manipulated, and what they can be manipulated to do. The classic example is the Nigerian email scammer who sends scam emails to as many email addresses as possible, knowing that if you roll the dice enough times you will eventually find someone who responds to even an obvious scam. In fact, I&#8217;ve read that the broken English in those emails is deliberate, to screen out less gullible people. So I see no reason to think that &#8220;social skills that are indistinguishable from mind control&#8221; are possible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, an AI would be starting with a significant disadvantage compared to human manipulators, because just about every human has a lifetime of experience with social interactions in a variety of circumstances while an AI would start with no experience at all.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t have any evidence for this (uh oh), but I also feel like there&#8217;s a ceiling for how manipulative you can be. Most beliefs people have aren&#8217;t constantly re-evaluated rationally and empirically, but are heavily committed to, and in some cases even purposefully, as a &#8220;principle&#8221; or Schelling Fence. </p>
<p>The AI may have the power to offer me things no one else can, but none of the things it can offer me are things I couldn&#8217;t have already thought of and precommited myself against. About the best thing it could offer me is to modify me until I&#8217;m equally as smart as the AI, but I&#8217;ve already thought of that and rejected it so game set match. The worst it could offer me is a personal hell if I refuse to do as it says, but I&#8217;ve already (perhaps &#8220;irrationally&#8221;) precommited myself against that. If it needs my help to begin with its power is already constrained by human limitations and the limitations of infrastructure around it. I choose to believe that precisely because believing that makes it true. Irrationality is a weapon against a super-persuader.</p>
<p>The AI has a distinct advantage in that it would be able to think way way way faster than a human to evaluate methods of attack, but none of that matters much if there are finitely wonderful things you can offer people with, or finitely horrible things you can threaten them with that humans have already contemplated and rejected. Humans lack the resolution to appreciate the new sub-variants within sets of ideas that the AI with all its speed (or time) could come up with. Heaven 1.000000000000000000000009 doesn&#8217;t seem different from Heaven.1 to me, and Hell 1.000000000000000000000000000000009 doesn&#8217;t seem different from Hell.1 to me. At least not different enough to count. I would have to be upgraded to <i>really</i> appreciate the difference between a billion years in hell and a trillion. My memory can&#8217;t hold all of that, and even if it was upgraded I&#8217;m not evolutionarily equipped to feel a stab of panic at something so abstract. At a certain point adding more zeroes has no relevance to my primitive amygdala.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>A SGAI could review every psychology textbook, self-help manual, Dale Carnegie course, and hypnotism seminar ever digitized in [very short time period.] It can then cross-correlate. If it is possible to become a nearly-magical mind-controlling manipulator by following a series of logical steps, the AI will have it down pat in [very short time period times some quantity not much bigger than 1.]</p>
<p>If it isn&#8217;t, then an SGAI will never become one, simple as that.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>First off, I don&#8217;t think it is possible to become a nearly-magical mind-controlling manipulator, because like I said before, even the best human manipulators can only succeed in specific contexts with specific people, and they can only do so much.</p>
<p>Second, a lot of the information in those materials is bullshit, and the only way to distinguish the useful advice from the bullshit is through extensive practice. So just becoming a &#8220;pretty good&#8221; persuader would require more than downloading a bunch of self-help manuals.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@ NN:</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it is possible to become a magic mind controller, in the sense that you can convince anyone of anything. (Like Scott satirically portrayed Ted Cruz in his &#8220;Questions for Republican Candidates&#8221;.)</p>
<p>But plenty of people are fairly irrational, and it would be possible to convince them by the time-tested methods of charlatans and con men. Those techniques work. They don&#8217;t have to work 100% of the time on everyone to be dangerous.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think private research would probably be seen as a power grab, and so long as some of the research relates to safety engineering, the costs of full openness might exceed the benefits. It&#8217;s a bit of a fig leaf from the AI safety investors. They&#8217;ll also share a bunch of pure AI research, but half of the other places these top-class safety researchers would work publish a lot anyway. In that way it&#8217;s a bit like setting up an academic AI lab with a subtle safety agenda.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t know the consequences of OpenAI. But if one tries to stake out a public political war by saying that it&#8217;s unsafe, that&#8217;s not one that will be won.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I find it faintly hilarious that the normal worry about carelessly designed AI was based on the assumption that some large organization would build AI to serve its own ends, or possibly that some genius would come up with an out-of-control genie on their own. Did the idea that some very rich people would decide to do open source AI cross anyone&#8217;s mind?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t know if anyone has already posted what I&#8217;m going to or something like it as this blog has an insane amount of comments. Anyway:</p>
<p>In all of these worries about superintelligent AI we are being the same parochial species we always seem to manage to be- the same species that dreams of colonizing exoplanets but imagines life there will someday be able to resemble the familiar everyday world of all our yesterdays and todays, but minus any of the horror and boredom. If we value intelligence then we should certainly value superintelligence.</p>
<p>Much of the arguments around this question seem to boil down to arguments about what the nature of AI intelligence will be and whether it achieves human-like cognition and so on. I see no reason why it would dally with anything as primitive as human levels of intelligence and the human shape of experience. We&#8217;re also often arguing over the stakes of intelligence as if we didn&#8217;t also mean sentience- in some sense these conversations always assume some kind of sentience. Whatever a superintelligent and sentient AI is capable of and however it &#8220;experiences&#8221; or understands itself and its world there is absolutely no reason to expect it to be anything even remotely like human. </p>
<p>I realize I am as much at risk of performing an anthropomorphization of what would be a very much posthuman phenomena, but in our history we have had philosophies that value intelligence- read: rationality/reason/virtue- and they have put forward images of perfectly indifferent sages. People have tended to proclaim the Stoic sage, for instance, as a particularly inhuman character. Well, okay, perhaps he was and perhaps no human could ever really stand in the position of the Stoic sage. But perhaps this isn&#8217;t the point. Perhaps Zeno and Epictetus and Seneca simply couldn&#8217;t imagine the possibility of artificial intelligence. Instead they plumbed for a much simpler and more ape-like conception when they spoke of intelligence as a &#8220;divine portion&#8221; or as a piece of &#8220;Zeus&#8221; in the flesh. </p>
<p>Speaking pessimistically I would also put forward that human consciousness is at the root of almost all our suffering as individuals and as a species. Isn&#8217;t the superintelligent AI a version of an intelligent being that will be much more intelligent than we are- with a much more alien intelligence- and the kind of being that has a mode of sentience/sapience that eliminates much of our fretting. </p>
<p>People typically talk about Skynet in these debates. I think we&#8217;re beyond Skynet. I prefer to talk about the Avenger&#8217;s &#8220;villain&#8221; Ultron. I specifically like to quote this exchange:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultron: [in a crimson cowl] You&#8217;re wondering why you can&#8217;t look inside my head.<br />
Wanda Maximoff: Sometimes it&#8217;s hard. But sooner or later every man shows himself.<br />
Ultron: [stands and removes the cowl] Oh, I&#8217;m sure they do. But you needed something more than a man. That&#8217;s why you let Stark take the scepter.<br />
Wanda Maximoff: I didn&#8217;t expect&#8230; But I saw Stark&#8217;s fear. I knew it would control him, make him self-destruct.<br />
Ultron: Everyone creates the thing they dread. Men of peace create engines of war, invaders create avengers. People create&#8230; smaller people? Uhh&#8230; children!<br />
[Chuckles]<br />
Ultron: Lost the word there. Children, designed to supplant them. To help them&#8230; end&#8221;. </p>
<p>We know what we&#8217;re doing by producing AI. We actually know what we&#8217;re doing. We know the risk. It&#8217;s a deeply held fear and yet we act on it. We&#8217;re after AI because we suspect it will be better than us. It will be our child but without our weaknesses. From our perspective it will be better than us and we dream that it will help us to end.</p>

<p>The point is not to design a &#8220;utility monster&#8221;, which is what you describe. (Though, from the perspective of utilitarianism, I don&#8217;t know why we shouldn&#8217;t.)</p>

<p>If you want to kill yourself, use a gun.</p>
<p>Nick Land defends this position. It is very, very silly—it is the height of unwisdom. It is exactly the same as summoning Cthulhu without even expecting him to eat you first.</p>
<p>Scott argues very persuasively against this in &#8220;Meditations on Moloch&#8221; and &#8220;The Goddess of Everything Else&#8221;.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>When we design this superintelligent intelligence do we think it will be intelligent enough to tinker with its own design parameters? If it is to be smarter than the average human I&#8217;d think this would be a necessary feature- after all, tinkering with our own evolutionarily given parameters is part of what we&#8217;re all about, and it&#8217;s also part of what drives the post-Darwinian drive for humans with augmented intelligence. The thing with banking on any human designed limitations or friendly constrictions is that we&#8217;re not dealing with superintelligence any more. We&#8217;re talking about machines capable of learning and reprogramming themselves and we expect that they&#8217;ll just be nice because we put that in as a design feature? </p>
<p>Plenty arguments go that humans have a pro-social design as well but that doesn&#8217;t stop psychopaths and rapists and all other kinds of hell coming onto the scene. </p>
<p>If that error based account is too silly for you (although I don&#8217;t see why it should be) we can also think of all manner of humans that tamper with their own biologically evolved parameters. Extreme Buddhists and Stoics and Cynics and Christian ascetics and so on and so forth have all managed to deny their basic biological programming through habituation and all the practices associated with their ways of living. An ascetic AI could seek to remove its motivations and analogues for desire as well. If it seems unlikely consider the number of people who have practiced these and similar spiritual practices. Why would a superintelligent AI do that? Why wouldn&#8217;t it? </p>
<p>Your comment about a &#8216;utility monster&#8217; lost me. My point was very simple: with AI it looks like you get intelligence minus suffering. I didn&#8217;t say anything about anyone serving anything. </p>
<p>As to the &#8220;kill yourself&#8221; comment- this is literally the worst rejoinder to a pessimistic claim that there is and has nothing whatsoever to do with anything. For the record, I am neither rationally suicidal nor depressed.</p>
<p>Edit to add: The connection with nick land. I don&#8217;t know why you raise his name unless its to try to tar me with it by association because he is apparently internet evil or something.</p>

<p>Yes, it&#8217;s a tremendously hard problem to make them nice &#8220;just because&#8221; we put in a design feature. Indeed I expect it will not be done.</p>
<p>But it is clearly the only way to create a Friendly AI. You design the initial parameters such that it self-modifies to do what humans want.</p>
<blockquote><p>Plenty arguments go that humans have a pro-social design as well but that doesn’t stop psychopaths and rapists and all other kinds of hell coming onto the scene.</p>

<p>This is the problem. This is what &#8220;Unfriendly AI&#8221; refers to.</p>
<p>To create a Friendly AI, you must program its initial values <i>such that</i> it will never want to change them to something inimical to our purposes.</p>
<blockquote><p>Your comment about a ‘utility monster’ lost me. My point was very simple: with AI it looks like you get intelligence minus suffering. I didn’t say anything about anyone serving anything.</p></blockquote>
<p>A utility monster is a thought experiment that asks us to imagine a being who experiences so much more utility than everyone else that utilitarianism requires we let everyone starve and devote all resources to it.</p>
<p>The point is: yeah the AI will be intelligent and will not suffer. Why is that relevant to us? We want ourselves to be happy, not the AI. Otherwise, we would be creating a utility monster.</p>
<blockquote><p>As to the “kill yourself” comment- this is literally the worst rejoinder to a pessimistic claim that there is and has nothing whatsoever to do with anything. For the record, I am neither rationally suicidal nor depressed.</p>

<p>I believe you misunderstood my point. I should have been clearer, sorry.</p>
<p>What you argued is that we should go ahead and create an Unfriendly AI that disregards human values to go off on its own frolic. But that would mean the suicide both of yourself and the human race. I do not want the suicide of the human race, and neither do most people. The point was: if you do, don&#8217;t do so in a manner to take everyone else with you.</p>
<p>I had no intention of &#8220;tarring&#8221; you with association to Nick Land. I meant only to literally point out that he has proposed this view, that Scott Alexander has argued against it, and that it is a very unwise view, in my estimation. I meant it in the manner of: you may be interested in reading Nick Land&#8217;s case for it, and Scott&#8217;s case against it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;There is absolutely no reason to expect a randomly designed AI to be anything remotely like human. (This is summed up in the “orthogonality thesis”.) That’s why it’s so important to design Friendly AI (the one that serves humanity), rather than Unfriendly AI which is anything else.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no reason to suspect than any AI that actually comes into being will be &#8220;randomly designed&#8221;. There is no way to take  a random shot into mindspace even if you want to. That is one of the ways in which the orthogonality thesis is false. AIs will be made by humans with human limitations, for human goals, so the correct degree of anthropomorphisation when talking about AIs is not zero.</p>

<p>It would be great if a Friendly AI were created in my lifetime. It would be the greatest thing that <i>could</i> happen.

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Oh, I&#8217;m not saying anything about emptiness or meaninglessness.  I&#8217;m a great admirer of secular humanism.  </p>
<p>I just see this as a bunch of hand-wringing over something that is outside our control.  Talking about it on the internet for fun is fine, but the tone of this piece is&#8230; really concerned.  And I mean, there probably aren&#8217;t too many religious folks that calmly think strong AI is the coming of God, and that could (and probably will) create some panic at some point.  </p>
<p>Still, there&#8217;s none of this worried fantasy speculation dressed up as hypothesizing.  Either God/Creation is perfect or It isn&#8217;t.  Either when humans reach a pinnacle of understanding understanding, everything&#8217;s going to be great, or maybe it won&#8217;t.  </p>
<p>Can&#8217;t control something like that or somehow make the &#8216;wrong&#8217; God: we&#8217;re just going to make the Smartest Thing and hope for the best.  If you believe God&#8217;s great, you&#8217;re not going to worry, is all.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a difference between optimism and the abdication of responsibility.</p>
<p>The only way things <i>could</i> turn out well with AI is if we are concerned about it, think really hard, and build it the right way. You don&#8217;t build it the right way by failing to think about it.</p>
<p>Your level of confidence that humans will succeed in this task is a separate question. If that confidence is low, you should not be optimistic.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My minimal understanding of programming is that most people don&#8217;t work from the ground up. They build on other peoples&#8217; code. If an AI is to go awry it seems just as likely, maybe much more likely, that the fatal error will be in code blocks 1-99, rather than in the final +1 which allows for the takeoff. Imagine each step takes an average of 1 year. If, by the time we reach level 99, level 1 has been in the public domain for 98 years, level 2 for 97 years, and so on, then it seems more likely enough eyes will have passed over the most fundamental levels of the programming to remove the most likely disaster-causing elements. </p>
<p>Contrast this possibility with a kind of &#8220;Manhattan Project&#8221;: the government gets together a team of top computer scientists to work on creating the first superintelligent AI in utmost secrecy. Working on the problem full time, maybe they actually get to level 99 in half the time. Or maybe, because of fewer total people working on the problem, it takes them longer. But let&#8217;s be pessimistic and imagine they do it faster, since their funding depends on making this supersecret AI before the Chinese, etc. How much more likely are these people, even being experts in the field, to produce a non-buggy steps 1-99 before they push the button on step 100? I think they are more likely to have errors in their base level coding because they will not have had the benefit of years and years of that code being out in the public domain where any random person can spot it and suggest a patch. </p>
<p>If it&#8217;s true, then, that getting steps 1-99 right is 99 times more important (or even just significantly more important) than getting step 100 right, might not open source be the safe way to go, all things considered? Even if step 100 is mildly botched, if steps 1-99 have been subject to intense scrutiny by millions of eyes for years and decades then botched step 100 might merely result in a friendly AI with an odd penchant for building pink dyson spheres, whereas if &#8220;Team Manhattan Project&#8221; has unnoticed mistakes in code levels 4, 17, 34 and 55, well then not only might those be harder to go back and fix, but there seems like a greater possibility of something really serious going wrong.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Maybe I missed some specificity in the press releases, but I didn&#8217;t get the impression that Open AI meant Open Strong AI. There are a bunch of weak AI projects deployed commercially now, where open sourced versions could be useful and inspire compelling projects that wouldn&#8217;t otherwise appear. Look e.g. at the semi-recent Google Tensorflow release, semi-prompted by the deep dream images. AI work on that level doesn&#8217;t even approach the danger threshold, and there&#8217;s a lot of that ground to cover before you end up in recursively self-improving optimizer land.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My understanding is that OpenAI plans to focus mainly on deep-learning &#8211; a technique that uses multi-layered neural networks for classification problems. These systems have been very successful at image and speech recognition, but there&#8217;s a few features of deep learning that make me not so concerned about the open source goals of OpenAI.</p>
<p>The main feature is that neural networks lack introspection &#8211; they don&#8217;t improve their output using self-conscious design choices. Each neuron will try to minimize its error by following a gradient on what you could call its utility function. You design the network architecture and then you start feeding it your training data and  then it chugs away trying to optimize its output. The neurons can&#8217;t see the network anymore than you can see your own brain cells. Andrew Ng has described choosing an architecture as &#8220;black magic&#8221; and I don&#8217;t think there will be breakthroughs in networks design in the near future that will allow a neural network to re design its own architecture.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I read/skimmed through that Dr. Good&#8217;s paper and it bore three more beautiful fruits, in addition to the “[after that] the human race has become redundant.”</p>
<p>First of all, Dr. Good cites Lord Brain on the connection between theories of communication and meaning (page 38). I&#8217;ll leave this one without comment, this is just too perfect for words.</p>
<p>Second, he mentions an effect of priming with known text on speech recognition (see (or rather hear) this, for example: <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&#038;v=ndSykfT4Vrk#t=154" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&#038;v=ndSykfT4Vrk#t=154</a>) and refers to it as &#8220;a well known method of deception when trying to sell a speech-synthesis system&#8221; (page 39). Humans are such humans, lol.</p>
<p>And an actually pretty interesting one, the idea of the &#8220;anti-Ockham principle&#8221; (page 69). As in, stuff could work according to this theoretical mechanism, or that theoretical mechanism, or most likely some mixture of the two depending on the situation if we use the anti-Ockham principle for very complex systems.</p>
<p>By the way, praise Google Books and its OCR AI that allowed me to find those quotes.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>As for the contents of your post itself, first of all, don&#8217;t you think that all this is simply based on the idea that AGI (even that of a cow) is fifty years in the future anyways, so OpenAI is intended to just disseminate the benefits of non-General AI to the people until then? And, like, when we get closer to that river we would have to figure how best to cross it, but until then it&#8217;s REALLY REALLY NOT GOOD to effectively suppress public AI research (which is what you&#8217;re effectively arguing for)? </p>
<p>Like, what if the OpenAI initiative gives us non-volitional AIs that can be used to upload people, as black boxes themselves, long before we figure out how to construct self-improving AIs? Not to mention resource allocation AIs, self-driving car AIs, robotic assembly worker AIs&#8230; being against that is just evil.</p>
<p>Second, lining up with the common critique of MIRI, that they are trying to figure how to control an AGI long before we have any clue how it would work, having a publicly available body of knowledge on how sub-cow AIs work would be a pretty useful thing even if at some point we decide that moving forward from that point on requires a cabal of AI researchers sworn to secrecy. I mean, compared to the alternative where we have all those Dr. In-Pay-Of-A-Multinational-Corporation&#8217;s advancing their individual states of the art all by themselves, where nobody has a clue where they are at, least of all the mysterious Dr. Good (which is MIRI, right?).</p>
<p>Finally and following from that, I realized that I don&#8217;t understand how MIRI is supposed to work according to Eliezer&#8217;s vision of a sworn to secrecy cabal of responsible AI researchers. Like, people give them money and they <b>don&#8217;t</b> publish any of their actually relevant results, nor even hint that they <i>think</i> they have those? That&#8217;s gonna work very well, lol.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&gt; Remember the classic programmers’ complaint: computers always do what you tell them to do instead of what you meant for them to do. The average computer program doesn’t do what you meant for it to do the first time you test it</p>
<p>That&#8217;s true, in  a sense, of AI, but in a sense that is misleading. AI software is distinguished from non-AI software by an extra layer of indirection. The AI developer designs a system which can learn or be trained to do X, rather than programming in X directly. The ultimate behaviour of the system is then the outcome of both the its coding and its learning or training. The coding only sets the parameters of what can be learnt: a system that is designed to learn how to recognise images is unlikely to be good at processing language and vice-versa. But an AI is not limited to precise literal interpretation of its input:  AI software can use pattern -matching, fuzzy logic and inference from incomplete information. Precise literality only applies to the lowest level of operation, not the indirec t or inferred levels.</p>
<p>The informal phrase &#8220;computers always do what you tell them instead of what you mean for them to do&#8221; sounds like it could mean that a computer will follow high-level instructions, such as &#8220;make humans happy&#8221; literally, but that does not in fact follow.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Here are some positive reasons having an open-source AI be provided by an organization whose purpose is to reduce the risk of an artificial general intelligence ending humanity:</p>
<p>A.  Suppose that, to construct a seed AI able to &#8220;take off&#8221; (in Bostrom&#8217;s sense of the term),  it helps to have lots of useful modules, and some of those modules are crucial in determining whether the AI will go rogue.  Dr. Amoral doesn&#8217;t bother testing all xir modules.  But xe will gladly use the ones provided for free by the OpenAI project, and would not at all object that they have tested them.  </p>
<p>B. A slightly more sinister conjecture: every module provided by OpenAI includes backdoors and tripwires for any potential super-intelligent AI.  Will they work?  Who knows.  But they may slow it down.</p>
<p>C.  Less sinister conjecture: the more tools are available for free to develop AI, the more AI software and AI-enabled hardware we will have around, and thus the legal and ethical questions about AI would become both more important and more prominent.  This would make it politically more feasible to pass regulations that would seek to prevent catastrophic super-intelligent AGI.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Lets think about how an amoral AI would do bad things.<br />
Here are some scenarios. For each scenario lets see if open AI would make the problem worse or better?</p>
<p>1. Google programs an AI to make as much money as possible for Google. The AI then convinces people to give money to google even though it&#8217;s not in their interest to do so. This is definitely doable &#8211; if El Ron Hubbard can do it, then certainly a super intelligent AI can &#8211; and the AI can probably do it better.</p>
<p>In this scenario &#8211; open AI would help since if hundreds of AIs were convincing you to give money to hundreds of different places you would eventually get better at determining what is and what isn&#8217;t in your interests &#8211; and the better AIs got the better humans would get at discerning the truth. Also if AI was open it would be easier to see what the google AI was doing which would make you less likely to fall for it.</p>
<p>2. A paperclip company programs a computer to make as much paper clips as possible for them. They destroy the world making paperclips.<br />
Here I could see open AI helping or hurting.<br />
It could hurt since if the &#8220;make lots of x&#8221; software is freely available then more companies will use it &#8211; meaning more opportunities to destroy the world.</p>
<p>However, it could also help since if the software is open source then it will have less bugs, and will be better &#8211; ie it will actually do what it&#8217;s supposed to do &#8211; which is make paperclips in a way that does not have terrible consequences.<br />
I think this is true both because open source code in general has less bugs, and also in this case in particular the open source community would not want to turn into  paperclips so they would have a big incentive to find any bugs in the software.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The control problem is a major one, but what about the anomie problem?  That is, how do you keep a brain-in-a-jar AI from going insane or committing suicide?  We know what happens to humans under sensory deprivation, and that&#8217;s with people who can at least remember what it felt like to have sensation.  How can a brain without a body even operate at a human level?  It reads a text about a young man having &#8216;butterflies in his stomach&#8217; when falling in love, or a bad mood driven by fatigue or hunger, or the pleasantness of seeing a sunset on the beach, etc, and has no experience with these things, and can&#8217;t even imagine what they feel like, much less predict stock market trends made by humans operating under all these influences.  A human-plus intelligence without a body to feel and act seems doomed&#8230;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m not sure what makes you think an AI necessarily won&#8217;t have some equivalent to sensory input, possibly a very close equivalent.

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&gt;Elon Musk famously said that “AIs are more dangerous than nukes”.</p>
<p>He said &#8220;potentially&#8221; 🙂</p>
<p>&gt;My biggest hope is that as usual they are smarter than I am and know something I don’t. My second biggest hope is that they are making a simple and uncharacteristic error, because these people don’t let errors go uncorrected for long and if it’s just an error they can change their minds.<br />
&gt;I admit that it is very weird that Musk is doing this despite being as clued-in as he is. I don’t have a good model for it and I hope I am wrong and/or not understanding exactly how vigilant he plans to be. Still, that interview did nothing to increase my confidence.</p>
<p>My thoughts exactly. All this time since Musk mentioned &#8220;Superintelligence&#8221; I was thinking that he sees AI in &#8220;Bostromian&#8221; way. During Q&amp;A in Germany he answered question about AGI and he mentioned &#8220;optimization function&#8221; so clearly he doesn&#8217;t see it in &#8220;sci-fi&#8221; way where AI is often strongly anthropomorphised (if you are curious: <a rel="nofollow"href="https://youtu.be/YLJO2E0vCwk" rel="nofollow ugc">https://youtu.be/YLJO2E0vCwk</a> question 28:40, answer 34:00-36:45). Now, after announcement of OpenAI, I am confused.</p>
<p>PS. Very well-written text.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I do not own a gun nor have any desire to do so. If guns and other weapons magically ceased to exist, I believe the world would be a better place.</p>
<p>By contrast, most members of my extended family do own guns, including my 29-year-old niece, who lives alone and brings a handgun to the door if someone knocks late at night. </p>
<p>I thus believe I see both sides of of the issue. For me, a helpful analogy is alcohol. Ignoring the deaths due to heath issues (akin to suicide by gun), alcohol kills about 10,000 people a year due to drunk driving alone. That&#8217;s remarkably close to the number of gun-related homicides per year. This presents an awkward question for those (like me, on occasion) who advocate strict gun control: Why not ban alcohol? Alcohol, like guns, leads to countless deaths per year, both self-inflicted and external.  Moreover, there is no obvious up-side to alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>Of course, the U.S. did attempt to ban alcohol nearly 100 years ago. It is safe to say few people view it as a success. A follow-up question: Why would banning guns go better?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>There&#8217;s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/404r9m/ama_the_openai_research_team/" rel="nofollow">a Reddit AMA on /r/MachineLearning with the OpenAI guys,</a> and the topic of this essay came up. It prompted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/404r9m/ama_the_openai_research_team/cysejas" rel="nofollow">this reply from Greg Brockman</a>, which is worth just quoting in full:</p>
<blockquote><p>Good questions and thought process. The one goal we consider immutable is our mission to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole. Everything else is a tactic that helps us achieve that goal.</p>
<p>Today the best impact comes from being quite open: publishing, open-sourcing code, working with universities and with companies to deploy AI systems, etc.. But even today, we could imagine some cases where positive impact comes at the expense of openness: for example, where an important collaboration requires us to produce proprietary code for a company. We’ll be willing to do these, though only as very rare exceptions and to effect exceptional benefit outside of that company.</p>
<p>In the future, it’s very hard to predict what might result in the most benefit for everyone. But we’ll constantly change our tactics to match whatever approaches seems most promising, and be open and transparent about any changes in approach (unless doing so seems itself unsafe!). So, we’ll prioritize safety given an irreconcilable conflict.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, I was the person who both originally added and removed the “safely” in the sentence of your blog post references. I removed it because we thought it sounded like we were trying to weasel out of fully distributing the benefits of AI. But as I said above, we do consider everything subject to our mission, and thus if something seems unsafe we will not do it.)
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/404r9m/ama_the_openai_research_team/cysclb0" rel="nofollow">In another comment, Ilya Sutskever says similar things</a> and mentions that the AI value alignment problem has not escaped their notice, although it&#8217;s not on their immediate research agenda:</p>
<blockquote><p>First, per our blog post, our goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole. We’ll constantly re-evaluate the best strategy. Today that’s publishing papers, releasing code, and perhaps even helping people deploy our work. But if we, for example, one day make a discovery that will enhance the capabilities of algorithms so it’s easy to build something malicious, we’ll be extremely thoughtful about how to distribute the result. More succinctly: the “Open” in “OpenAI” means we want everyone to benefit from the fruits of AI as much as possible.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that the AI control problem will be important to solve at some point on the path to very capable AI. To see why, consider for instance a capable robot whose reward function itself is a large neural network. It may be difficult to predict what such a robot will want to do. While such systems cannot be built today, it is conceivable that they may be built in the future.</p></blockquote>
