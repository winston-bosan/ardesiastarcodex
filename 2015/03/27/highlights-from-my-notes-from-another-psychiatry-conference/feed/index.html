I&#039;ve read about that - it is an interesting study, but while there are interesting reports as to how the non-crazy people felt in that situation, that wasn&#039;t what they were studying.

I&#039;m not at all surprised that the real patients could spot them. For all that psychs love to talk about us &#039;lacking insight&#039; I&#039;ve found far more useful insight, advice and basically informal therapy* from other crazies than any psychiatric professional has been able to give me.

I don&#039;t mean to malign Scott&#039;s profession here - or at least, not him by association, as he sounds like exactly the guy I would want dealing with my head - but there are serious problems here.

* in the sense that the distinction between &#039;some crazies drink non-alcoholic beer, bitch about their shrinks and generally talk openly about stuff&#039; and &#039;group therapy&#039; is not one that I find particularly meaningful.]]></description>

The difference between the US and parliamentary democracies is that individual candidates are pretty much on their own here.  Each candidate&#039;s campaign committee does its own separate fund raising effort.

The APA probably does give to &quot;both sides&quot; in the sense that they give to expected winners in both parties.  They presumably avoid giving any money to candidates in either party who are not likely to win.

(Note that due to gerrymandering and regional variations in party strength, almost every district is safely Republican or safely Democratic.  Few members of the Michigan Legislature face meaningful opposition from the other party.  Other states are similar.)

So, yes, I expect that their statistic is literally true, that 95% of their contributions end up in the hands of winning campaigns.]]></description>

There&#039;s one consolation: There&#039;s little the NSA can&#039;t do, but there&#039;s still a lot they can&#039;t do &lt;i&gt;without risking detection&lt;/i&gt;. If your phone turns on, starts recording, and uses the internet connection, that is extremely detectable. 

And thankfully, there are people out there, like Wikileaks and friends, who are very good at monitoring such suspicious behavior, and telling us about it.

Spy agencies&#039; capabilities are, as always, limited by what they risk by using the capabilities they have. Neither of us are probably important enough to warrant &lt;i&gt;targeted&lt;/i&gt; surveillance (though I was on my guard for a while after &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/17/edward-snowden-nsa-files-whistleblower#block-51bf2d46e4b0d3c142583379&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Snowden replied to my question&lt;/a&gt; about civil disobedience). In the event that we are spied upon, we have more potential to cause damage by catching them in the act, than they have to win by spying on us.

Mass surveillance, though, is another matter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I was institutionalised as a psychiatric patient, there were a lot of things the staff did that seemed, at the time, calculated to make me more paranoid and crazy. And obviously the trouble with that mindset is that it&#039;s recursive - the more you worry that they seem to be trying to make you more paranoid the more you think you sound crazy and paranoid, the more you worry about being crazy and paranoid.

In actuality, their behaviour was probably more a consequence of assuming I was more crazy than I was (or at least, that the cause of a statement or behaviour couldn&#039;t be something other than my craziness).

Specifically, they:

Denied the existence of silverfish (bugs) in a hospital room when I pointed them out, and only when a nurse huffily agreed to come with me to confirm that I was just seeing things did she admit that they were real.

When I was permitted to go on a walk with my mum who was visiting, obviously didn&#039;t believe me about some of the dry grass in the car park smoking as if about to catch fire from the sun/heat. I presume someone later caught this as the car park didn&#039;t burn down, but the point is my non-crazy mum saw it too and refusing to believe me and telling me I was seeing things just made me feel more crazy and as if they were trying to make me crazy.

When I heard am alarm go off, insisted that I hadn&#039;t heard anything instead of explaining when asked what it was for.

So, I&#039;m kind of not surprised by these ideas. 

I mean, psychiatric hospital itself is an environment where people are watching you and recording your behaviour all the time while refusing to explain to you why or show you what they&#039;re writing - it&#039;s like it&#039;s tailor-made to make you more paranoid.

Edit: Proposed experiment - treat neurotypical people the way psychiatric inpatients are treated and see how long it takes for them to develop paranoia.]]></description>

In fact, we should just turn society over to the economists. Lots of economists seems to think it&#039;s a good idea, and who am I to disagree?

On an exhibit on the brain in the local Science museum, they had a claw machine, of the kind they have in tivolis, but picking up foamy rubber brains instead of teddy bears. Not sure if it was the same type of stress brain, but they did have some medical corporation&#039;s logo on them. 

You could try as many times as you wanted, and you also had free access to the difficulty setting part of the machine. They weren&#039;t conducting addiction research on us, although I think the allusion was deliberate.]]></description>
