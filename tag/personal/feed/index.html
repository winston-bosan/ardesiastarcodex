I&#8217;m being deliberately vague in places because I don&#8217;t want to condemn anything specific without being able to prove anything.]</i></font></p>
<p><b>September 2014</b></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a screening test for bipolar disorder. You ask patients a bunch of things like &#8220;Do you ever feel really happy, then really sad?&#8221;. If they say &#8216;yes&#8217; to enough of these questions, you start to worry.</p>
<p>Some psychiatrists love this test. I hate it. Patients will say &#8220;Yes, that absolutely describes me!&#8221; and someone will diagnose them with bipolar disorder. Then if you ask what they meant, they&#8217;d say something like &#8220;Once my local football team made it to the Super Bowl and I was really happy, but then they lost and I was really sad.&#8221; I don&#8217;t even want to tell you how many people get diagnosed bipolar because of stuff like this.</p>
<p>There was a study that supposedly proved this test worked. But parts of it confused me, and it was done on a totally different population that didn&#8217;t generalize to hospital inpatients. Also, it said in big letters THIS IS JUST A SCREENING TEST IT IS NOT INTENDED FOR DIAGNOSIS, and everyone was using it for diagnosis.</p>
<p>So I complained to some sympathetic doctors and professors, and they asked &#8220;Why not do a study?&#8221;</p>
<p>Why <i>not</i> do a study? Why not join the great tradition of scientists, going back to Galileo and Newton, and make my mark on the world? Why not replace my griping about bipolar screening with an experiment about bipolar screening, an experiment done to the highest standards of the empirical tradition, one that would throw the entire weight of the scientific establishment behind my complaint? I&#8217;d been writing about science for so long, even doing my own informal experiments, why not move on to join the big leagues?</p>
<p>For (it would turn out) a whole host of excellent reasons that I was about to learn.</p>
<p>A spring in my step, I journeyed to my hospital&#8217;s Research Department, hidden in a corner office just outside the orthopaedic ward. It was locked, as always. After enough knocking, a lady finally opened the door and motioned for me to sit down at a paperwork-filled desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to do a study,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>She looked skeptical. &#8220;Have you done the Pre-Study Training?&#8221;</p>
<p>I had to admit I hadn&#8217;t, so off I went. The training was several hours of videos about how the Nazis had done unethical human experiments. Then after World War II, everybody met up and decided to only do ethical human experiments from then on. And the most important part of being ethical was to have all experiments monitored by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) made of important people who could check whether experiments were ethical or not. I dutifully parroted all this back on the post-test (&#8220;Blindly trusting authority to make our ethical decisions for us is the <i>best</i> way to separate ourselves from the Nazis!&#8221;) and received my Study Investigator Certification. </p>
<p>I went back to the corner office, Study Investigator Certification in hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to do a study,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>The lady still looked skeptical. &#8220;Do you have a Principal Investigator?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mere resident doctors weren&#8217;t allowed to do studies on their own. They would probably screw up and start building concentration camps or something. They needed an attending (high-ranking doctor) to sign on as Principal Investigator before the IRB would deign to hear their case.</p>
<p>I knew exactly how to handle this: one by one, I sought out the laziest attendings in the hospital and asked &#8220;Hey, would you like to have your name on a study as Principal Investigator for free while I do all the actual work?&#8221; Yet one by one, all of the doctors refused, as if I was offering them some kind of plague basket full of vermin. It was the weirdest thing.</p>
<p>Finally, there was only one doctor left &#8211; Dr. W, the hardest-working attending I knew, the one who out of some weird masochistic impulse took on every single project anyone asked of him and micromanaged it to perfection, the one who every psychiatrist in the whole hospital (including himself) had diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure Scott,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;I&#8217;d be happy to serve as your Principal Investigator&#8221;. </p>
<p>A feeling of dread in my stomach, I walked back to the tiny corner office.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to do a study,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>The lady still looked skeptical. &#8220;Have you completed the New Study Application?&#8221; She gestured to one of the stacks of paperwork filling the room.</p>
<p>It started with a section on my research question. Next was a section on my proposed methodology. A section on possible safety risks. A section on recruitment. A section on consent. A section on&#8230;wow. Surely this can&#8217;t <i>all</i> be the New Study Application? Maybe I accidentally picked up the Found A New Hospital Application?</p>
<p>I asked the lady who worked in the tiny corner office whether, since I was just going to be asking bipolar people whether they ever felt happy and then sad, maybe I could get the short version of the New Study Application?</p>
<p>She told me that <i>was</i> the short version.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s twenty-two pages!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t done any studies before, have you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rather than confess my naivete, I started filling out the twenty-two pages of paperwork. It started by asking about our study design, which was simple: by happy coincidence, I was assigned to Dr. W&#8217;s inpatient team for the next three months. When we got patients, I would give them the bipolar screening exam and record the results. Then Dr. W. would conduct a full clinical interview and formally assess them. We&#8217;d compare notes and see how often the screening test results matched Dr. W&#8217;s expert diagnosis. We usually got about twenty new patients a week; if half of them were willing and able to join our study, we should be able to gather about a hundred data points over the next three months. It was going to be easy-peasy.</p>
<p>That was the first ten pages or so of the Application. The rest was increasingly bizarre questions such as &#8220;Will any organs be removed from participants during this study?&#8221; (Look, I promise, I&#8217;m not a Nazi). </p>
<p>And: &#8220;Will prisoners be used in the study?&#8221; (COME ON, I ALREADY SAID I WASN&#8217;T A NAZI). </p>
<p>And: &#8220;What will you do if a participant dies during this research?&#8221; (If somebody dies while I&#8217;m asking them whether they sometimes feel happy and then sad, I really can&#8217;t even promise so much as &#8220;not freaking out&#8221;, let alone any sort of dignified research procedure). </p>
<p>And more questions, all along the same lines. I double-dog swore to give everybody really, really good consent forms. I tried my best to write a list of the risks participants were taking upon themselves (mostly getting paper cuts on the consent forms). I argued that these compared favorably to the benefits (maybe doctors will stop giving people strong psychiatric medications just because their football team made the Super Bowl).</p>
<p>When I was done, I went back to the corner office and submitted everything to the Institutional Review Board. Then I sat back and hoped for the best. Like an idiot.</p>
<p><b>October 2014</b></p>
<p>The big day arrived. The IRB debated the merits of my study, examined the risks, and&#8230;sent me a letter pointing out several irregularities in my consent forms.</p>
<p>IRREGULARITY #1: Consent forms traditionally included the name of the study in big letters where the patient could see it before signing. Mine didn&#8217;t. Why not?</p>
<p>Well, because in questionnaire-based psychological research, you <i>never</i> tell the patient what you&#8217;re looking for before they fill out the questionnaire. That&#8217;s like Methods 101. The name of my study was &#8220;Validity Of A Screening Instrument For Bipolar Disorder&#8221;. Tell the patient it&#8217;s a study about bipolar disorder, and the gig is up.</p>
<p>The IRB listened patiently to my explanation, then told me that this was not a legitimate reason not to put the name of the study in big letters on the consent form. Putting the name of the study on the consent form was important. You know who <i>else</i> didn&#8217;t put the name of the study on his consent forms? <i>Hitler.</i></p>
<p>IRREGULARITY #2: Consent forms traditionally included a paragraph about the possible risks of the study and a justification for why we believed that the benefits were worth the risks. Everyone else included a paragraph about this on our consent forms, and read it to their patients before getting their consent. We didn&#8217;t have one. Why not?</p>
<p>Well, for one thing, because all we were doing was asking them whether they felt happy and then sad sometimes. This is the sort of thing that goes on every day in a psychiatric hospital. Heck, the other psychiatrists were using this same screening test, except <i>for real</i>, and they never had to worry about whether it had risks. In the grand scheme of things, this just wasn&#8217;t a very risky procedure. </p>
<p>Also, psychiatric patients are sometimes&#8230;how can I put this nicely?&#8230;a little paranoid. Sometimes you can offer them breakfast and they&#8217;ll accuse you of trying to poison them. I had no illusions that I would get every single patient to consent to this study, but I felt like I could at least avoid handing them a paper saying &#8220;BY THE WAY, THIS STUDY IS FULL OF RISKS&#8221;.</p>
<p>The IRB listened patiently to my explanation, then told me that this was not a legitimate reason not to have a paragraph about risks. We should figure out some risks, then write a paragraph explaining how those were definitely the risks and we took them very seriously. The other psychiatrists who used this test every day didn&#8217;t have to do that <i>because they weren&#8217;t running a study</i>.</p>
<p>IRREGULARITY #3: Signatures are traditionally in pen. But we said our patients would sign in pencil. Why?</p>
<p>Well, because psychiatric patients aren&#8217;t allowed to have pens in case they stab themselves with them. I don&#8217;t get why stabbing yourself with a pencil is any less of a problem, but the rules are the rules. We asked the hospital administration for a one-time exemption, to let our patients have pens just long enough to sign the consent form. Hospital administration said absolutely not, and they didn&#8217;t care if this sabotaged our entire study, it was pencil or nothing.</p>
<p>The IRB listened patiently to all this, then said that it had to be in pen. You know who <i>else</i> had people sign consent forms in pencil&#8230;?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m definitely not saying that these were the only three issues the IRB sprung on Dr. W and me. I&#8217;m saying these are a <i>representative sample</i>. I&#8217;m saying I spent several weeks relaying increasingly annoyed emails and memos from myself to Dr. W to the IRB to the lady in the corner office to the IRB again. I began to come home later in the evening. My relationships suffered. I started having dreams about being attacked by giant consent forms filled out in pencil.</p>
<p>I was about ready to give up at this point, but Dr. W insisted on combing through various regulations and talking to various people, until he discovered some arcane rule that certain very safe studies with practically no risk were allowed to use an &#8220;expedited consent form&#8221;, which was a lot like a normal consent form but didn&#8217;t need to have things like the name of the study on it. Faced with someone even more obsessive and bureaucratic than they were, the IRB backed down and gave us preliminary permission to start our study. </p>
<p>The next morning, screening questionnaire in hand, I showed up at the hospital and hoped for the best. Like an idiot.</p>
<p><b>November 2014</b></p>
<p>Things progressed slowly. It turns out a lot of psychiatric inpatients are either depressed, agitated, violent, or out of touch with reality, and none of these are really conducive to wanting to participate in studies. A few of them already delusionally thought we were doing experiments on them, and got confused when we suddenly asked them to consent. Several of them made it clear that they hated us and wanted to thwart us in any way possible. After a week, I only had three data points, instead of the ten I&#8217;d been banking on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Data points&#8221; makes it sound abstract. It wasn&#8217;t. I had hoped to put the results in the patients&#8217; easily accessible online chart, <i>the same place everyone else put the results of the exact same bipolar screening test</i> when they did it for real. They would put it in a section marked TEST RESULTS, which was there to have a secure place where you could put test results, and where everybody&#8217;s secure test results were kept.</p>
<p>The IRB would have none of this. Study data are Confidential and need to be kept Secure. Never mind that all the patients&#8217; <i>other</i> secure test results were on the online chart. Never mind that the online chart contains all sorts of stuff about the patients&#8217; diagnoses, medications, hopes and fears, and even (remember, this is a psych hospital) secret fetishes and sexual perversions. Study data needed to be encrypted, then kept in a Study Binder in a locked drawer in a locked room that nobody except the study investigators had access to.</p>
<p>The first problem was that nobody wanted to give us a locked room that nobody except us had access to. There was a sort of All Purpose Psychiatry Paperwork room, but the janitors went in to clean it out every so often, and apparently this made it unacceptable. Hospitals aren&#8217;t exactly drowning in spare rooms that not even janitors can get into. Finally Dr. W grudgingly agreed to keep it in his office. This frequently meant I couldn&#8217;t access any of the study material because Dr. W was having important meetings that couldn&#8217;t be interrupted by a resident barging into his office to rummage in his locked cabinets. </p>
<p>But whatever. The bigger problem was the encryption. There was a very specific way we had to do it. We would have a Results Log, that said things like &#8220;Patient 1 got a score of 11.5 on the test&#8221;. And then we&#8217;d have a Secret Patient Log, which would say things like &#8220;Patient 1 = Bob Johnson from Oakburg.&#8221; That way nobody could steal our results and figure out that Bob was sometimes happy, then sad.</p>
<p>(meanwhile, all of Bob&#8217;s actual diagnoses, sexual fetishes, etc were in the easily-accessible secure online chart that we were banned from using)</p>
<p>And then &#8211; I swear this is true &#8211; we had to keep the Results Log and the Secret Patient Log right next to each other in the study binder in the locked drawer in the locked room. </p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t sure I was understanding this part right, so I asked Dr. W whether it made sense, to him, that we put a lot of effort writing our results in code, and then put the key to the code in the same place as the enciphered text. He cheerfully agreed this made no sense, but said we had to do it or else our study would fail an audit and get shut down.</p>
<p><b>January 2015</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;d planned to get a hundred data points in three months. Thanks to constant bureaucratic hurdles, plus patients being less cooperative than I expected, I had about twenty-five. Now I was finishing my rotation on Dr. W&#8217;s team and going to a clinic far away. What now?</p>
<p>A bunch of newbies were going to be working with Dr. W for the next three months. I hunted them down and threatened and begged them until one of them agreed to keep giving patients the bipolar screening test in exchange for being named as a co-author. Disaster averted, I thought. Like an idiot.</p>
<p>Somehow news of this arrangement reached the lady in the corner office, who asked whether the new investigator had completed her Pre-Study Training. I protested that she wasn&#8217;t designing the study, she wasn&#8217;t conducting any analyses, all she was doing was asking her patients the same questions that she would be asking them anyway as part of her job for the next three months. The only difference was that she was recording them and giving them to me.</p>
<p>The lady in the corner office wasn&#8217;t impressed. You know who <i>else</i> hadn&#8217;t thought his lackeys needed to take courses in research ethics?</p>
<p>So the poor newbie took a course on how Nazis were bad. Now she could help with the study, right? </p>
<p>Wrong. We needed to submit a New Investigator Form to the IRB and wait for their approval.</p>
<p>Two and a half months later, the IRB returned their response: Newbie was good to go. She collected data for the remaining two weeks of her rotation with Dr. W before being sent off to another clinic just like I was.</p>
<p><b>July 2015</b></p>
<p>Dr. W and I planned ahead. We had figured out which newbies would be coming in to work for Dr. W three months ahead of time, and gotten them through the don&#8217;t-be-a-Nazi course and the IRB approval process just in time for them to start their rotation. Success!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we received another communication from the IRB. Apparently we were allowed to use the expedited consent form to get consent for our <i>study</i>, but not to get consent to <i>access protected health information</i>. That one required a whole different consent form, list-of-risks and all. We were right back where we&#8217;d started from.</p>
<p>I made my case to the Board. My case was: we&#8217;re not looking at any protected health information, f@#k you.</p>
<p>The Board answered that we were accessing the patient&#8217;s final diagnosis. It said right in the protocol, we were giving them the screening test, then comparing it to the patient&#8217;s final diagnosis. &#8220;Psychiatric diagnosis&#8221; sure <i>sounds</i> like protected health information.</p>
<p>I said no, you don&#8217;t understand, we&#8217;re the psychiatrists. Dr. W is the one making the final diagnosis. When I&#8217;m on Dr. W&#8217;s team, I&#8217;m in the room when he does the diagnostic interview, half the time I&#8217;m the one who types the final diagnosis into the chart. These are <i>our patients</i>.</p>
<p>The Board said this didn&#8217;t matter. We, as the patient&#8217;s doctors, would make the diagnosis and write it down on the chart. But we (as study investigators) needed a full signed consent form before we were allowed to access the diagnosis we had just made.</p>
<p>I said wait, you&#8217;re telling us we have to do this whole bureaucratic rigamarole with all of these uncooperative patients before we&#8217;re allowed to see something we wrote ourselves?</p>
<p>The Board said yes, exactly.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t remember this part very well, except that I think I half-heartedly trained whichever poor newbie we were using that month in how to take a Protected Health Information Consent on special Protected Health Information Consent Forms, and she nodded her head and said she understood. I think I had kind of clocked out at this point. I was going off to work all the way over in a different town for a year, and I was just sort of desperately hoping that Dr. W and various newbies would take care of things on their own and then in a year when I came back to the hospital I would have a beautiful pile of well-sorted data to analyze. Surely trained doctors would be able to ask simple questions from a screening exam on their own without supervision, I thought. Like an idiot.</p>
<p><b>July 2016</b></p>
<p>I returned to my base hospital after a year doing outpatient work in another town. I felt energized, well-rested, and optimistic that the bipolar screening study I had founded so long ago had been prospering in my absence.</p>
<p>Obviously nothing remotely resembling this had happened. Dr. W had vaguely hoped that I was taking care of it. I had vaguely hoped that Dr. W was taking care of it. The various newbies whom we had strategically enlisted had either forgotten about it, half-heartedly screened one or two patients before getting bored, or else mixed up the growing pile of consent forms and releases and logs so thoroughly that we would have to throw out all their work. It had been a year and a half since the study had started, and we had 40 good data points.</p>
<p>The good news was that I was back in town and I could go back to screening patients myself again. Also, we had some particularly enthusiastic newbies who seemed really interested in helping out and getting things right. Over the next three months, our sample size shot up, first to 50, then to 60, finally to 70. Our goal of 100 was almost in sight. The worst was finally behind me, I hoped. Like an idiot.</p>
<p><b>November 2016</b></p>
<p>I got an email saying our study was going to be audited.</p>
<p>It was nothing personal. Some higher-ups in the nationwide hospital system had decided to audit every study in our hospital. We were to gather all our records, submit them to the auditor, and hope for the best.</p>
<p>Dr. W, who was obsessive-compulsive at the best of times, became unbearable. We got into late-night fights over the number of dividers in the study binder. We hunted down every piece of paper that had ever been associated with anyone involved in the study in any way, and almost came to blows over how to organize it. I started working really late. My girlfriend began to doubt I actually existed.</p>
<p>The worst part was all the stuff the newbies had done. Some of them would have the consent sheets numbered in the upper left-hand-corner instead of the upper-right-hand corner. Others would have written the patient name down on the Results Log instead of the Secret Code Log right next to it. One even wrote something in green pen on a formal study document. It was hopeless. Finally we just decided to throw away all their data and pretend it had never existed. </p>
<p>With that decision made, our work actually started to look pretty good. As bad as it was working for an obsessive-compulsive boss in an insane bureaucracy, at least it had the advantage that &#8211; when nitpicking push came to ridiculous shove &#8211; you were going to be super-ready to be audited. I hoped. Like an idiot.</p>
<p><b>December 2016</b></p>
<p>The auditor found twenty-seven infractions.</p>
<p>She was very apologetic about it. She said that was actually a pretty good number of infractions for a study this size, that we were actually doing pretty well compared to a lot of the studies she&#8217;d seen. She said she absolutely wasn&#8217;t going to shut us down, she wasn&#8217;t even going to censure us. She just wanted us to make twenty-seven changes to our study and get IRB approval for each of them.</p>
<p>I kept the audit report as a souvenier. I have it in front of me now. Here&#8217;s an example infraction:</p>
<blockquote><p>The data and safety monitoring plan consists of &#8216;the Principal Investigator will randomly check data integrity&#8217;. This is a prospective study with a vulnerable group (mental illness, likely to have diminished capacity, likely to be low income) and, as such, would warrant a more rigorous monitoring plan than what is stated above. In addition to the above, a more adequate plan for this study would also include review of the protocol at regular intervals, on-going checking of any participant complaints or difficulties with the study, monitoring that the approved data variables are the only ones being collected, regular study team meetings to discuss progress and any deviations or unexpected problems. Team meetings help to assure participant protections, adherence to the protocol. Having an adequate monitoring plan is a federal requirement for the approval of a study. See Regulation 45 CFR 46.111 Criteria For IRB Approval Of Research. IRB Policy: PI Qualifications And Responsibility In Conducting Research. Please revise the protocol via a protocol revision request form. Recommend that periodic meetings with the research team occur and be documented.</p></blockquote>
<p>Among my favorite other infractions:</p>
<p>1. The protocol said we would stop giving the screening exam to patients if they became violent, but failed to rigorously define &#8220;violent&#8221;.</p>
<p>2. We still weren&#8217;t educating our patients enough about &#8220;Alternatives To Participating In This Study&#8221;. The auditor agreed that the only alternative was &#8220;not participating in this study&#8221;, but said that we had to tell every patient that, then document that we&#8217;d done so.</p>
<p>3. The consent forms were still getting signed in pencil. We are never going to live this one down. If I live to be a hundred, representatives from the IRB are going to break into my deathbed room and shout &#8220;YOU LET PEOPLE SIGN CONSENT FORMS IN PENCIL, HOW CAN YOU JUSTIFY THAT?!&#8221;</p>
<p>4. The woman in the corner office who kept insisting everybody take the Pre-Study Training&#8230;hadn&#8217;t taken the Pre-Study Training, and was therefore unqualified to be our liaison with the IRB. I swear I am not making this up.</p>
<p>Faced with submitting twenty-seven new pieces of paperwork to correct our twenty-seven infractions, Dr. W and I gave up. We shredded the patient data and the Secret Code Log. We told all the newbies they could give up and go home. We submitted the Project Closure Form to the woman in the corner office (who as far as I know still hasn&#8217;t completed her Pre-Study Training). We told the IRB that they had won, fair and square; we surrendered unconditionally. </p>
<p>They didn&#8217;t seem the least bit surprised.</p>
<p><b>August 2017</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been sitting on this story for a year. I thought it was unwise to publish it while I worked for the hospital in question. I still think it&#8217;s a great hospital, that it delivers top-notch care, that it has amazing doctors, that it has a really good residency program, and even that the Research Department did everything it could to help me given the legal and regulatory constraints. I don&#8217;t want this to reflect badly on them in any way. I just thought it was wise to wait a year.</p>
<p>During that year, Dr. W and I worked together on two less ambitious studies, carefully designed not to require any contact with the IRB. One was a case report, the other used publicly available data.</p>
<p>They won 1st and 2nd prize at a regional research competition. I got some nice certificates for my wall and a little prize money. I went on to present one of them at the national meeting of the American Psychiatric Association, a friend helped me write it up formally, and it was recently accepted for publication by a medium-tier journal.</p>
<p>I say this not to boast, but to protest that I&#8217;m not as much of a loser as my story probably makes me sound. I&#8217;m capable of doing research, I think I have something to contribute to Science. I still think the bipolar screening test is inappropriate for inpatient diagnosis, and I still think that patients are being harmed by people&#8217;s reliance on it. I still think somebody should look into it and publish the results.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just saying it&#8217;s not going to be me. I am <i>done</i> with research. People keep asking me &#8220;You seem really into science, why don&#8217;t you become a researcher?&#8221; Well&#8230;</p>
<p>I feel like a study that realistically could have been done by one person in a couple of hours got dragged out into hundreds of hours of paperwork hell for an entire team of miserable doctors. I think its scientific integrity was screwed up by stupid requirements like the one about breaking blinding, and the patients involved were put through unnecessary trouble by being forced to sign endless consent forms screaming to them about nonexistent risks. </p>
<p>I feel like I was dragged almost to the point of needing to be in a psychiatric hospital myself, while my colleagues who just <i>used</i> the bipolar screening test &#8211; without making the mistake of trying to check if it works &#8211; continue to do so without anybody questioning them or giving them the slightest bit of aggravation.</p>
<p>I feel like some scientists do amazingly crappy studies that couldn&#8217;t possibly prove anything, but get away with it because they have a well-funded team of clerks and secretaries who handle the paperwork for them. And that I, who was trying to do everything right, got ground down with so many pointless security-theater-style regulations that I&#8217;m never going to be able to do the research I would need to show they&#8217;re wrong.</p>
<p>In the past year or so, I&#8217;ve been gratified to learn some other people are thinking along the same lines. Somebody linked me to <A HREF="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/censors-hand">The Censor&#8217;s Hand</A>, a book by a law/medicine professor at the University of Michigan. A summary from <A HREF="http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/should-irbs-be-dismantled/">a review</A>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Schneider opens by trying to tally the benefits of IRB review. “Surprisingly,” he writes, a careful review of the literature suggests that “research is not especially dangerous. Some biomedical research can be risky, but much of it requires no physical contact with patients and most contact cannot cause serious injury. Ill patients are, if anything, safer in than out of research.” As for social-science research, “its risks are trivial compared with daily risks like going online or on a date.”</p>
<p>Since the upsides of IRB review are likely to be modest, Schneider argues, it’s critical to ask hard questions about the system’s costs. And those costs are serious. To a lawyer’s eyes, IRBs are strangely unaccountable. They don’t have to offer reasons for their decisions, their decisions can’t be appealed, and they’re barely supervised at the federal level. That lack of accountability, combined with the gauzy ethical principles that govern IRB deliberations, is a recipe for capriciousness. Indeed, in Schneider’s estimation, IRBs wield coercive government power—the power to censor university research—without providing due process of law.</p>
<p>And they’re not shy about wielding that power. Over time, IRB review has grown more and more intrusive. Not only do IRBs waste thousands of researcher hours on paperwork and elaborate consent forms that most study participants will never understand. Of greater concern, they also superintend research methods to minimize perceived risks. Yet IRB members often aren’t experts in the fields they oversee. Indeed, some know little or nothing about research methods at all.</p>
<p>IRBs thus delay, distort, and stifle research, especially research on vulnerable subgroups that may benefit most from it. It’s hard to precise about those costs, but they’re high: after canvassing the research, Schneider concludes that “IRB regulation annually costs thousands of lives that could have been saved, unmeasurable suffering that could have been softened, and uncountable social ills that could have been ameliorated.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This view seems to be growing more popular lately, and has gotten support from high-profile academics like Richard Nisbett and Steven Pinker:</p>
<p><center></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Should IRBs (human subjects research approval committees) be dismantled? [Probably yes.] <a href="http://t.co/5mxhEycEA5">http://t.co/5mxhEycEA5</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Steven Pinker (@sapinker) <a href="https://twitter.com/sapinker/status/624603026997706752">July 24, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center></p>
<p>And there&#8217;s been some recent reform, maybe. The federal Office for Human Research Protections <A HREF="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/science/social-science-research-institutional-review-boards-common-rule.html">made a vague statement</A> that perhaps studies that obviously aren&#8217;t going to hurt anybody might not need the full IRB treatment. There&#8217;s still a lot of debate about how this will be enforced and whether it&#8217;s going to lead to any real-life changes. But I&#8217;m glad people are starting to think more about these things. </p>
<p>(I&#8217;m also glad people are starting to agree that getting rid of a little oversight for the lowest-risk studies is a good compromise, and that we don&#8217;t have to start with anything more radical.)</p>
<p>I sometimes worry that people misunderstand the case against bureaucracy. People imagine it&#8217;s Big Business complaining about the regulations preventing them from steamrolling over everyone else. That hasn&#8217;t been my experience. Big Business &#8211; heck, Big Anything &#8211; loves bureaucracy. They can hire a team of clerks and secretaries and middle managers to fill out all the necessary forms, and the rest of the company can be on their merry way. It&#8217;s everyone else who suffers. The amateurs, the entrepreneurs, the hobbyists, the people doing something as a labor of love. Wal-Mart is going to keep selling groceries no matter how much paperwork and inspections it takes; the poor immigrant family with the backyard vegetable garden might not.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy in science does the same thing: limit the field to big institutional actors with vested interests. No amount of hassle is going to prevent the Pfizer-Merck-Novartis Corporation from doing whatever study will raise their bottom line. But enough hassle <i>will</i> prevent a random psychiatrist at a small community hospital from pursuing his pet theory about bipolar diagnosis. The more hurdles we put up, the more the scientific conversation skews in favor of Pfizer-Merck-Novartis. And the less likely we are to hear little stuff, dissenting voices, and things that don&#8217;t make anybody any money.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not just talking about IRBs here. I could write a book about this. There are so many privacy and confidentiality restrictions around the most harmless of datasets that research teams won&#8217;t share data with one another (let alone with unaffiliated citizen scientists) lest they break some arcane regulation or other. Closed access journals require people to pay thousands of dollars in subscription fees before they&#8217;re allowed to read the scientific literature; open-access journals just shift the burden by requiring scientists to pay thousands of dollars to publish their research. Big research institutions have whole departments to deal with these kinds of problems; unaffiliated people who just want to look into things on their own are out of luck.</p>
<p>And this is happening at the same time we&#8217;re becoming increasingly aware of the shortcomings of big-name research. <A HREF="https://www.nature.com/news/over-half-of-psychology-studies-fail-reproducibility-test-1.18248">Half of psychology studies</A> fail replication; my own field of psychiatry <A HREF="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0158064">is even worse</A>. And citizen-scientists and science bloggers are playing a big part in debunking bad research: here I&#8217;m thinking especially of statistics bloggers like <A HREF="http://andrewgelman.com/">Andrew Gelman</A> and <A HREF="http://daniellakens.blogspot.com/">Daniel Lakens</A>, but there are all sorts of people in this category. And both Gelman and Lakens are PhDs with institutional affiliations  &#8211; &#8220;citizen science&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean random cavemen who don&#8217;t understand the field &#8211; but they&#8217;re both operating outside their day job, trying to contribute a few hours per project instead of a few years. I know many more people like them &#8211; smart, highly-qualified, but maybe not going to hire a team of paper-pushers and spend thousands of dollars in fees in order to say what they have to say. Even now these people are doing great work &#8211; but I can&#8217;t help but feel like more is possible.</p>
<p>IRB overreach is a small part of the problem. But it&#8217;s the part which sunk my bipolar study, a study I really cared about. I&#8217;m excited that there&#8217;s finally more of a national conversation about this kind of thing, and hopeful that further changes will make scientific efforts easier and more rewarding for the next generation of doctors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Related:</b> <A HREF="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/24/the-hospital-orientation/">0/4</A>, <A HREF="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/30/medicine-as-not-seen-on-tv/">1/4</A>, <A HREF="http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/29/reflections-from-the-halfway-point/">2/4</A>, <A HREF="http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/07/12/34/">3/4</A></p>
<p>Last Friday I said goodbye to my patients, handed over my pager, and left Our Lady Of An Undisclosed Location for the last time.</p>
<p>I was hoping for a moment for quiet reflection, but I made it about halfway to the door before being accosted by an incoming intern who couldn&#8217;t figure out how to use the medical record system. I helped her, because I&#8217;d definitely been there before. I was looking back over my blog archives from four years ago, when I started all of this, and I&#8217;d written:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you&#8217;re entering medical residency and want to prepare, practice this phrase: “I don’t know the answer to that question, but I&#8217;ll page my senior resident and he will get back to you.” I keep getting paged by nurses with questions like “Your patient in room 315 has critically low potassium, please advise.” And I went through medical school and I know stuff about low potassium and I have clever ideas for what to do and probably in over 80% of cases those ideas would not kill the patient. But “over 80%” isn&#8217;t enough, so each time I have to find my senior, who&#8217;s really busy and hates getting paged just like everyone else, and ask him a stupid question I already know the answer to.</p></blockquote>
<p>And even though it seemed kind of unlikely at the time, that thing which happens to the people in all of those medical shows like <i>Scrubs</i> happened to me. I survived intern year. I developed some vague foggy idea what I was doing. At some point I crossed the border into competence. I started becoming one of the people who answers the clueless questions instead of one of the people who asks them.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say enough nice things about my hospital. They put up with me through all those years I didn&#8217;t really know what I was doing, invested thousands of hours into training me. They answered all my rookie questions, like &#8220;why can&#8217;t patients wear shoes with laces?&#8221; (answer: because you can tie shoelaces into a noose to hang yourself with) or &#8220;why do we have to learn this style of therapy when studies show it&#8217;s no more effective than empathetic listening?&#8221; (answer: because the government says so). Everyone knows the stereotypes about residency &#8211; you&#8217;re overworked, you&#8217;re abused, you&#8217;re treated like pond scum &#8211; and my hospital put the lie to every single one.</p>
<p>And I can&#8217;t say enough nice things about the other residents in my program. I&#8217;ve never been good at making friends, but being thrown into the lion pit together is a pretty powerful form of bonding, and after the existential terror of intern year where some twenty-something-year-olds who have been to medical school but are otherwise pretty normal people get shoved into a hopital and expected to treat patients together, I think we became pretty close. I never had to trust them with my life, but I trusted my patients&#8217; lives to them every day. I&#8217;ve strategized first dates with them, been to their weddings, cooed over their newborn babies. Um. Had several-year-long arguments about consciousness with them. Met the gurus of their obscure religions. Good times.</p>
<p>But Kurt Vonnegut writes about the difference between two kinds of teams. A granfalloon is a team of people pushed together for some ordinary human purpose, like learning medicine or running a hospital psychiatry department. They may get to know each other well. They may like each other. But in the end, the purpose will be achieved, and they&#8217;ll go their separate ways.</p>
<p>A karass is a group of people brought together by God for some purpose of His own. No matter how little time they spend together, or how poorly organized they might be, they&#8217;ll always be on the same wavelength and have a special kinship with each other.</p>
<p>And all the wonderful and compassionate people I got to know during my four years in Michigan are my granfalloon. I&#8217;ve never stopped feeling like you guys &#8211; the rationalists, the effective altruists, the transhumanists, the AI scientists, the statisticians, and all the rest &#8211; are my karass. All these years I&#8217;ve had to spend away from you have felt a little bit like exile. </p>
<p>Back when I first left the Bay Area to take this position four years ago, I wrote myself a letter. I said that I know about value drift as well as anybody. People always say that they&#8217;re going to love their first girlfriend forever, and then it never happens. Or they say they&#8217;re going to keep in touch with their college friends, and then they forget. But &#8211; 2013-me wrote to 2017-me &#8211; if your values drift so far that you find yourself wanting to stay in Michigan, just&#8230;take a step back and think about it. Remember all the friends you have out west, and how exciting the intellectual climate is, and your feeling that it&#8217;s some kind of fulcrum for the forces that will produce the future, the sort of place that Athens must have felt like in 400 BC, or Florence in 1400. And before you end up marrying some Michigan girl and opening up a practice across the street from the hospital where you trained, just remember everything out here and how much you used to love it.</p>
<p>And even though I had a better time in Michigan than I could possibly have hoped &#8211; even though Detroit pizza is literally my favorite food ever and I&#8217;m kind of panicking at the idea of being somewhere you can&#8217;t get it delivered &#8211; despite all of that <i>I didn&#8217;t even have to open the letter</i>. I remember everything in it perfectly clearly. My values haven&#8217;t drifted at all. All of you are great.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m happy to be able to announce that I&#8217;ve just accepted a psychiatrist position in the San Francisco metropolitan area &#8211; the greatest metropolitan area in the world! I&#8217;ve cancelled my lease, loaded everything I own into the trusty little Subaru I got before I realized that driving a Subaru in Detroit would earn you constant dirty looks, and am very gradually moving west.</p>
<p>Thanks to all of you for keeping in touch and helping me stay sane these past four years. I&#8217;ll be seeing you very soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s nine o&#8217;clock on a Wednesday<br />
The regular crowd shuffles in<br />
There&#8217;s an old man lying next to me<br />
Spewing vomit all over his chin</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;Doc, can you give me a medicine?<br />
The name ought to be on my chart<br />
But it&#8217;s safe and it&#8217;s strong<br />
And it helped me along<br />
When I had a younger man&#8217;s heart&#8221;</p>
<p><A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmVmt_v32qU">♪ ♬ La la la, de de da, la la la de da, da dum ♪ ♬</A></p>
<p>Give us some drugs, you&#8217;re the evening doc<br />
Give us some drugs tonight<br />
Well we&#8217;re all in the mood for some opiates<br />
And they&#8217;ll get us feeling alright</p>
<p>Now John in bed five is a friend of mine<br />
He gets bouts of COPD<br />
And he&#8217;s quick with a joke or to light up a smoke<br />
Which I guess is what brings him to me</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;Doc, I believe this is killing me&#8221;<br />
I agree he is probably right<br />
And he tells me that&#8217;s it, and he swears that he&#8217;ll quit<br />
And he asks me to pass him a light</p>
<p>♪ ♬ La la la, de de da, la la la de da, da dum ♪ ♬</p>
<p>Now Paul is a boy with leukaemia<br />
Who never had time for a wife<br />
And he&#8217;s talking with Meg, who takes food through a PEG<br />
And will probably have to for life</p>
<p>And the man in bed ten yells obscenities<br />
As the lady in six gives a moan<br />
She&#8217;s paying eight thousand for hospice care<br />
But it&#8217;s better than dying alone</p>
<p>Give us some drugs, you&#8217;re the evening doc<br />
Give us some drugs tonight<br />
Well we&#8217;re all in the mood for some opiates<br />
And they&#8217;ll get us feeling alright</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a pretty good crowd for a Wednesday<br />
And the pharmacist gives me a vial<br />
&#8216;Cause he knows that it&#8217;s that, they&#8217;ve been coming to get<br />
To forget about pain for a while</p>
<p>And the corridor smells like c. difficile<br />
And the bed alarm sounds like a jeer<br />
And I take some caffeine and I stare at my screen<br />
And think <i>God, what am I doing here?</i></p>
<p>Give us some drugs, you&#8217;re the evening doc<br />
Give us some drugs tonight<br />
Well we&#8217;re all in the mood for some opiates<br />
And they&#8217;ll get us feeling alright</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AskReddit asked recently: If you could only give an alien one thing to help them understand the human race, what would you give them?</p>
<p>At the time I had no good answer. Now I do. I would give them <A HREF="http://charlottelennox.livejournal.com/887.html">Charlotte Lennox&#8217;s write-up of how MsScribe took over Harry Potter fandom</A> (warning: super-long but super-worth-it).</p>
<p>Ozy informs me that everyone else in the world read this story five years ago. Maybe I am hopelessly behind the times? Maybe all my blog readers are intimately familiar with it? </p>
<p>If not, read it. Read it like an anthropological text. Read it like you would a study of the Yanomamo. No, read it even better than that. Read it like you would a study of the Yanomamo if you knew that, statistically, some of your friends and co-workers covertly become Yanomamo after getting home every evening.</p>
<p>I hesitate to summarize it, because people will read my summary and ignore the much superior original. I would not recommend that. But if you insist on skipping the (admittedly super-long) link above, here is what happens:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the early 2000s, Harry Potter fanfiction authors and readers get embroiled in an apocalyptic feud between people who think that Harry should be in a relationship with Ginny vs. people who think Harry should be in a relationship with Hermione. This devolves from debate to personal attacks to real world stalking and harassment to legal cases to them splitting the community into different sites that pretty much refuse to talk to each other and ban stories with their nonpreferred relationship.</p>
<p>These sites then sort themselves out into a status hierarchy with a few people called Big Name Fans at the top and everyone else competing to get their attention and affection, whether by praising them slavishly or by striking out in particularly cruel ways at people in the &#8220;enemy&#8221; relationship community.</p>
<p>A young woman named MsScribe joins the Harry/Hermione community. She proceeds to make herself popular and famous by use of sock-puppet accounts (a sockpuppet is when someone uses multiple internet nicknames to pretend to be multiple different people) that all praise her and talk about how great she is. Then she moves on to racist and sexist sockpuppet accounts who launch lots of slurs at her, so that everyone feels very sorry for her.</p>
<p>At the height of her power, she controls a small army of religious trolls who go around talking about the sinfulness of Harry Potter fanfiction authors and <i>especially</i> MsScribe and how much they hate gay people. All of these trolls drop hints about how they are supported by the Harry/Ginny community, and MsScribe leads the campaign to paint everyone who wants Harry and Ginny to be in a relationship as vile bigots and/or Christians. She classily cements her position by convincing everyone to call them &#8220;cockroaches&#8221; and post pictures of cockroaches whenever they make comments.</p>
<p>Throughout all this, a bunch of people are coming up with ironclad evidence that she is the one behind all of this (this is the Internet! They can just trace IPs!) Throughout all of it, MsScribe makes increasingly implausible denials. And throughout all of it, everyone supports MsScribe and ridicules her accusers. Because really, do you want to be on the side of a confirmed popular person, or a bunch of confirmed suspected racists whom we know are racist because they deny racism <i>which is exactly what we would expect racists to do?</i></p>
<p>MsScribe writes negatively about a fan with cancer asking for money, and her comments get interpreted as being needlessly cruel to a cancer patient. Her popularity drops and everyone takes a second look at the evidence and realizes hey, she was obviously manipulating everyone all along. There is slight sheepishness but few apologies, because hey, we honestly thought the people we were bullying were unpopular.</p></blockquote>
<p>MsScribe later ended up switching from Harry Potter fandom to blogging about social justice issues, which does not surprise me one bit. But let me do some social justice blogging of my own.</p>
<p>A lot of the comments I have seen discussing the issue say &#8220;Yeah, teenage girls will be teenage girls&#8221;. </p>
<p>Two responses seem relevant. First, quite a few of the people involved seem to have been in their late twenties or early thirties.</p>
<p>But second and more important, I am a guy and this story speaks to me because it is <i>eerily</i> similar to the story of my online life with a bunch of other guys when I was between about ages fifteen and twenty-two.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned before how <A HREF="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/15/things-i-learned-by-spending-five-thousand-years-in-an-alternate-universe/">I spent long portions of my life</A> in the interactive geofiction/&#8221;micronation&#8221; community. And because of the innate urge for self-presentation, I emphasized the part where we create amazing grand-scale fictional universes in which we enact epic battles and build civilizations from the ground up. And not the part where we behave like ridiculous little children having a hissy fit.</p>
<p>The first constructed country I was ever in, another guy named John from my school comes in and says that I am a bad leader and abusing my power. Because my online handle at the time was Giant_Squid314, he classily nicknames me &#8220;Squitler&#8221; and leads a bunch of his supporters to make &#8220;Squitler&#8221; related comments at everything I do. Then he and his friends secede to start their own country, named after a Red Hot Chili Peppers album. I retaliate by convincing his friends that he is oppressing them and they need to start a communist revolution to kick him out of the country, which works. Later he gets back in and convinces his friends to join my country under fake names, swelling the ranks of voters with people who are there just to vote for the worst policies in order to destroy the country. This becomes so bad that my friend Evan pulls a bloodless coup to abolish democracy and make himself sole leader, but then he cracks down so hard on John&#8217;s supporters that everyone gets upset and leaves (&#8220;emigrates&#8221;). This upsets my friend Bill, who somehow hacks John and tries to delete all his stuff; John counterhacks Bill and destroys his country. Then we all team up with a bunch of guys from Ireland, infiltrate John&#8217;s country and destroy it the same way he destroyed us as an act of revenge.</p>
<p>All this happened within about three months real-time, and I was in this hobby for ten years. <i>Ten years</i>.</p>
<p>There was an entire era when people would accuse other people of having said racist things on IRC (where logs were often unavailable, and context was absent). This would then be followed with the demand that every political ally of the affected person shun him forever and kick him out of the country and destroy every institution he had built, or else <i>obviously</i> they were secretly racist themselves. This was met with the only possible response: &#8220;actually, no, <i>you&#8217;re</i> the one who said racist things on the chat!&#8221;. These accusations often resembled the MsScribe story in their sheer not-entirely-social-justice-movement-approved incongruity: &#8220;You&#8217;re racist, and you&#8217;re a fat lardass!&#8221; &#8220;Oh yeah? Well you&#8217;re a f**king homophobic autistic Aspie who will never get laid!&#8221;  Inevitably the more popular person would win and anyone so foolish as to defend the unpopular person (which I <i>kept doing</i>, because I never learn) was banished to Racist Hell. As for Actual Hell, there was a guy named Archbishop Fenton who kept saying really extreme Christian stuff about how we were all going there, and although we all suspected he was a sockpuppet I was never able to figure out whose.</p>
<p>So MsScribe? I&#8217;ll give her this: she was a gifted amateur. That is it. An amateur. We had frickin&#8217; decade-old &#8220;intelligence organizations&#8221; whose entire job was to collect a network of spies &#8211; some real people, some sock puppets &#8211; who would join other people&#8217;s countries under fake (or real!) identities, get information on their secret plans, and throw important elections in favor of the parties we supported. I&#8217;m not even ashamed of my role leading one of the largest of these organizations, Shireroth&#8217;s spy bureau S.H.I.N.E. &#8211; if we had unilaterally disengaged from these kinds of games, we would have been demolished by people who didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I remember our scandals. We would build up &#8220;dossiers&#8221; on various individuals, then publicize them at times calculated to cause maximum damage. One of my favorite was when a prominent female politician was revealed to in fact be male &#8211; causing her support to plummet among the key &#8220;people who do whatever a girl says in the hopes that she will like them&#8221; demographic. In another, which happened a bit after my semi-retirement, the micronational world&#8217;s largest communist country, with thirty highly active citizens and a prominent international role, was found to be just one guy posting under thirty different names.</p>
<p>As leader of an espionage organization, I was expected to be able to avoid these damaging revelations, advise my countrymen on how to do the same, and run circles around my enemies. Without tooting my own horn too much, I maintained my most successful character for the better part of a year. This was a guy named Yvain, who infiltrated a Celtic-themed fantasy state called the Duchy of Goldenmoon, took it over, took over its largest neighbor, and was halfway to ultimate power over the entire continent before I got accepted to medical school and decided I should probably reassess how I was using my time.</p>
<p>(to create a paper trail and avoid breaking character, I used the nick &#8220;Yvain&#8221; for a lot of the websites I joined around this period, which is why half the Internet <i>still</i> knows me by that name. I am suitably embarassed by this)</p>
<p>Now I will say this for us boys &#8211; and we were boys, like 95% of us, and even the girls were usually found to be boys after careful investigation. We did it with class, we did it with cool names like &#8220;Paramountgate&#8221; and &#8220;The Three Hours&#8217; War&#8221;, we wrote up our petty scandals into epic history books with bibliographies and appendices, and we backstabbed each other so elegantly it would make Machiavelli shed a single tear of pure joy. But in the end? We behaved <i>exactly</i> like teenage girls in a Harry Potter fandom.</p>
<p>It is hard at this point not to be reminded of the <A HREF="http://lesswrong.com/lw/lt/the_robbers_cave_experiment/">Robbers&#8217; Cave experiment</A>. Social psychologists divided boys at a camp into two groups, intending to do some experiments in order to figure out what they needed to do to make the groups hate each other, only to learn that the boys had <i>already</i> started hating each other with the burning fire of a thousand suns while they were busy planning the experiments. They boys had even formed little group identities, like &#8220;Our group are the rough and street-smart ones, the other group is a bunch of holier-than-thou goody-goodies&#8221; (the groups were chosen at random). </p>
<p>I read a lot of psychology even as a teenager, so it never surprised me that separating people out into different fictional countries would have the same effect.</p>
<p>But it did kind of surprise me that you could get <i>quite</i> those depths of hatred between people who thought that a fictional wizard should hook up with his best friend, versus other people who who thought he should hook up with his other best friend&#8217;s little sister.  Every time I feel like my opinion of people is sufficiently low, I get new evidence making me bump it lower. </p>
<p>Anyway, once those depths of hatred are established, they will proceed in the same way among twenty-somethings trying to discuss Harry Potter romantic pairings, teenagers trying to run fictional countries, and Senators trying to pass vitally important legislation. And that&#8217;s why, if aliens ever requested exactly one item to teach them about the human race, I would give them the MsScribe story.</p>
<p>They&#8217;d kill us all, of course. They would sterilize Earth so thoroughly that not even the archaeobacteria would remain. But in the moment before I was vaporized, I would feel like our species had finally been <i>understood</i>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>[TRIGGER WARNING: This would be a really bad post to read if you have or are about to have a young child]</i></p>
<p><b>I.</b></p>
<p>One of the downsides to working in psychiatry is that it is slowly but inexorably sapping away first my enthusiasm about, and now even my willingness to, have children.</p>
<p>Medicine was bad enough. It wasn&#8217;t the kids who get leukaemia at age seven and die who got to me. It was the ones with syndromes. Down Syndrome is the one everyone knows about, but by no means the worst. Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome is a lovely little condition in which children are born without the ability to metabolize uric acid properly. The results include severe mental retardation, stereotyped jerking movements of the limbs, face frozen in a permanent grimace, and something the textbooks charmingly refer to as &#8220;involuntary writhing&#8221;. For poorly understood reasons, these children also exhibit &#8220;uncontrollable self-injury&#8221;, usually head-banging and trying to bite any part of their body within reach of their mouth &#8211; something caregivers quickly learn not to let parts of their bodies be. Oh, and also vomiting, spitting, and uncontrollable urges to use profanity.</p>
<p>(for a fun intellectual exercise, imagine what arguments might be able to convince William of Ockham that &#8220;deficiency in uric acid metabolism&#8221; is a more parsimonious explanation for this syndrome than &#8220;possessed by demons&#8221;)</p>
<p>The disability rights crowd will probably call me ableist, or disableophobic, or misodisablistic, or whatever people say these days, but the idea of having a child with Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome, and having to take care of him until he dies (likely in his teens; it&#8217;s not a very survivable disease) or gets old enough to go off to a group home &#8211; that terrifies me. I worry I would spend every second of every day hating my kid and begrudging him the countless hours and tens of thousands of dollars I would be spending on him, all while maintaining a smile both to him &#8211; because goodness knows he has it bad enough already without having to cope with crushing guilt and parental enmity &#8211; and to the rest of the world &#8211; so I could get my official status as Brave and Kind Long-Suffering Caretaker, instead of Ableist Jerk Who Kind Of Wishes He Could Just Put His Kid Out Of His Misery And Get On With His Life).</p>
<p>(note: I use the masculine pronoun not unreflectively, but because Lesch-Nyhan is x-linked recessive)</p>
<p>The good news is the incidence of Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome is only 1/400,000 births. The bad news is that if it&#8217;s not Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome, it could be Treacher-Collins Syndrome. Or DiGeorge Syndrome. Or Cornelia de Lange Syndrome. Or any of a thousand others. Have you ever seen a Pediatric Genetics text? They&#8217;re not small books.</p>
<p>And not all of these are Lesch-Nyhan-level bad &#8211; I like playing with Down Syndrome kids. But I would still be unexpectedly finding out that what I thought was just a perfectly normal super-gargantuan committment to sink <i>most</i> of my resources into a mostly-helpless creature for twenty-five years would in fact become, without my planning or consent, a super-ultra-titano-gargantuan commitment to sink <i>even more</i> of my resources into an even-more-helpless creature indefinitely. And all the associated dreams &#8211; of seeing my kid get grow up and raise a family, of debating the great questions of life with zir, of secretly training zir to be a child prodigy who does calculus at age five like John Stuart Mill &#8211; would all be gone. I am reluctant to say &#8220;all the things I look forward to about having a kid&#8221;, because someone will lecture me about how I <i>should</i> want to just gaze deep into my child&#8217;s eyes, loving them unconditionally as a human being in the image of God. But as the saying goes, we can do what we want but cannot want what we want. Also, eye contact is scary.</p>
<p>But at this point it&#8217;s not even the syndromes that worry me the most. The kids with syndromes I&#8217;ve met are nice people, I like them, and if it came to that I&#8217;d at least have great social support from my amazing friends.</p>
<p>Right now what scares me is psychiatry.</p>
<p><b>II.</b></p>
<p>I remember vividly the first time I met my first antisocial personality disorder patient with perfect parents.</p>
<p>The dad was a something something manager at Ford. The mom was a high school teacher. Both from middle class backgrounds, never been in a fight, never been in jail, never even used drugs. Two other children at home, one of them working on college applications to nice schools, the other getting As in junior high and playing in the band.</p>
<p>Their oldest kid was in the psychiatric hospital where I worked because&#8230;actually, no, I can&#8217;t remember what he was in for, the particular time when I met his parents. It could have been the stabbing people. It could have been the constant drug use. It could have been lying like a rug to the police. And as I was explaining whichever the latest disaster was to his parents, on their faces was just this look of heartbreak mixed with total lack of surprise.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d seen dozens of patients worse than this guy already, but they&#8217;d all been easy to brush off as something that could never happen to me. Either their parents were just as bad as they are, or they&#8217;d been beaten as a kid, or they had a history of sexual abuse, or something else where it was very easy to say &#8220;Aha! I will just not attack my children with broken beer bottles when I am a father, and then they won&#8217;t turn out this way.&#8221; Or since technically I&#8217;m supposed to be kind of a genetic determinist, I could just not have terrible person genes, and marry someone else without terrible person genes, and our kid would be okay too. </p>
<p>This guy&#8217;s family &#8211; and he was the first of several &#8211; didn&#8217;t give me any of those easy outs. You can do everything right in the world, and your kid can still grow up to be a murderer, or a rapist, or just one of those guys with a tattoo of a skull and a nickname like &#8220;Snake&#8221;.</p>
<p>I like the metaphor of &#8220;the genetic lottery&#8221;, but on the worst days it starts to feel more like genetic Russian Roulette. Maybe the first kid is beautiful and grows up to be a scientist, the second one is compassionate and becomes an artist, and then boom, the third one vivisects stray cats and tries to burn the house down. But it&#8217;s too late to return her for store credit; you&#8217;re morally obligated to spend twenty years taking care of her and sending her to special schools and taking late night calls from the police and paying her bail, all in the desperate hope that maybe one day she&#8217;ll shape up. Like I said. Russian roulette.</p>
<p><b>III.</b></p>
<p>I get irrationally angry whenever I hear people diss discipline. Like, if you just believe spanking is often bad for children, then that&#8217;s fine and as far as I can tell empirically correct. What bothers me is the people who see someone spank their kid and say &#8220;What that parent really needs to learn to do is talk things out. If they would just learn to communicate with their kid, the kid would learn that what ze&#8217;s doing is wrong, apologize, and none of this violence would be necessary.&#8221; This is the sort of statement that makes perfect sense if you&#8217;ve never been in a position where you had to control a genuinely bad (or even mediocre) kid.</p>
<p>(as such I am suspicious of its signaling value. That is, I worry that saying children should never be disciplined harshly is a way of saying &#8220;Ha ha, my children are so great I never need to discipline them. And there <i>you</i> are with a bad apple. Chump!&#8221;)</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, there are lots of problems with parents abusing kids under the excuse of &#8220;discipline&#8221;, and the idea of an unelected and unaccountable individual being able to hurt someone else whenever they want is terrifying. It might be that a Congressional bill to ban all discipline stronger than dirty looks would on net be a good thing. But when people try to push it by saying &#8220;If you just demonstrated your love and affection, you wouldn&#8217;t <i>need</i> any discipline&#8221; &#8211; that&#8217;s what gets my blood boiling.</p>
<p>I think this dates from my time as a schoolteacher. When I was a student, I hated all my teachers and thought that if they just ditched the constant repetition, the cutesy but vapid games, the police state attitude, then everyone would learn a lot more and school would finally live up to its potential as &#8220;not totally incompatible with learning, sometimes&#8221;.</p>
<p>And then I started teaching English, tried presenting the actually interesting things about the English language at a reasonable pace as if I were talking to real human beings. And <i>it was a disaster</i>. I would give this really brilliant and lucid presentation of a fascinating concept, and then ask a basic question about it, and even though I had <i>just</i> explained it, no one in the class would even have been listening to it. They&#8217;d be too busy chattering to one another in the corner. So finally out of desperation I was like &#8220;Who wants to do some kind of idiotic activity in which we all pick English words and color them in and then do a stupid dance about them??!&#8221; (I may not have used those exact words) and sure enough everyone wanted to and at the end some of them sort of vaguely remembered the vocabulary.</p>
<p>By the end of the school year I had realized that nothing was getting learned without threatening a test on it later, nothing was getting learned regardless unless it was rote memorization of a few especially boring points, and that I could usually force students to sit still long enough to learn it if and only if I bribed them with vapid games at regular intervals.</p>
<p>Yet pretty much every day I see people saying &#8220;Schools are evil fascist institutions that deliberately avoid teaching students for sinister reasons. If you just inspire a love of learning in them, they&#8217;ll be thrilled to finally have new vistas to explore and they&#8217;ll go above and beyond what you possibly expected.&#8221;</p>
<p>To which the only answer is <i>no they frickin&#8217; won&#8217;t</i>. Yes, there will be two or three who do. Probably <A HREF="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Typical_mind_fallacy">you were one of them</A>, or your kid is one of them, and you think everything should be centered around those people. Fine. That&#8217;s what home schooling is for. But there will also be oh so many who ask &#8220;Will the grandeur and beauty of the fathomless universe be on the test?&#8221;. And when you say that the <i>true</i> test is whether they feel connected to the tradition of inquiry into the mysteries of Nature, they&#8217;ll roll their eyes and secretly play Pokemon on their Nintendo DS thinking you can&#8217;t see it if it&#8217;s held kind of under their desk.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I used to be an optimist. I think I used to be a narcissist. I figured that when <i>I</i> was a teacher, everything would work out, my kids would be kind and attentive, my lessons would stick, and there would be no behavioral problems or if there are they would quiet down after I give them a friendly talk about why attention is important. I felt like the Universe <i>owed it</i> to me to have everything work out. I didn&#8217;t realize on a gut level that kids could just <i>not cooperate</i>.</p>
<p>The parents who pooh-pooh strict discipline have the same blind spot. It&#8217;s an easy blind spot to have if your own kids are wonderful. It&#8217;s hard to realize that you can just ask them to behave until you&#8217;re blue in the face, set strict limits, send them to bed without dessert, and the kid can just choose to <i>not behave</i>.</p>
<p>And we&#8217;ve come a long way from Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome here, but these all tie together into a complicated knot of worry. It&#8217;s a fundamental realization that <i>I could have a kid I can&#8217;t fix</i>. Not in the &#8220;I want her to be a businessperson but she wants to be a poet&#8221; sort of way, but in the &#8220;I want her to not vivisect cats for fun, and she wants to vivisect cats for fun&#8221; sort of way. Someone whom I lavish all the love in the world on, and give <A HREF="http://squid314.livejournal.com/346391.html">exactly the right dose of prenatal iodine</A>, and whatever, and the universe just says &#8220;Nope, you&#8217;re stuck with this person. You should have thought of that <i>before</i> one of your sperm had a single nucleotide mutation in an out-of-the-way corner of the genome&#8221;.</p>
<p>I have a serious girlfriend, and I&#8217;m only two years younger than my father was when he had me, and all my friends are having kids, and I really want children, and I have <i>no idea</i> what I&#8217;m going to do.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>I.</b></p>
<p>Suppose I were to come out tomorrow as gay.</p>
<p>I have amazing and wonderful friends, and I certainly wouldn&#8217;t expect them to hate me forever or tell me to burn in Hell or anything like that.</p>
<p>But even more than that, I think they would understand and accept the decision. There would be a lot of not-so-obvious failure modes they <i>could</i> fall into, but wouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>For example, I don&#8217;t think any of them would say something like &#8220;Oh, obviously you just haven&#8217;t met the right woman. I know this really cute girl Alanna, a friend of my sister&#8217;s. I&#8217;ll introduce you next time she&#8217;s around.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or &#8220;You must have just had a bad experience with women growing up. Maybe you always got into fights with your mother as a child. But there&#8217;s no reason to let that control you now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or &#8220;But&#8230;but&#8230;women are <i>attractive</i>! How could you not be <i>attracted</i> to people who are <i>attractive</i>? That&#8217;s just <i>silly</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>Or &#8220;You know, I&#8217;ve hung out with you a long time. You&#8217;re not into drama, you don&#8217;t wear flamboyant clothing, and you don&#8217;t speak with a lisp. You really have all the signs of someone who should be heterosexual. Maybe you&#8217;re just wrong about this whole &#8216;gay&#8217; thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>Or &#8220;Don&#8217;t you realize how important heterosexuality is? Heterosexuality is responsible for childbirth, for most of the love poems throughout history, and for the nuclear family. How can you not recognize that being straight is better than being gay?&#8221;</p>
<p>No, there are a lot of things my friends are far too sophisticated to ever even think about saying if I were to announce something as prosaic and socially acceptable as being gay.</p>
<p>But announce that I <i>don&#8217;t like math</i>, and suddenly the knives come out.</p>
<p><b>II.</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t recognize that math is awesome. If there were &#8220;Pray the lack-of-interest-in-math away&#8221; camps, I would totally go to one. But just as a gay guy may recognize the many ways his life would be easier if he were heterosexual but this recognition does not immediately lead to finding women attractive &#8211; so discoursing on the beauty and importance of math does not suddenly make math books any more readable to me.</p>
<p>Certainly I love the sort of math that doesn&#8217;t involve doing actual mathematics. I love reading about Moebius strips and Klein bottles, discussing the implications of Cantor&#8217;s discoveries about infinity, even playing around with fractals and tessellations and other forms of mathematical art. It&#8217;s just that when you put actual equations in front of me, with numbers and symbols and variables, my brain melts.</p>
<p>I mean, I&#8217;m not <i>terrible</i> at math. I managed to scrape together an A in Calculus II, the last math class I was required to take and not coincidentally the last math class I ever took. I did it by memorizing the algorithms involved and plugging things into them, all the while desperately praying that there weren&#8217;t any deviations, however minor, on the test. This isn&#8217;t normal for me. In every other field, concepts slide naturally into my mind and I can manipulate them however they want, like fitting a bunch of Lego blocks together to make limitless possibilities.</p>
<p>But math is like constructing a Lego set on a picnic table outside in the middle of a thunderstorm. I grope blindly in the pouring rain for the first piece, and finally put it in place, but by the time I&#8217;ve found the second piece and move to connect it to the first piece, the first piece has blown away and is nowhere to be found, and the instructions are sopping wet, and the picnic table has just been carried away by a tornado.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s that I&#8217;m bad at math, or that I just don&#8217;t enjoy math enough to be intrinsically motivated to pursue it. I do know that I have never become good at something &#8211; <i>good</i> good, not &#8220;scrape together an A in a mid-level college class on it good&#8221; &#8211; without having intrinsic motivation to pursue it. And my attempts to hack intrinsic motivation, which would be like a instant win condition for everything if I could achieve it, have been mostly unsuccessful and left me with <A HREF="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/19/can-you-condition-yourself/">severe doubt it is even possible</A>. So I have pretty much given up on math.</p>
<p>When I try to explain this to people, the responses are eerily similar to the ones they would never give if I said I was gay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, obviously you just haven&#8217;t learned the right kind of math. I know this really cute proof of the Pythagorean Theorem in my sister&#8217;s textbook. I&#8217;ll show it to you the next time we have pencil and paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or &#8220;You must have just had a bad experience with mathematics growing up. Maybe you always got yelled at by your math teacher as a child. But there&#8217;s no reason to let that control you now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or &#8220;But&#8230;but&#8230;math is <i>interesting</i>! How could you not be <i>interested</i> in a subject that&#8217;s <i>interesting</i>? That&#8217;s just <i>silly</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>Or &#8220;You know, I&#8217;ve hung out with you a long time. You like rationality, you&#8217;re good at science, and you like analyzing things. You really have all the signs of someone who should be into math. Maybe you&#8217;re just wrong about this whole &#8216;not a math person&#8217; thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>Or &#8220;Don&#8217;t you realize how important math is? Math is essential for statistics, for engineering, for science, for cognition itself! It&#8217;s closely linked to art and music and poetry! How can you not recognize that being into math is better than not being into math?&#8221;</p>
<p>And yes! I recognize it! Being bad at math is one of my biggest regrets in life! If I were building myself as an RPG character, things would look a lot different, believe you me. </p>

<p><i>My contribution to the &#8220;<A HREF="http://www.quickmeme.com/Scumbag-God/?upcoming">Scumbag God</A>&#8221; meme</i></center></p>
<p>But I&#8217;m pretty sure this <i>is</i> a skill point kind of thing. I think it&#8217;s totally possible for people, even smart people, not to be into math. And I am constantly surprised that people who claim to be experts in evolutionary psychology seem to think it&#8217;s entirely plausible that natural selection would evolve gay people with zero interest in procreative sex, but find it <i>totally outlandish</i> that anyone could end up without a math drive.</p>
<p>And if they don&#8217;t have the skill points, telling someone to just try a little harder at math is like telling Tyrion Lannister to just try a little harder at basketball. Not only is he never going to beat LeBron James, but he&#8217;s going to get upset and frustrated trying, and it&#8217;s not his comparative advantage anyway.</p>
<p><b>III.</b></p>
<p>This whole &#8220;comparative advantage&#8221; thing took me kind of by surprise.</p>
<p>Some people have trouble believing in &#8216;g&#8217;, the idea that all intelligence is correlated. I&#8217;ve always had trouble believing in anything else. I would see people around me being able to solve complicated math problems effortlessly, and think &#8220;They are smarter than me. I am their strict intellectual inferior. There is nothing I could possibly contribute to their conversations.&#8221;</p>
<p>And when these people started going out of their way to include me in their conversations, when they started making friends with me and even admiring me, I was pretty confused. For a while I was suspicious. Maybe I just had a few talents that were impressive <i>for someone who was bad at math</i>, like a chimp that has no verbal thought but can still remember where it hid the banana days later?</p>
<p>The idea that intelligence wasn&#8217;t monolithic, that I could be much worse than them in proofs and theorems but still be their equal in other areas, was hugely liberating to me, but it took me a very long time to accept it, to believe that I really was as valuable a human being as they were.</p>
<p>And when I tried to analyzed my certainty that &#8211; even despite the whole multiple intelligences thing &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t possibly be as good as them, it boiled down to something like this: they were talented at hard things, but I was only talented at <i>easy</i> things.</p>
<p>It took me about ten years to figure out the flaw in this argument, by the way.</p>
<p><b>IV.</b></p>
<p>I remember gossiping about a friend who was really into the worst types of politics &#8211; the kind where you&#8217;re <i>obsessed</i> about whether the head of the Republican National Committee will cut funding to a representative who said something mildly contrary to what someone else wanted him to say &#8211; and somewhere in the middle of the conversation my tone switched from &#8220;Yeah, what a loser to be concerned about that kind of thing&#8221; to &#8220;Yeah, poor guy, apparently he drew the short straw in the Things To Be Fascinated About Lottery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since then I have returned to the idea of this Things To Be Fascinated About Lottery a lot. There are some good draws you can get &#8211; people who are honestly fascinated with business and intrinsically motivated to pursue it only need high IQ and a few other subsidiary skills to get super rich. People who draw math can pursue <A HREF="http://xkcd.com/263/">perfect pure and philosophical truth</A> or excel at pretty much any science they choose and advance human knowledge. People who draw science without math have a harder time &#8211; I think I&#8217;m one of those &#8211; but there are still places for them.</p>
<p>And then there are other people who get other straws. There are some people who are really into politics, and find science really boring. There others who couldn&#8217;t care less about politics <i>or</i> science, as long as their sportsball team wins the Sports Bowl. Ozy picked a straw and ended up fascinated with gender, which wouldn&#8217;t be so bad except that it means ze occasionally has to talk to the <i>other</i> people who are fascinated with gender.</p>
<p>But the thing is, I couldn&#8217;t <i>choose</i> to be interested in sports any more than I could choose to be interested in math or a huge sports fan could choose to be interested in psychology or a gay person could choose to be interested in women. I mean, there&#8217;s probably some wiggle room, maybe if I put a lot of effort into finding the most interesting sports and learning everything about them I could appreciate them a little. But would I have comparative advantage over the kid who memorized the stats of every pitcher in both leagues when he was 8? Barring getting hit by some kinda cosmic rays or something, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;ll <i>ever</i>> happen.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d hate to turn this into a &#8220;rank which straws are best&#8221; contest, but some certainly earn you more money, some certainly help you contribute to the future of humankind more, and some certainly land you in healthy areas of study with nice people and mostly rational thought while others land you in diseased fields full of angry partisans. I wish I had landed in math. </p>
<p>But I no longer blame myself for not having done so. And when anyone starts telling me about how I&#8217;d love math if I only did it <i>their</i> way, I now only have a <i>little</i> twinge of guilt in telling them to go away.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I said a few days ago that I would be a terrible businessman because my attempts to promote things tend to meander into attempts to steelman the case against them. So I will spare MetaMed the ordeal of having me try to advertise for them.</p>
<p>But: they are a company, they have a website at <a href="http://www.metamed.com/">http://www.metamed.com</a>, they do personalized medical research, and they are officially launching today.</p>
<p>(they&#8217;ve been doing things for a bunch of people already, so it&#8217;s not like they&#8217;re completely new, but so far it&#8217;s been mostly unofficial)</p>
<p>I am usually a couple of steps away from customers, so I can&#8217;t speak much about that end of things. But I have been getting to do some research and occasionally just listen in on meetings, and it has been <i>so much fun</i> to listen to people who have this ethos that difficult medical questions should be solveable, who don&#8217;t make stupid mistakes or take shortcuts trying to solve them, and who have enough time and money to give them the attention they deserve.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago we had our first journal club. It was an attempt to evaluate the efficacy of antioxidants and multivitamins against cardiovascular disease and cancer. We got a bunch of contradictory studies, threw them all together, and started generating hypotheses about why they might contradict each other so much. It kind of fizzled out before we came to any strong conclusions, but in a world where <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/02/17/90-of-all-claims-about-the-problems-with-medical-studies-are-wrong/">some hard-to-determine number which is not ninety</a> percent of medical studies are wrong, it&#8217;s exactly the sort of thing that should be done (also, in the course of the discussion, &#8220;buy antioxidant supplements&#8221; went on and off my to do list several times; it&#8217;s currently off but I have no idea how long that will last).</p>
<p>Now there&#8217;s a discussion going on about the biochemicals in ginseng which I have yet to finish doing enough research on to participate in intelligently. But I&#8217;ve skimmed through what&#8217;s been said and what&#8217;s most fascinating to me is that no one has fallen into the standard error modes of &#8220;This is labelled as &#8216;alternative medicine&#8217;, therefore we know it sucks without investigating it&#8221; <i>or</i> &#8220;This is labelled as &#8216;alternative medicine&#8217;, therefore we know it&#8217;s great without thinking about it&#8221;, a seemingly basic feat of rationality which people nevertheless manage to miss 99% of the time.</p>
<p>There are already a couple of sites that aggregate medical information and try to pull a few tentative conclusions out of the maze of studies. <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/home">UpToDate</a> is a good one; so is emedicine and (to a degree that surprises even me) Wikipedia. But they all have their problems. UpToDate is very expensive and mostly aimed at doctors; Wikipedia is on average very good but high-variance and proooobably not the sort of thing you want to make life-and-death decisions based on; <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/">emedicine</a> is nice but the more second (and third, and so on) opinions you can get the better. And none of them are guaranteed to have exactly what you want &#8211; for example, when I was looking into antioxidants, none of them really analyzed the important and controversial SUVIMAX study, which I really would have appreciated some good commentary on.</p>
<p>If MetaMed can supplement some of those with its own brand of rationalist medical analysis, it will be a good thing. If it can fill a slightly different niche by doing personalized medical research on issues other information sources might lack for people with a little more money to spend, it will be a very good thing. And Zvi, Alyssa, Vassar, Sarah, et al seem to have even more ambitious &#8211; some would say wildly ambitious &#8211; plans for it which I don&#8217;t know much about except that I can think of much worse groups of people to be setting the future direction of the health care industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Those of you who know me in real life know that I graduated from an Irish medical school  last year but wasn&#8217;t able to get a US residency (ie entry-level doctor job) at the time.</p>
<p>This year I&#8217;m trying again. I&#8217;ll hear back from hospitals in mid-March. I think I have a good chance.</p>
<p>But a good chance is not a perfect chance. And a non-perfect chance means there is some chance of failure. And this is utterly terrifying to me, to the point where I&#8217;m literally having nightmares about it and going a little bit off the wall.</p>
<p>The problem is that these job opportunities only come around once a year, and that if I fail a second time there&#8217;s not a lot of reason to think I&#8217;d do any better next year. In fact, there are a lot of reasons to think I wouldn&#8217;t; hospitals are usually less willing to accept people the longer they&#8217;ve been away from medical school, and they&#8217;re usually less willing to evaluate people they&#8217;ve already evaluated before and rejected. And there aren&#8217;t that many hospitals offering residencies.</p>
<p>So if I don&#8217;t get a job this time, I&#8217;m going to have to seriously consider the possibility that four years and thousands of dollars worth of medical school were a total loss career-wise and that I&#8217;m going to have to do something else. And I have degrees in philosophy and psychology and not a whole lot of obvious marketable skills. I will be totally back at square one with no idea of what to do with my life.</p>
<p>The rest of this entry is really emo and privileged and people who are actually having serious life crises will find it enraging, so if that&#8217;s you please don&#8217;t read it.</p>
<p>I am very lucky and grateful to have amazingly generous and far-sighted parents and grandparents who among many other things gave me saving bonds every birthday as a child which have since spent twenty-five years maturing. As a result, I don&#8217;t have the problems with medical school loans that you were probably expecting this post to be about, and I have enough money to live comfortably for some time period greater than a year and less than forever. So there will be no immediate crisis. I even have enough money (and/or loan-take-out-ability) to go back to school if I need to. But there is a definite long term &#8220;I should probably get a career path or something&#8221;.</p>
<p>And since I expect my mental state to be way too shattered to do any kind of planning or decision-making if I do get rejected, I figure I should figure out a backup plan now while I&#8217;m still sane so I can carry it out on autopilot if worst comes to worst.</p>
<p>I love working for MetaMed, but they are a very ambitious startup and it seems unwise to bank my entire ability to survive or ever have a career on them sticking around. Besides, just in case they get tired of me<a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/02/17/90-of-all-claims-about-the-problems-with-medical-studies-are-wrong/#comment-80"> accidentally misrepresenting their positions</a> or projecting general cluelessness at them, I should try not to have all my eggs in one basket. MetaMed has thus far not had more work for me than I can do in free time between other obligations, so &#8220;continue working for MetaMed but figure out something else to do full time&#8221; seems like an obvious best strategy.</p>
<p>It would be nice to work for MIRI in some way. I have a lot of friends who have positions sifting through academic literature for them, and it seems possible I could get something like this if I begged hard enough. But this seems a lot like MetaMed in being a good part-time addition to my workload and not a stable long-term career plan. Harder to explain but more importantly, I think a lot of my sense of &#8220;I am useful to people and not just a parasite on the world&#8221; would come from being able to donate some of what I made to charity, and if I&#8217;m taking my money from what is possibly the most efficient charity already this becomes kind of a farce. Probably also a &#8220;good if it works, but do in between something else&#8221; option.</p>
<p>I would really like something where my MD is not completely irrelevant. Glibly dismissing &#8220;sunk cost fallacy&#8221; ignores the likely fragility of my mental state and the fact that my parents and family are also going to feel much better if all the work they put into helping me through medical school isn&#8217;t just tossed aside. I have heard that many MDs go on to do a Masters in Public Health. This seems to be only a one to two year course, which is at least a heck of a lot better than having to spend another four years in school. Problem is, I have no idea what a Master of Public Health does, and whether there are likely to be any jobs in it. Anyone here have any experience in that area?</p>
<p>I feel overprivileged just writing this, but I could always just take the LSAT. I&#8217;ve been told that lawyers with MDs can get cushy positions in medical law, and although this sort of offends my sense of ethics and not-being-parasitic, a sufficiently good job could give me enough money to donate to charity to make up for that. I know it&#8217;s hard for lawyers to find jobs nowadays, but I&#8217;ve heard if you go to a good enough law school it&#8217;s still not so bad. I could plausibly hope for exceptional LSAT scores &#8211; I got a perfect score on the SAT verbal which I hear is similar &#8211; so that plus my MD might be enough to get me in somewhere really good. Then again, it&#8217;s another four years of very expensive education once again without a guaranteed job at the end of it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard another route some MDs go if they can&#8217;t get into clinical medicine is getting an MBA and going into some form of medical business. The fact that I have no idea what forms of medical business exist seems to put me at a disadvantage compared to people who have been wanting to do this their whole lives, plus I think everyone who knows me agrees I would be the worst businessman ever (&#8220;Honestly, as far as I can tell the evidence for our product working isn&#8217;t that robust, and I&#8217;m not sure it meets your particular needs anyway&#8221;). This is also one where I&#8217;m concerned about whether I would have a good shot at a job at the end of it. Getting business jobs seems to require networking and self-selling and self-confidence other things I am totally unable to do.</p>
<p>I really like biostatistics. I just happen to be really, really bad at it. I can fake writing about them pretty well, but in terms of actual number crunching they sort of slip out of my mental grasp just like all other math. I&#8217;m not sure whether going back to school to become a statistician would force me to learn it, or just end up with me failing out of school and being even worse off than I started. Also, once again I really don&#8217;t know anything about the state of the job market here.</p>
<p>That leaves non-medical jobs. Mike Blume pushes his idea of &#8220;learn programming on your own and make money as a programmer&#8221;, and I have to admit it worked for him and that programming strikes me as an extremely honest job with good working conditions. On the other hand,  I don&#8217;t know if companies actually give programming jobs to people with no experience beyond independent study, and I don&#8217;t know if I could actually teach myself programming. People say that programming is easy and any smart person can learn to do it, but these same people also tend to say that math is easy and any smart person can learn to do it, which makes me think either they&#8217;re just wrong or that I don&#8217;t qualify for the current definition of &#8220;smart person&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always sort of wanted to be a teacher, and it&#8217;s a decent-paying, decent-status, not-*too*-unethical job. The fields that I would probably be really good at teaching (history, English, etc) are totally jobless, but I&#8217;ve heard there&#8217;s a big demand for math teachers. I&#8217;m bad at math compared to genuine math geeks, but I bet I could be better than high school students and probably better than the average math teacher right now (seriously, some of them are horrible), so going to school to get a teaching credential seems like a good non-medical option.</p>
<p>There are also some super extra backup options, like just going back to Japan and seeing if my old English teaching job is still available and whether I can just do that for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m kind of curious if there are any obvious low-hanging fruit jobs around right now. People used to say that it was both easy and lucrative to become an actuary and they had relatively good working environment/status, but that loophole in the rat race seems to have closed up now. All the ones I know about now (Australian outback, etc) seem more like summer jobs for college students than lifetime careers. Are there any I&#8217;m missing?</p>
<p>Right now, if I don&#8217;t get a job I think my plan is to stay in Berkeley until June, possibly studying just enough programming to see whether I have any aptitude for it. Then do some clinical rotations in Internal Medicine at any hospital that will take me over the summer to see if maybe the Internal Medicine people are mysteriously more favorably disposed to me than the Psychiatry people. Once the summer winds down and the hospitals kick me out for their normal set of med students, I could spend the autumn applying to, in order of desirability: Internal Medicine residencies if they seem mysteriously well disposed to me, medical externships (yearlong unpaid medical resume builders), law schools, MPH programs, MBA programs, and whoever trains teachers (note to self: look that up). Then wait until next March and take the best thing I get into. If I get into literally nothing, and I have aptitude for programming, go into that. Otherwise, move back to Japan (or Korea? or Arabia?) and teach English (or stick around and work for MetaMed if they&#8217;re successful) to earn enough money to subsist while I continue applying to things.</p>
<p>This is a bad plan. I do not like it. I really really hope I get a residency in this year&#8217;s Match.</p>
