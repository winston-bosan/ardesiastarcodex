										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><font size="1"><i>[with apologies to the real <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/13/book-review-legal-systems-very-different-from-ours/">Legal Systems Very Different From Ours</A>. See also the <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/10/25/list-of-fictional-drugs-banned-by-the-fda/">List Of Fictional Drugs Banned By The FDA</A>]</i></font></p>
<p><b>I.</b></p>
<p>The Clamzorians are animists. They believe every rock and tree and river has its own spirit. And those spirits are legal people. This on its own is not unusual &#8211; <A HREF="http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200319-the-new-zealand-river-that-became-a-legal-person">even New Zealand</A> gives rivers legal personhood. But in Clamzoria, if a flood destroys your home, you sue the river.</p>
<p>If you win, then the river is in debt to you. The government can assign a guardian to the river to force it to pay off its debts, and that guardian gets temporary custody of all the river&#8217;s property. He or she can collect a toll from boats, sell water to reservoirs, and charge rent to hydroelectric dams. Once the river has paid off its debt, the guardian is discharged, and the river becomes free to use once again.</p>
<p>Clamzorian precedent governs when you may or may not sue objects. If you swim in the freezing river in the dead of winter, and catch cold, that&#8217;s on you. But if a hurricane destroys your property, you can absolutely sue the wind for damages, and collect from windmills. Suits against earthquakes, volcanoes, and the like are dead common. Suits against diseases happen occasionally. Sometimes someone will sue something even more abstract &#8211; a custom, an emotion, a concept.</p>
<p>Legend tells of a lawyer who once sued Death itself for wrongful death, a class action suit on behalf of everyone who ever lived. The judge found in favor of the plaintiff, but the appointed custodian despaired at ever collecting the judgment &#8211; the few morticians and undertakers in the realm couldn&#8217;t afford even a fraction of the damages. In a stroke of genius, he went after the military, and charged them for the right to kill enemy soldiers. The military grumbled, but eventually gave in: fair is fair.</p>
<p><b>II.</b></p>
<p>Fixed fines are inherently unfair to the poor. If you fine people $50 for running a red light, you&#8217;ve charged someone who makes $10,000 0.5% of their income, but someone who makes $100,000 gets off with only 0.05% of their income.</p>
<p>But prison sentences are inherently unfair to the rich. After all, if you already live in a crowded slum much like a prison cell, and your life is prison-level boring and oppressive already, then going to prison barely costs you anything. But if you live in a mansion and spend all day indulging in the finest luxuries on offer, going to prison is a massive decrease in your quality of life.</p>
<p>The people of Pohjankaupunki thought long and hard about this problem, and came up with a solution: crimes will be punished by neither fines nor prison. They will be punished by government mandated prescription of rimonabant, a prodepressant medication which directly saps your ability to feel happiness. Running a red light may get you 5 mg rimonabant for a month. Murder may get you 80 mg rimonabant twice a day for ten years.</p>
<p>There is no capital punishment in Pohjankaupunki, but if a criminal decides to commit suicide rather than continue to take their medication, they are considered to have voluntarily upgraded to the death penalty, and their debt to the state has been repaid.</p>
<p><b>III.</b></p>
<p>Sloviria is an enlightened country. They do not blame criminals for their actions. They realize it is Society&#8217;s fault for making criminals that way. So when someone commits a crime, they punish Society.</p>
<p>Sloviria is very technologically advanced, with plenty of social networking sites and GPS tracking of cell phones and all the other systems that create a nice objective social graph. When someone commits a crime, the government lets them go free, and punishes everyone else, in proportion to how close they were to the offender on the social graph. If the punishment for a certain crime is a $1000 fine, perhaps each of their parents and their partner pays $200, their boss and best friend pay $100, some of their teachers a few tenners each, and more distant friends and relations a few dollars or less. If a friend of a friend who you met at a dinner party once commits murder, you may be out a couple of cents.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t to say perpetrators get off scot-free; Sloviria isn&#8217;t <i>that</i> enlightened. The punishment for perpetrators is that nobody wants to interact with them, for fear that they might perpetrate again. Once a person is a known criminal &#8211; or a suspected criminal, or just the sort of person who seems like they might become a criminal &#8211; their friends, families, and business relations shun them, trying to minimize their potential loss. This threat alone is enough to discourage crime and every form of crime-adjacent misbehavior.</p>
<p>The Slovirian Radical Party is even more enlightened than Sloviria as a whole, and opposes social punishment. They believe that such punishment prevents rehabilitation, since criminals and at-risk youth find it impossible to make the connections they need to succeed, and are forced to hang out with other people as criminal as themselves. They propose a complete inversion of Sloviria&#8217;s justice system; when anyone commits a crime, the people closest to them are <i>rewarded</i>. They envision a future where, once somebody shows any sign of being at risk for antisocial behavior, they are love-bombed by dozens of people hoping to get rich off their acquaintance, people who want to employ them, adopt them, date them, or just serve as mentors and parental figures. But wouldn&#8217;t all these people encourage the potential criminal to offend? The Radicals debate this among themselves, with one solution being that <i>this</i> could just be a perfectly normal crime punished by jail time.</p>
<p><b>IV.</b></p>
<p>Nova-Nishistan&#8217;s legal system is based on blackmail. It&#8217;s not <i>just</i> blackmail. There are courts and jails and so on. But few people use them. If you have evidence that someone committed a crime, you are expected to threaten to report them unless they give you money.</p>
<p>The system has many advantages. The person most likely to have evidence of a crime is the victim. The victim can choose how much money they want as damages, and have a good chance of receiving it. Fines are automatically calibrated to the wealth of the victim, so poor people are not stuck with debts that are impossible to pay. If a crime is victimless, or the victim chooses not to prosecute, any other witnesses are incentivized to take up the cause of punishing the wrongdoer of their own initiative. Few crimes make it to the courts or prisons, so everyone is assured a speedy trial and an jail cell free of overcrowding. </p>
<p>In order to maintain their system, the Nova-Nishistanis need many laws related to blackmail itself. One of their most serious crimes is to blackmail someone, receive the requested ransom, but report them anyway; anyone convicted of this will be in for a lengthy prison sentence. Indefinite blackmail &#8211; &#8220;pay me $100 now, but I might ask for more later&#8221; &#8211; is forbidden. So is non-monetary blackmail; too easy to abuse. There are a host of similar regulations.</p>
<p>One regulation they don&#8217;t need is laws about retaliating against blackmailers. You might expect this to be a problem &#8211; blackmailing the mob sounds pretty scary. But there are lots of individuals, companies, and (let&#8217;s face it) rival gangs happy to provide dead-man&#8217;s-switch-as-a-service. Tell them your secret (which they promise not to disclose without your consent), and if anything happens to you, they prosecute it. Even better, if anything happens to you, they&#8217;re almost guaranteed to investigate your death, since their special evidence gives them a leg up in what could be a very lucrative blackmail case.</p>
<p>Of course, this only works on people who are rational enough to respond to incentives. If someone is a complete unpredictable psycho, you probably don&#8217;t want to try blackmailing them, even with a dead-man&#8217;s-switch as insurance. But these are probably the people who should be in jail anyway!</p>
<p><b>V.</b></p>
<p>The people of Bogolia thought it was unfair that rich people could hire better lawyers than poor people. But they didn&#8217;t want to take the authoritarian step of banning rich people from buying good lawyers, if they thought skilled representation was important. Instead, they just mandated that in any legal case, both sides had to have equally-priced counsel. A rich person could hire as expensive a defense attorney as they wanted, as long as they donated an equal sum to the plaintiff to hire star attorneys of their own. You could sue someone with as highly-priced an attorney as you wanted, but you needed to give them the same amount to spend on their defense.</p>
<p>(this rule applied to the state too, and so implied the right to a public defender worth however much the state was paying to prosecute you, even if you were poor and couldn&#8217;t otherwise afford one)</p>
<p>Some trolls tried launching hundreds of frivolous lawsuits against companies they didn&#8217;t like, assuming that the company would have to pay both sides of the lawsuit and eventually go broke. They were punished through the normal anti-frivolous-lawsuit rules, and it turned out that companies that did not go broke having to pay one side of a lawsuit don&#8217;t go broke having to pay both sides either.</p>
<p>But there were some weirder unintended consequences. How good a lawyer to get became a highly strategic decision for rich clients facing poorer ones. If you thought you were in the right, you&#8217;d get a good lawyer, since two equally good lawyers facing off will likely produce truth. If you thought you were in the wrong, you&#8217;d try to get a crappy lawyer, since then your opponent would also have a crappy lawyer, and two crappy lawyers facing off will likely produce random results. Not paying for a good lawyer started to be seen as an admission that one&#8217;s case was weak.</p>
<p>But also, lawyer salaries started to get wacky. If a random criminal hurt a rich person somehow, and the rich person hired a good lawyer, the random criminal might receive tens of thousands of dollars to spend on legal advice. But random criminals generally are not savvy at evaluating lawyer skill, so thousands of predatory lawyers sprang up, willing to cater to these people by looking impressive and accepting very high salaries. For the savviest of political operators, an equal and opposite caste of underpriced lawyers sprang up, who would accept very low pay in exchange for vague social credit to be doled out later. More and more political scandals started to center on prestigious lawyers defending politicians for free in exchange for favors, and so depriving the opposing party of their right to equally-matched counsel.</p>
<p>Finally the authorities handed down a change to the system: the plaintiff and defendant would agree on two lawyers to conduct the trial. Then the judge would flip a coin, and one of the two would be assigned at random to each party.</p>
<p><b>VI.</b></p>
<p>Sanzorre accidentally became <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/18/book-review-the-machinery-of-freedom/">an anarcho-capitalist state</A> under the dominion of malpractice insurance companies.</p>
<p>They started off by insuring doctors. Doctors know a bad malpractice case could ruin them. And although being a good doctor helps, it&#8217;s not 100%. Even the best doctor can get unlucky, or have somebody with a grudge fabricate a case against them. For that matter, even very bad doctors can get lucky and never have to deal with a case at all. So doctors have malpractice insurance, and if they seem to be practicing medicine badly their insurance company will raise their premiums.</p>
<p>This worked well enough that other industries started adopting it too. If a factory&#8217;s pollutant byproducts got discovered to cause cancer ten years later, their industrial malpractice insurance would pay for it. If someone slipped and fell and broke their back on a restaurant floor, their restaurant malpractice insurance would pay for it. Of course, these insurance companies worked closely with factories to monitor how many they were polluting, and gave discounts to restaurants which followed best practices on floor cleaning.</p>
<p>Finally, they branched out to serving ordinary people. If you accidentally hit someone&#8217;s dog with your car and got sued for damages, better to have a personal malpractice insurance pay them than get hit for tens of thousands of dollars yourself. Having malpractice insurance became to Sanzorrians what having health insurance is to Americans &#8211; a necessity if you don&#8217;t want to court disaster.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs in all these cases were usually being covered by lawyers who took contigency fees. But as malpractice insurance companies became better at their jobs, the contingency fees began to dry up. Finally, lobbyists from the insurance companies got contingency fees banned entirely. This presented a dilemma for ordinary people with grievances against bad actors. Thus the rise of the grievance insurance.</p>
<p>If you suffered harm from a doctor&#8217;s medical error, and had grievance insurance, the insurance company would pay the cost of the malpractice suit. If you were poisoned by industrial runoff, the insurance company would pay the cost of suing the factory. Grievance insurance soon became as essential as malpractice insurance. Without it, you wouldn&#8217;t be able to stand up for your rights.</p>
<p>Like malpractice insurance, grievance insurance was only available cheaply to people who agreed to avoid risks. If you wanted to be able to sue for malpractice, you had to avoid going to quacks. If you wanted to be able to sue factories for pollution, you couldn&#8217;t live right next to a coal plant. Gradually, grievance insurances placed more and more restrictions on people&#8217;s behavior, and people generally complied.</p>
<p>As malpractice insurances incentivized potential defendants to avoid actions that could harm others, and grievance insurances incentivized individuals to avoid risk, the number of lawsuits gradually got fewer and fewer. Those that happened were generally settled between malpractice insurers and grievance insurers, without ever having to go to court, and sometimes with both companies changing their policy to avoid repeats in the future. Soon, even this formality was eliminated &#8211; each malpractice insurance company paid a negotiated amount to each grievance insurance company each year, and the grievance insurance company paid complainants from its own bank account as per its own policies whenever they complained.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t quite full anarcho-capitalism. The state still intervened in a few very serious crimes, like murder. But the insurance companies had replaced the civil courts and the regulatory apparatus, and controlled every aspect of doing business.</p>
<p><b>VII.</b></p>
<p>Modern philosophy says that formal systems are bunk. The dream of reducing the complexity of reality to some mere set of rules is a childish desire reminiscent of the fascists and high modernists of the early 20th century. Enlightened thinkers realize that we need a Kegan 5 type fluid ability to transcend systematicity. So the people of Mirakoth don&#8217;t have laws. They&#8217;re just supposed to not do bad stuff.</p>
<p>If someone in Mirakoth thinks someone else did something bad, they can bring it before a council of seven judges. If a majority of the judges think it was bad, they can assign whatever seems to them like fair punishment. If the loser appeals, it goes to a larger council of forty-nine judges. If they think it was bad, it was bad. These judges are under no obligation to follow precedent or any particular philosophy. They&#8217;re just supposed to be in favor of good stuff and against bad stuff.</p>
<p>In order to prevent people from seeking out judges who agree with them, each case is assigned seven judges at random. All cases are tried by videoconference, to make sure the judge pool is unlimited by geographical mobility. If the judges think a case is frivolous, they can choose to punish the person who brought the case.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t this create such paralyzing uncertainty that nobody knows if they can do anything at all? Not really. Controversial cases are more likely to go to the full 49 judge panel. If an opinion is only held by 20% of judges in the country, then there&#8217;s only about a 1 in a million chance that the panel will rule in favor. Even if the opinion is held by 40%, it&#8217;s still only an 8% chance of winning. So just don&#8217;t do things that more than 40% of people think are bad, and you&#8217;ll be fine!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>I.</b></p>
<p>The man standing outside my front door was carrying a clipboard and wearing a golden robe. &#8220;Not interested,&#8221; I said, preparing to slam the door in his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; said the acolyte. Before I could say no he&#8217;d jammed a wad of $100 bills into my hand. &#8220;If this will buy a few moments of your time.&#8221;</p>
<p>It did, if only because I stood too flabbergasted to move. Surely they didn&#8217;t have enough money to do this for everybody.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no everybody,&#8221; said the acolyte, when I expressed my bewilderment. &#8220;You&#8217;re the last one. The last unenlightened person in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it sort of made sense. Twenty years ago, a group of San Francisco hippie/yuppie/techie seekers had pared down the ancient techniques to their bare essentials, then optimized <i>hard</i>. A combination of drugs, meditation, and ecstatic dance that could catapult you to enlightenment in the space of a weekend retreat, 100% success rate. Their cult/movement/startup, the Order Of The Golden Lotus, spread like wildfire through California &#8211; a state where wildfires spread even faster than usual &#8211; and then on to the rest of the world. Soon investment bankers and soccer moms were showing up to book clubs talking about how they had grasped the peace beyond understanding and vanquished their ego-self.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d kind of ignored it. Actually, super ignored it. First a flat refusal to attend Golden Lotus retreats. Then slamming the door in their face whenever their golden-robed pamphleteers came to call. Then quitting my job to live off savings after my coworkers started converting and the team-building exercises turned into meditation sessions. Then unplugging my cable box after the sitcoms started incorporating Golden Lotus themes and the national news started being about how peaceful everybody was all the time. After that I might have kind of become a complete recluse, never leaving the house, ordering meals through UberEats, cut off from noticing any of the changes happening outside except through the gradual disappearance of nonvegetarian restaurants on the app.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a bigot; people can have whatever religion they choose. But Golden Lotus wasn&#8217;t for me. I don&#8217;t want to be enlightened. I like being an individual with an ego. Ayn Rand loses me when she starts talking politics, but the stuff about selfishness really speaks to me. Tend to your own garden, that kind of thing. I&#8217;m not becoming part of some universal-love-transcendent-joy hive mind, and I&#8217;m not interested in what Golden Lotus is selling.</p>
<p>So I just said: &#8220;Cool. Do I get a medal?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is actually very serious,&#8221; said the acolyte. &#8220;Do you know about the Bodhisattva&#8217;s Vow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The what now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s from ancient China. You say it before embarking on the path of enlightenment. &#8216;However innumerable sentient beings are, I vow to save them all.&#8217; The idea is that we&#8217;re all in this together. We swear that we will not fully forsake this world of suffering and partake of the ultimate mahaparanirvana &#8211; complete cosmic bliss &#8211; until everyone is as enlightened as we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cool story.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That means 7.5 billion people are waiting on <i>you</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We all swore not to sit back and enjoy enlightenement until everyone was enlightened. Now everyone is enlightened except you. You&#8217;re the only thing holding us all back from ultimate cosmic bliss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Man. I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are forgiven. We would like to offer you a free three-day course with the Head Lama of Golden Lotus to correct the situation. We&#8217;ll pick you up at your home and fly you to the Big Island of Hawaii, where the Head Lama will personally&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;yeah, no thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have to! Nobody else can reach mahaparanirvana until you get enlightened!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure they can. Tell them I&#8217;m okay, they can head off to mahabharata without me, no need to wait up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They <i>can&#8217;t</i>. They <i>swore not to.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they shouldn&#8217;t have done that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s done! It&#8217;s irreversible! The vow has been sworn! Each of the seven point five billion acolytes of Golden Lotus has sworn it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Break it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are enlightened beings! We can&#8217;t break our solemn vow!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I guess you&#8217;re going to learn an important lesson about swearing unbreakable vows you don&#8217;t want to keep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir, this entire planet is heavy with suffering. It groans under its weight. Seven billion people, the entirety of the human race, and for the first time they have the chance to escape together! I understand you&#8217;re afraid of enlightenment, I understand that this isn&#8217;t what you would have chosen, but for the sake of the world, please, accept what must be!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I really am. But the fault here is totally yours. You guys swore an oath conditional on my behavior, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I have to change my behavior to prevent your oath from having bad consequences. Imagine if I let that work! You could all swear to kill yourself unless I donated money, and I&#8217;d have to donate or have billions of deaths on my hands. That kind of reasoning, you&#8217;ve got to nip it in the bud. I&#8217;m sorry about your oath and I&#8217;m sorry you&#8217;re never going to get to Paramaribo but I don&#8217;t want to be enlightened and you can&#8217;t make me.&#8221;</p>
<p>I slammed the door in his face.</p>
<p><b>II.</b></p>
<p>A few days later, just as I was trying to order lunch on UberEats, my cell phone internet stopped working. I tried my laptop. Wasn&#8217;t working either. iPad? Not working.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d been wondering whether Golden Lotus was going to kill me. It was the natural thing to try in this situation. But I figured people who were too enlightened to break a vow were probably too enlightened to murder me, or to threaten to break my kneecaps, or to drug me, or to take any of the other easy ways out.</p>
<p>But starving me &#8211; that might work. And if everyone else was a Golden Lotuser at this point, they were like a world state. They probably controlled the infrastructure, and I didn&#8217;t think there were any ancient Buddhist commandments against shutting off someone&#8217;s internet connection.</p>
<p>There was a 7-11 on the corner of my street. I put on a jacket, prayed to any god who would listen to me right now, and walked outside.</p>
<p>My street, as I remembered it, was gone. The familiar buildings had been torn down. Far away, I could see tranquil gardens and intricate pagodas. But the street I was on &#8211; the one between my apartment and 7-11 &#8211; had been turned into a gauntlet. A series of flashing, attention-grabbing billboards and video-screens explaining Golden Lotus techniques, the virtues of enlightenment, and the illusory nature of the material world, accompanied by a soundtrack of giant speakers blaring sermons.</p>
<p>So this was their plan. Not very subtle, but I could live with it. I stared down at my feet and broke into a run, trying to make it to the store as quickly as possible without absorbing any of the information being blasted at me. Staring at my feet turned out to be a mistake &#8211; there were sutras written all along the pavement. The first giant letter was right past my doormat, and I saw them stretching forward, continuing in order to the 7-11 I was trying to reach. I tried looking up instead, but a transparent canopy placed atop the street was similarly laden with spiritual wisdom. I closed my eyes, but this slowed my progress forward, and made me more vulnerable to sermons coming from the speakers all around me. &#8220;SINGLE-POINTED AWARENESS ON ANY INDIVIDUAL SENSATION REVEALS ITS EMPTINESS!&#8221; blared one. &#8220;THE MIND IS LIKE A STILL POOL DISTURBED BY THE RIPPLES OF THOUGHTS&#8221; blasted another. </p>
<p>I thought about the technical problem facing Golden Lotus leadership: how do you enlighten someone who resists enlightenment? You can&#8217;t teach them practices, because they won&#8217;t do them. You can&#8217;t impart advice, because they won&#8217;t take it. But you can draw awareness to certain facets of their own thinking, along the lines of the old &#8220;You are now aware of the feeling of your tongue in your mouth&#8221;. You can present someone with metaphors of such explanatory value that they reshape the way he interprets his own experience. If you had a lot of very smart people developing the &#8220;curriculum&#8221;, and a lot of patience, maybe it could work.</p>
<p>How could one resist such an effort? I would have to close all possible communication channels. I put my hands over my ears, even though the awkward position slowed my blind stumble to the store. I took a few steps forward, then felt a sudden weight. I opened my eyes. A brightly-colored macaw had landed on my right shoulder and was staring straight at me. &#8220;HERE AND NOW!&#8221; it screeched, point-blank, before flying off.</p>
<p>Okay. Trained birds. They were really on top of their game. So maybe I couldn&#8217;t close off all possible communication channels. Maybe I would have to fight them on their own turf. Maybe if they&#8217;ve created a super-efficient science of enlightenment, I would have to create a super-efficient science of samsara.</p>
<p>The convenience store sold mostly rice and incense now, and restricted rice purchases to a single day&#8217;s supply. I picked some up and headed for the cashier. The aisles were confusingly laid out, and I realized after a moment that they formed one of those labyrinths that people sometimes walk as a spiritual practice. I didn&#8217;t think those things worked, but I couldn&#8217;t take any chances. I climbed a shelf full of meditation cushions, vaulted over, and climbed down the other side to the frowning cashier. </p>
<p>I saw another door on the other side of the 7-11, this one guarded by a stern-looking man in a golden robe. I realized it was the door to freedom &#8211; outside my enlightenment-ad-plastered prison and into the world of pagodas and gardens outside. I assessed my chances. The monk was really big, and I didn&#8217;t know if the door was locked or if there were other guards on the other side. I decided against it. I paid for my rice, stuffed enough of it in my pockets that I could reassume the hands-over-ears-eyes-closed pose, and walked home.</p>
<p>A science of samsara. What would that involve? Instead of meditating on lovingkindness, I could meditate on everybody I hated. Instead of a vow of poverty, I could take a vow of greed. Instead of practicing self-awareness, I could practice self-obliviousness. I took out a piece of paper and began to jot some of this down. This was going to be <i>so much fun</i>.</p>
<p><b>III.</b></p>
<p>I was at the 7-11, buying a meditation cushion. My meditation on hatred was going well, but sitting on the floor that long was starting to hurt my back. I figured that on my daily rice run, I&#8217;d get a cushion, a bell, maybe some looser-fitting clothes. I was near the center of the labyrinth, picking them out, when someone tapped me on the shoulder.</p>
<p>It was the most beautiful woman I&#8217;d ever seen. She looked like a supermodel or something. She whispered to me. &#8220;Are you&#8230;the unenlightened person?&#8221;</p>
<p>I nodded, wondering where she was going with this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have not had decent sex in a year and a half. Everyone is just like &#8216;abandon carnal desires of the flesh&#8217; and &#8216;real pleasure comes from within&#8217;. And even when I can rope some guy into doing it, somehow it manages to be <i>tranquil</i>.&#8221; She spat out this last word. &#8220;Are you&#8230;uh&#8230;are you free tonight?&#8221;</p>
<p>I controlled my shock at my good fortune long enough to sputter out a short &#8220;yes&#8221;.</p>
<p>We stumbled back to my apartment together, braving the billboards and sermons and dive-bomb-parrots. In record time we made it to my bedroom and started ripping our clothes off.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you get in?&#8221; I asked her. &#8220;Is this place well-guarded?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a door in the back of the 7-11,&#8221; she said, confirming my suspicions. &#8220;There&#8217;s one monk and your side, and about five on the other. There&#8217;s no restriction on people coming in to talk to you if they want. Only on you getting out.&#8221;</p>
<p>I pulled her onto the bed and into my embrace.</p>
<p>&#8220;You feel so good,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s like a snake, coiled at the bottom of the spine, waiting to get out. Oh! It&#8217;s like the snake is made of energy, and the energy is escaping, moving upward&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>That sounded familiar. I stopped, pushed her off me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a second,&#8221; I said. &#8220;That&#8217;s from tantric sex!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tantric sex?&#8221; she asked innocently. &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t pretend you don&#8217;t know what tantric sex is! It&#8217;s that thing where sex can be used as a spiritual practice that brings people to enlightenment! You&#8217;re trying to trick me!&#8221;</p>
<p>She pouted seductively. &#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s keep going.&#8221;</p>
<p>I started putting my clothes back on. &#8220;You guys are scared of me. You&#8217;re scared that you&#8217;re not reaching me, that I&#8217;m immune to your tricks. Well, tell them that they&#8217;re going to have to try harder. Every day I meditate for an hour on all the people I hate, then another hour on all the material goods I wish I had, then for another hour on all the women I want to screw. Then I finish it off with an hour trying to experience selfhood as viscerally and dramatically as possible. I&#8217;m reaching depths of samsara they can&#8217;t even imagine. And there&#8217;s nothing you or the Head Lama or anyone else can do about it. Get out!&#8221; I threw her clothes at her. When she left, I slammed the door in her face.</p>
<p><b>IV.</b></p>
<p>A knock on the door.</p>
<p>I got up from my meditation cushion, eyeing the stains and scratches on it. Twenty years. Twenty years I had kept up my meditation practice, the four hours of anger-greed-lust-selfhood meditation I&#8217;d established a few weeks after my confinement started. To be honest, I didn&#8217;t look much better than the cushion. I was getting old. My rice and tap water diet kept me lean and wiry, but the years still took their toll. There were no razors at the 7-11, so I had grown a long white beard.</p>
<p>For the first few years, Golden Lotus had tried more tricks like the supermodel. I had seen through them all. Eventually they must have given up. I&#8217;d been unmolested for more than a decade. I wondered what they were up to now.</p>
<p>At the door was a kid. There was no other way to describe him. Scrawny, a little worn-out, looked South Asian, maybe sixteen or seventeen. He was wearing some kind of black plastic poncho over his clothes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Are you the unenlightened man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to learn from you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Master, until now I have lived an unexamined life. Going to temple every day, meditating, taking the drugs, doing the dances. But I longed for something more. In an old library, I found a book which claimed the ancients knew of a state known as samsara, and of a mystery called the Self. That those who master these mysteries gain strange powers. Using the technique of Greed, they can attain such perfect willpower that they can work eighty hour weeks for abusive bosses without quitting. Using the technique of Lust, they can reach such perfect focus that all their thoughts for months revolve around the same person.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it might all just be legends. But I asked those who knew more than I did, and they directed me to those who knew more than them, and finally I heard rumors that in a far-off place called California there was an ancient sage who had achieved samsara long ago. Please, Master, will you take me as your disciple?&#8221;</p>
<p>I was flabbergasted for just a second before common sense took hold of me once again. &#8220;No,&#8221; I said. &#8220;You&#8217;re some kind of trick. Go away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Master!&#8221; protested the kid. &#8220;I will wait kneeling on your doorstep without food or water until you agree to take me as a disciple!&#8221;</p>
<p>I shrugged and closed the door.</p>
<p>The next day, when I went out to 7-11, the kid was still there, kneeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Master!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Please take me as your disciple.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I said. &#8220;But if you want to make yourself useful, you can help guide me to the corner store while I have my eyes closed and my hands over my ears. And if you see any parrots, fight them off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Master!&#8221; said the kid, and he took me by the arm and helped guide me to 7-11.</p>
<p>The next day the same thing happened. I went to go to the store, the kid was waiting on my doorstep, and he helped guide me to 7-11 safely. By the time I got back it was raining, and although the transparent canopy covered with sutra verses blocked out the worst of it, there was still a chill in the air.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might as well come inside and sleep on the couch,&#8221; I told him. &#8220;And have a little of the rice.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next morning, we began his training. I asked him to think about all the material goods he wanted. He couldn&#8217;t come up with any. I asked him to think about all the most attractive women he knew. He said he&#8217;d never thought about women that way before, and it seemed kind of objectifying. I asked him who really pissed him off, and his only answer was himself, when he strayed from the path of maximum virtue.</p>
<p>I tried for a few hours, then I gave up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to the spare room,&#8221; I said &#8220;and think about the sound of one hand clapping. Once you figure it out, come tell me. Until then, leave me alone. Got it, uh&#8230;what was your name again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maitrayaniputra,&#8221; said the kid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not anymore,&#8221; I said. &#8220;From now on, your name is Brad.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>V.</b></p>
<p>Somehow, my fame spread.</p>
<p>My apartment-street-convenience-store prison had turned into a makeshift ashram. Two dozen seekers from all around the globe. A select few slept in my house. The rest pitched tents on the street, or huddled into the aisles of the 7-11. The guard on the back door stared at them impassively, but said nothing.</p>
<p>I tried to discourage them, turn them away. But every time I yelled at one, or hit her with my cane, or slapped him on the face, more kept coming, sure this was some manifestation of ancient wisdom. A few gave up and returned back through the guarded door; but overall the numbers grew and grew.</p>
<p>Brad had declared himself chief of my disciples, the Peter to my Jesus. He would lead the congregation in meditation each morning, drawing off my old morning routine &#8211; an hour thinking of all the people they were angry at, an hour thinking of the material goods they wanted, an hour thinking of all the sexy people they wanted to screw &#8211; followed by a final hour of meditation on the Self. The novices failed in ways I didn&#8217;t even think possible. All the material goods they wanted were things like lotuses and celestial jewels. All the people they wanted to have sex with were particularly virtuous saints whose wisdom they admired. Sometimes, I would march into the room and demand to know what a novice was thinking. &#8220;Who are you having sexual fantasies about?&#8221; I shouted at one young man, who I had given the name Kyle. He admitted he was thinking of the Tibetan Buddhist guru Padmasambhava. &#8220;Are you even gay?&#8221; I demanded. He didn&#8217;t know what that meant, so I explained that some people were straight and should be having fantasies about the opposite sex, and other people were gay and should be having fantasies about the same sex, and other people were bi and could have fantasies about whichever sex they wanted. &#8220;But how would I know which of those I am?&#8221; Kyle asked me. I didn&#8217;t know what to say, so I hit him with my stick and stormed out.</p>
<p>But they kept coming. Kyle left the ashram, only to return a few weeks later with his sister. Her name was Shantideva; I told her she would henceforth be Sherri. Sherri was stick-thin, a dialysis port in one arm, and rarely spoke. Kyle told me she had a rare disease and would die before age 30. She had read Dylan Thomas&#8217; &#8220;Rage Against The Dying Of The Light&#8221; and decided to achieve samsara before she died, so that she too could feel rage at her situation. I was nervous about her &#8211; she looked like the slightest breeze would tip her over &#8211; but she meditated with a fervor beyond anything I could have predicted, sometimes outdoing even Brad in time spent on the cushion.</p>
<p>I instituted a dress code for my disciples. I made the men dress as douchey as possible, and the women as slutty as they could. One day I dug my old printer out of a closet, and ran off a thousand copies of George Washington&#8217;s face. I distributed them to the disciples as unevenly as I could. &#8220;This is money,&#8221; I said. &#8220;It is an important ritual object. From now on, whenever someone wants something from you, you must refuse unless they offer you money. If they don&#8217;t offer you enough money, you should yell at them and call them cheap. If they offer you too much money, you should laugh at them behind their backs and tell everyone they&#8217;re an easy mark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Master,&#8221; protested Kyle, &#8220;why do we need all these rituals? Didn&#8217;t you yourself say that the essence of samsara is about mental states? Aren&#8217;t all these intermediaries and traditions only distracting us from the true work of self-transformation?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will give you $10 to shut up and stop bothering me about this,&#8221; I said, and I handed him ten of the Washington papers.</p>
<p>Kyle slowly nodded and took them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now do you understand?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>Kyle nodded, but I could tell he did not understand.</p>
<p>A few days later, Brad came into my room. I looked up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Master,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There is no sound of one hand clapping. You were just trying to get rid of me. I wasted almost a year of my life trying to figure it out, and there was nothing there. It was all a fraud and you&#8217;re a fraud and this whole piece of shit ashram is a fraud. Fuck you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My son,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Today you have achieved samsara.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brad stopped as if stuck by a train. He tried to speak, then tried again, then fell silent. I watched as understanding flowed into his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You bastard,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You magnificent bastard. You really did it.&#8221; He hugged me. I hugged him back. Then I marched him out to the street, where the majority of the disciples were eating their evening meal. &#8220;Everybody!&#8221; I announced. &#8220;Brad is unenlightened now! That means he&#8217;s better than you! He&#8217;s going to lord it over you, and you should all feel jealous of him!&#8221; A few looks of bewilderment from people who couldn&#8217;t grasp why they should be unhappy at anyone else&#8217;s achievement, but that was fine. I knew I had planted a seed.</p>
<p><b>VI.</b></p>
<p>Years went by. My first disciples &#8211; Brad, Kyle, Sherri, and the rest &#8211; left the ashram to preach to the outside world. New disciples replaced them. Life went on.</p>
<p>I grew into my role as samsara master. If Golden Lotus could enlighten people in a weekend, I needed to be able to unenlighten them faster. I spent more and more time in meditation, probing the true meaning of samsara, investigating each impulse, querying each baser urge. My doctrines became more and more esoteric. I began telling seekers that they were already unenlightened, if only they could see it. That there was nothing to attain. That there was no samsara separate from nirvana.</p>
<p>Some left, unable to handle the paradox. It was one of these, a middle-aged man I had dubbed Logan, who left behind the golden robe.</p>
<p>He had taken off to change it douchey clothes as soon as he arrived. And he left in the douchey clothes I gave him. The golden robe hung in my closet. Nobody missed it. Nobody knew I had it.</p>
<p>I decided to try a jailbreak.</p>
<p>I put on the golden robe. Then I dug up an old razor from the bottom drawer of my bathroom. Then I shaved off my long beard. Then I shaved my head, until I looked the very image of a Golden Lotus monk.</p>
<p>I went out to the 7-11 and walked up to the back door. &#8220;I&#8217;m sick of this place,&#8221; I told the guard. &#8220;I&#8217;m going home.&#8221;</p>
<p>He waved me through, and for the first time in twenty-five years, I stepped into the world beyond.</p>
<p>It looked like a Japanese garden. Bonsai-perfect trees grew everywhere, hanging over glassy ponds stocked with koi. The roads had given way to carefully tended paths, lined every so often by pagodas or temple-like houses.</p>
<p>I walked further, until I reached what had been the town center before. The general aesthetic continued, but the buildings were closer together now. I saw fellow golden-robed acolytes walking the streets or sitting contemplatively beneath the trees.</p>
<p>One golden-robed man sitting underneath a cherry tree looked exactly like Brad. He was talking to another man who looked exactly like Kyle. I could only hear bits of their speech, but it sounded very tranquil. I hid behind a shrine. What was going on here? Was it really them? Had they reverted already?</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry!&#8221; said a jogger, as she almost ran into me. I blinked again, took a second look. It was Sherri, the frail girl with the chronic disease. She didn&#8217;t look frail or diseased now. I grabbed her by the wrist, made her stop.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sherri. What&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</p>
<p>I saw recognition in her eyes, and her lips curled into a smile.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d been right that first time then, all those years ago. A trick. They&#8217;d all been plants. Why? What had they accomplished? <i>Getting me thinking about samsara</i>. I retraced several years worth of mental steps. Trying to understand the nature of desire. Becoming more aware of the movements of my own mind. They had gotten me <i>good</i>. I had to distract myself. Think of a material good. Think of a red Ferrari. I concentrated on a red Ferrari as hard as I could, tried to block everything else out of my mind, all the insights, all the shame, all the trickery. Just a red Ferrari, on a black road, beneath a blue sky. Everything else faded.</p>
<p>Sherri clapped once, right in front of my face.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, I was enlightened.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><font size="1"><i>[With apologies to Putnam, Pope, and all of you]</i></font></p>
<p>Two children are reading a text <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/18/do-neural-nets-dream-of-electric-hobbits/">written by an AI</A>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The boys splashed water in each other&#8217;s faces until they were both sopping wet</p></blockquote>
<p>One child says to the other &#8220;Wow! After reading some text, the AI understands what water is!&#8221;</p>
<p>The second child says &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t <i>really</i> understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first child says &#8220;Sure it does! It understands that water is the sort of substance that splashes. It understands that people who are splashed with water get wet. What else is left to understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>The second child says &#8220;All it understands is relationships between words. None of the words connect to reality. It doesn&#8217;t have any internal concept of what water looks like or how it feels to be wet. Only that the letters W-A-T-E-R, when appearing near the letters S-P-L-A-S-H bear a certain statistical relationship to the letters W-E-T.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first child starts to cry.</p>
<hr>
<p>Two chemists are watching the children argue with each other. The first chemist says &#8220;Wow! After seeing an AI, these kids can debate the nature of water!&#8221;</p>
<p>The second chemist says &#8220;Ironic, isn&#8217;t it? After all, the children themselves don&#8217;t understand what water is! Water is two hydrogen atoms plus one oxygen atom, and neither of them know!&#8221;</p>
<p>The first chemist answers &#8220;Come on. The child knows enough about water to say she understands it. She knows what it looks like. She knows what it tastes like. That&#8217;s pretty much the basics of water.&#8221;</p>
<p>The second chemist answers &#8220;Those are just relationships between pieces of sense-data. The child knows that (visual perception of clear shiny thing) = (tactile perception of cold wetness) = (gustatory perception of refreshingness). And she can predict statistical relationships &#8211; like, if she sees someone throw a bucket of (visual perception of clear shiny thing) at her, she will soon feel (tactile perception of cold miserable sopping wetness). She uses the word &#8220;water&#8221; as a concept-hook that links all of these relationships together and makes predicting the world much easier. But no matter how well she masters these facts, she can never connect them to H2O or any other real chemical facts about the world beyond mere sense-data.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first chemist says &#8220;Maybe she knows things like that water makes iron rust. That&#8217;s a chemical fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>The second chemist says &#8220;No, she knows that (clear shiny appearance + wetness + refreshment) makes (dull metallic appearance + hardness) get (patchy redness). She doesn&#8217;t know that H2O + Fe = iron oxides. She knows many statistical relationships between sense-data, but none of them ever connect to the deeper chemical reality.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first chemist says &#8220;Then on what level can we be said to understand water ourselves? After all, no doubt there are deeper things going on than chemical reactions &#8211; quantum fields, superstrings, levels even deeper than those. All we know are some statistical relationships that must hold true, despite whatever those things may be.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p>Two angels are watching the chemists argue with each other. The first angel says &#8220;Wow! After seeing the relationship between the sensory and atomic-scale worlds, these chemists have realized that there are levels of understanding humans are incapable of accessing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The second angel says &#8220;They haven&#8217;t truly realized it. They&#8217;re just abstracting over levels of relationship between the physical world and their internal thought-forms in a mechanical way. They have no concept of <IMG SRC="http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/angelic1.png"> or <IMG SRC="http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/angelic2.png">. You can&#8217;t even express it in their language!&#8221;</p>
<p>The first angel says &#8220;Yes, but when they use placeholder words like &#8216;levels even deeper than those&#8217;, those placeholders will have the same statistical relationship with the connection between models and reality as <IMG SRC="http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/angelic5.png">.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, which is the difference between being able to respond to &#8216;Marco!&#8217; by shouting &#8216;Polo!&#8221; vs. a deep historical understanding of Europe-Orient trade relations in the Middle Ages. If all you know is that some statistical models are isomorphic to other models and to Creation itself, you still won&#8217;t have the slightest idea what the <IMG SRC="http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/angelic4.png">s of any of them are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not claiming humans really know what anything means,&#8221; said the first angel. &#8220;Just that it&#8217;s impressive you can get that far by manipulating a purely symbolic mental language made of sense-data-derived thought-forms with no connection to real <IMG SRC="http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/angelic3.png"> at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess that is kind of impressive,&#8221; said the second angel. &#8220;For humans.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p>God sits in the highest heaven, alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow!&#8221; He thinks to Himself, &#8220;that cellular automaton sure is producing some pretty patterns today. I wonder what it will do next!&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>I.</b></p>
<p>Chefs. Hundreds of them. Tall chefs, short chefs, black chefs, white chefs. I pushed forward through them, like an explorer hacking away at undergrowth. They muttered curses at me, but I was stronger than they were. I came to a door. I opened it. Sweet empty space. I shut the door behind me, sat down in the chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Detective Paul Eastman, pleased to make your acquaintance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor Zachary LaShay,&#8221; said the man behind the desk. His little remaining hair was greying; his eyes showed hints of the intellect that had been buried beneath the dullness of an administrative career. &#8220;I hope you didn&#8217;t have any trouble getting here. Did my secretary warn you about the chefs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She did not,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, forewarned is forearmed,&#8221; he answered, inanely and incongruously. &#8220;But I trust you got my message about the federal investigators?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Once a federal investigation has started, we&#8217;ll retreat and let them take over. But two women died here. We can&#8217;t just not investigate because you tell us you&#8217;re trying to get the Feds involved.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ah, of course. It&#8217;s just that we&#8217;re a sort of, ah, defense contractor. None of our projects are officially classified, yet, but we were hoping to get someone with a security clearance, in case this touched on sensitive areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t pry further than I have to, but until someone from the government says something official, this is a matter for city police. Maybe you could start by telling me more about exactly what you do here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re the United States&#8217; only proverb laboratory. Our mission is to stress-test the nation&#8217;s proverbs. To provide rigorous backing for the good ones, and weed out the bad ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d never even heard of your organization before today, I have to admit. And now that I&#8217;m here&#8230;it&#8217;s huge! Who pays for all of this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody who uses proverbs,&#8221; said the Doctor, &#8220;which is to say, everybody. Consider: he who hesitates is lost. But also: look before you leap. Suppose you&#8217;re a business executive who spots a time-limited opportunity. What do you do? Hesitate? Or leap without looking? Eggheads devise all sorts of fancy rules about timing the market and relying on studies, but when push comes to shove most people are going to rely on the simple sayings they learned as a child. If you can keep your stock of proverbs more up-to-date than your competitor&#8217;s, that gives you a big business advantage.&#8221;</p>
<p>A smartly-dressed woman came in, handed Dr. LaShay a cup of boiling liquid. He put it to his lips, then spat. &#8220;This is terrible!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Try it!&#8221;</p>
<p>I had been expecting it to be tea, but it wasn&#8217;t. I didn&#8217;t know what it was. But it was terrible. Somehow too plain, too salty, and too bitter all at once. I gagged.</p>
<p>&#8220;That settles it!&#8221; said the Doctor. &#8220;Too many cooks really do spoil the broth. Tricia, tell the chefs they can all go home now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s what you were doing!&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Until now, too many cooks spoiling the broth had been at best an anecdote! A folk hypothesis! This month we&#8217;ve been working on broth with varying numbers of cooks. One, two, five, ten, a hundred. We&#8217;ve got a team of blinded taste testers in the basement who&#8217;ve been rating the results, and I personally check each sample to make sure I agree. This morning we hired every cook in the city &#8211; that&#8217;s over five hundred cooks &#8211; to come here and make broth for us, just to make sure there isn&#8217;t some kind of island of stability where broth starts getting better again once the number of cooks is high enough. Later this week we&#8217;ll give the data over to our analysts, who&#8217;ll develop a model that can use cook number to predict broth quality over a wide range of possible situations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the military wants this sort of thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The military loves it! The average grunt is a high-school educated young man in his late teens or early twenties. You&#8217;re not going to be teaching these people Clausewitz and von Moltke; it would be casting pearls before swine. When he&#8217;s under fire and has to make a split-second decision, he&#8217;s going to rely on the heuristics he learned on his grandmother&#8217;s knee. On proverbs. America&#8217;s proverbs are a vital strategic asset, and the Pentagon appreciates that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I get how <i>too many cooks spoil the broth</i> might apply to something like an officer trying to figure out how many people to consult about a new strategy. But surely you can&#8217;t test that heuristic just by experimenting with literal cooks making literal broth!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mmmmmmm. Yes, you&#8217;re referring to what we call Pragmatics. We certainly have a pragmatics team here, and they do good work. But the thing is, Officer, we&#8217;re essentially a consulting firm. Consulting firms are there to give people justification for the things they want to do anyway. When some general is testifying before Congress, and he says he didn&#8217;t consult someone-or-other because too many cooks spoil the broth, then Congress is going to want evidence that relying on sayings like this is best practice. If he just says &#8220;That&#8217;s our heuristic, and we know it works&#8221;, he&#8217;ll look like a loose cannon. But if he can hold up a glossy five hundred page report we gave him, proving that broth really does get spoiled by too many cooks, he&#8217;ll look like a responsible technocrat who did his due diligence. And yes, part of that report is a long philosophical discussion on pragmatics. But part of it is proving, once and for all, that too many cooks really do spoil the broth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; I said. &#8220;The two dead women. Were they involved in the broth project?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. The first victim, Lisa Bird, she was our sysadmin. The second victim, Catherine Lee, took care of the animals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Animals?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have several projects that require animals. You can obviously lead a horse to water, but can you make him drink? At first we would rent out horses from equestrian organizations for this kind of thing. But then the next month we would need another horse to see if you should shut the stable door after the horse has bolted. Then we&#8217;d need two more horses to see if you should change horses midstream. Finally the costs started adding up and we just got a couple of horses that we keep here at the Institute. They were actually a gift from a sister of one of our employees who used to have a farm. One of them we looked in the mouth; the other we didn&#8217;t. We&#8217;re still trying to figure out which way worked better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. The report I got said that the motive was romantic jealousy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Ms. Lee believed Ms. Bird was having an affair with her husband. Ms. Bird was known to come to work early on Fridays to do some extra work and prepare for the weekend off. Ms. Lee entered the office where Ms. Bird was working alone, murdered her, then committed suicide. I&#8217;m getting this from the emergency team that was here before you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. I&#8217;ll need to see the crime scene.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>
<p>LaShay led me out of his office to an elevator, then hit the button for the tenth floor. We walked out into a clinically-clean hallway. I heard a commotion. &#8220;FUCK YOU!&#8221; someone was shouting. &#8220;DAMN YOU TO HELL, YOU INKY TENEBROUS MOTHERFUCKER!&#8221; I stepped forward to open the door and investigate, but the Doctor held me back. </p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s Room 27A. We&#8217;re testing whether it&#8217;s better to light a candle or curse the darkness. The candle is in Room 27B.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have a lot of projects going on here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes. Over there is our insect unit. Can you catch more flies with honey or vinegar, can ants really move plants, that kind of thing. Our kitchen is to the right &#8211; the chefs were using it today, but it comes in handy all the time. Just don&#8217;t go in there if you can&#8217;t stand the heat. And down that corridor are our weather unit, our fire unit, and our water unit. And that&#8217;s just the tip of the iceberg &#8211; &#8221; He pointed to a large room with a spike of ice poking through the floor. We continued on. &#8220;And over there is our forge. There are so many proverbs about metal that we hired our own team of blacksmiths. It was going great until they unionized, but now they always strike when the iron is hot.&#8221;</p>
<p>The corridor opened into a vast auditorium. All around me, I saw knee-high marble buildings, gleaming palaces, and &#8211; was that the Colosseum? A man dressed in a gladiator costume was sitting behind a desk doubling as a terraced hill, frowning at a computer and occasionally typing something. &#8220;Our 1:100 scale model of Rome,&#8221; said LaShay. &#8220;We figured if we couldn&#8217;t build it in 0.24 hours or less, then Rome couldn&#8217;t be built in a day. For some reason I always get lost and end up here. It&#8217;s quite annoying.&#8221;</p>
<p>We passed out of Rome into another corridor, where we finally came to a door marked &#8220;Information Technology&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ms. Bird&#8217;s office,&#8221; said LaShay, and I walked in.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a homicide detective; I&#8217;m used to grisly murder scenes. This one still made me gasp. One victim &#8211; Ms. Bird, I supposed &#8211; was lying on the ground by the desk. It looked like her head had been bashed in by a blunt object. But there was more. Her mouth area was covered with blood, and I soon found her tongue had been cut out. And there was another bloody hole in her chest. The stomach and heart had been cut out too.</p>
<p>A few feet away, a second body dangled from a noose that had been tied to one of the rafters. Ms. Lee, I supposed. No mutilation on this one. Just a clean suicide, or at least that was what somebody had gone through a lot of trouble to make it look like.</p>
<p>Lying on the ground approximately between the two of them was a bloody knife. I knew from the previous report that the blood was Ms. Bird&#8217;s, and the fingerprints on the handle were Ms. Lee&#8217;s.</p>
<p>This did not seem like a Sherlock Holmes level mystery. Except: where were Bird&#8217;s heart and tongue?</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure,&#8221; said LaShay, when I went outside and asked him the question. &#8220;I&#8230;haven&#8217;t been in there since in happened. Not sure I could deal with the blood. One of Ms. Bird&#8217;s coworkers had a question about the network, so she went in and saw&#8230;what you just saw. We called 911 in case either of them was still alive. The paramedics called the police who did a preliminary investigation of the scene. And then you showed up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll need to search the premises,&#8221; I said. &#8220;What time did Bird come to work?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand she usually arrives around seven.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And when does the office open?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So potentially Lee could have had two hours to hide the heart and tongue somewhere in this building before going back and hanging herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why would she have done that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Do you have a better idea for what happened to them?&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good. Then I&#8217;ll need to search the whole building. Is there anywhere I&#8217;ll need any special keys or codes to enter?&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave me a golden key. &#8220;This opens any door,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But don&#8217;t go in the Red Zone. That&#8217;s off-limits to everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>I shrugged. &#8220;Then it&#8217;s exactly the sort of place somebody would hide something, isn&#8217;t it? Why isn&#8217;t anyone allowed in the Red Zone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Radioactivity,&#8221; he answered immediately. &#8220;We have a giant machine for testing all machine-related proverbs. It&#8217;s&#8230;very impressive. Powers the whole building, runs the water and gas systems, even gives us satellite internet. We wanted it to be just a generic Machine, capital m, so it does a little of everything. But it&#8217;s radioactive&#8230;not traditionally, the way you can detect with a Geiger counter. I don&#8217;t understand the physics. But people tend to get very sick if they get too close to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Part of LaShay&#8217;s description had stuck with me. &#8220;It provides the building with Internet? Lisa&#8217;s a sysadmin. Did she ever have to work with the Machine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, that was all connected when the Machine was installed. She interfaces with it remotely, through her computer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Catherine? Did her work with the animals ever bring her near the Machine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her office was very close to the Red Zone. Closer than any other office in the building, actually. But she never had any reason to enter the danger area.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to need to see the Machine. Is there any way I can do so safely?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have an observation deck. It&#8217;s just above the Machine, on this floor. You can stare down at the Machine from the top.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll need to go there.&#8221; It was just a hunch, but I wasn&#8217;t liking the sound of this Machine. And if you were going to hide body parts for some reason, why not hide them in a restricted area where nobody ever went?&#8221;</p>
<p>LaShay took me down a series of turns and hallways. After a minute or two of walking&#8230;we were in the scale model of Rome again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dammit!&#8221; said LaShay. &#8220;Every time!&#8221;</p>
<p>Another few turns and hallways, and we finally came to a steel-reinforced door. &#8220;DANGER&#8221; it said. &#8220;OBSERVATION AREA. CHILDREN AND PREGNANT WOMEN NOT ALLOWED. PLEASE DO NOT SPEND MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES IN THE OBSERVATION AREA OVER A ONE WEEK PERIOD.&#8221;</p>
<p>I used my golden key to unlock the door. We went in.</p>
<p>We were on iron scaffolding. Below us whirred something amazing. It was like every children&#8217;s-book description of a machine put together and brought to life, a huge assembly of gears and pistons and bubbling glowing bright-colored chemicals coursing through glass pipes. Beside me was a control panel, currently set at &#8220;NORMAL&#8221;. The other options ranged from &#8220;OFF&#8221; to &#8220;MAXIMUM&#8221; to &#8220;ULTRAMAXIMUM&#8221; to &#8220;SUPRAULTRAMAXIMUM&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s beautiful,&#8221; I told the Doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t touch that,&#8221; he told me, glancing nervously at the control panel.</p>
<p>The machine was nine stories high, filling the entire center of the laboratory. In the center, an enormous agglomeration of steampunk-looking gadgetry formed a hollow cylinder, spinning faster than I could follow. I leaned out over the edge of the scaffold, over the pit formed by the cylinder&#8217;s center.</p>
<p>&#8220;You really don&#8217;t want to do that,&#8221; LaShay told me. I could see what he meant. It was easy to imagine falling right through the hole in the spinning cylinder, down to the ground ten stories below. I had a strange feeling that gravity would be the least of my problems if that happened, that anything that went through that spinning apparatus would have a very bad time long before it hit the ground. And&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the spinning cylinder, incongruously, was a building I could only describe as a small shrine. It had a little golden dome on the top, and&#8230;actually, it was exactly a shrine. There was a Star of David atop the dome.</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said LaShay. His voice changed, became heavier. &#8220;I started this laboratory with my colleague, Dr. Rissum. He&#8230;he committed suicide nine years ago by jumping into the Machine from this very spot. That&#8217;s his memorial.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My God! You&#8217;re telling me there was another suicide in this lab?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nine years ago. The police investigated. There was nothing suspicious. His wife had just left him and taken the children. It was very tragic, but no foul play was suspected.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still. Another suicide.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to get out of here,&#8221; said LaShay. &#8220;Being this close to the Machine really isn&#8217;t good for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I looked around the observation deck and at the floor ten stories below. There were no signs of blood, a tongue, or a heart. &#8220;All right,&#8221; I said, because the Machine was starting make me nervous too.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of the morning searching the rest of the laboratory, free of LaShay&#8217;s discomfiting presence. It was an exhausting task, not least because I always ended up in the Rome model even when I thought I was in a totally different part of the building. But eventually I found two things that caught my interest.</p>
<p>First, Lisa Bird&#8217;s chair. I had gone back into the room with the bodies to look for other clues. The desk was normal enough. The computer was a normal Apple MacBook. But I noticed Lisa&#8217;s chair was made out of human hands. This was confusing enough that I called the Doctor back, who of course had an explanation.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re not real hands,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Most of the staff have chairs like that. We were testing whether many hands make light work, so we had everyone working for the lab sit on those.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty gruesome,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We originally tried putting those statues of the Buddhist god with the thousands of hands all around the office,&#8221; LaShay admitted. &#8220;But people complained that the hands were whispering demonic messages to them. Finally someone in the Religion Department reminded me that idol hands are the Devil&#8217;s plaything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; I said, and dismissed LaShay again, with some relief. He told me he would be working over the weekend, and said I could call him if anything came up. I hoped I wouldn&#8217;t have to. Something was weird about that guy, no doubt.</p>
<p>The second thing I found was Lisa Bird&#8217;s tongue and stomach. It was in the third drawer of Catherine Lee&#8217;s desk. The woman had murdered her coworker, cut out her tongue and stomach, put it in the third drawer of her desk, gone back up to the murder scene, and committed suicide.</p>
<p>Or, more accurately, this was a subset of what she had done, because I still couldn&#8217;t find Lisa&#8217;s heart. I searched Catherine&#8217;s desk inside and out. All I could find were a couple of paperweights made of various gemstones. I noticed they were about the right size and shape to have made the dent in Lisa Bird&#8217;s head, but none of them had any bloodstains on them or anything else suspicious. There were no severed organs.</p>
<p>I was missing something. But what?</p>
<p><b>II.</b></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the detective on the Bird case?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mmmrrrgyeah,&#8221; I answered groggily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to the station,&#8221; said Officer Karp. &#8220;The murderer&#8217;s body is missing.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was 8 AM on Saturday. I had visited the Proverb Laboratory Friday, told the station that the scene had been fully examined and they could take the bodies away, then gone home and slept. The station had sent a team to recover the bodies and bring them to the morgue. The next morning, one of the morgue staff had noticed that although Lisa Bird was still there, Lee&#8217;s body was missing.</p>
<p>Still only half-awake, I went to the morgue and examined the scene. The body bag was still in place. It had been expertly opened up and the body had been removed. There were no fingerprints. Karp was seething that a theft had been committed in the police station itself. He demanded we do something. I suggested we go to Catherine Lee&#8217;s house, interview her husband, see what he could tell us. That was how I ended up spending my Saturday morning at the weirdest house I had ever seen.</p>
<p>It was some kind of modernist experimental dwelling or something. The whole place was made out of windows. Not one-way windows either. You could see everything that happened in it. Not (I thought to myself) the sort of place a criminal would find very convenient.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was Cat&#8217;s idea,&#8221; her husband told us, when we knocked on the door and introduced ourselves. &#8220;She was always so paranoid that I was having an affair. Well, some weird architect made this house and then put it on the market &#8211; obviously nobody wanted it, so the price was right. Cat thought it was perfect. I couldn&#8217;t hide anything here. You&#8217;ve got to believe me, officers. I never had an affair with anybody. She was paranoid. But not violent. I know they say she killed that woman. But she would never do something like that. She was framed. I&#8217;m sure of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who would do such a thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She talked about office politics all the time. I know things I&#8217;m not supposed to know. The Proverb Laboratory, they talk about selling their work to corporations, but the US military is the big sponsor. A lot of their best work is hush-hush.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m aware,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she would tell me all these rumors. Apparently the British hate the Proverb Laboratory. Before LaShay and Rissum started it ten years ago, the British had a monopoly on English-language proverbs. You&#8217;d have all these proverbs about kings and queens and tea and castles. It was a way for them to maintain their cultural hegemony over us. That&#8217;s what Cat would say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was Catherine by any chance paranoid and delusional about British people?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She was paranoid and delusional about a lot of things, but I tell you, she wasn&#8217;t a killer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were there any specific British people? Or anyone else who didn&#8217;t like what the Proverb Laboratory was doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was the English Defense League. Have you ever heard of them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re some kind of white supremacist group, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must be thinking of the White Defense League. The English Defense League are an English supremacist group. As in, the English language. They believe English is superior to all other languages. They want to stop foreign language education in school, kick foreign speakers out of the country, make English the official national language, that kind of thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And they&#8217;re against the Proverb Laboratory?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Lee laughed. &#8220;Or else they <i>are</i> the Proverb Laboratory. You know LaShay used to be one of them? No, from the look on your face you didn&#8217;t. He was part of their cult for a while, then deconverted and went mainstream, spoke out against them for the press. But some people say that&#8217;s all a ruse, and he&#8217;s continuing their work. They always thought that with enough study, they could use create some kind of super-proverb that would encapsulate all wisdom and make them unstoppable, something like that. LaShay says he&#8217;s beyond all that, but who knows? And if he is, well, maybe the cult that he left isn&#8217;t so happy to have the US military meddling in their pet project?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so weird. I never heard about them before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Cat heard a lot of things, working at the Proverb Lab for five years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did she like it there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no. She hated it. She loves animals, you know. But the Proverb people thought they were just means to an end. She was in a big fight with LaShay just before she died. He wanted to test the proverb &#8216;Every dog has its day&#8217;. He was going to lock up forty, fifty dogs in a dark room, to simulate night, and just <i>leave</i> them there. Wanted to &#8220;falsify the hypothesis&#8221;. Cat said absolutely not, that was animal cruelty. So he did it anyway without telling her. She was enraged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did she ever make any threats? Say she was going to blow the whistle on the lab or anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, nothing like that. She said she was going to let sleeping dogs lie. Sorry. I don&#8217;t think she had any enemies. She could be paranoid, she could be strange, but she was a good person, deep down. She wouldn&#8217;t have done this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; Officer Karp interrupted.</p>
<p>He was pointing to a corner of the kitchen. At first I didn&#8217;t see it. Then I did. There was a little drop of blood on the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Lee, do we have your full permission to search this house?&#8221; I asked. Officer Karp was already calling the station, letting them know they were going to need to send out an evidence collection team.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Mr. Lee. &#8220;I have nothing to hide.&#8221;</p>
<p>Officer Karp went to the cabinet just next to the bloodstain, reached in, and pulled out a human heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8230;I swear I have no idea how that got there,&#8221; said Mr. Lee.</p>
<p>&#8220;How late did you sleep yesterday morning, when the murder happened?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8230;it was my day off. I slept until ten.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And your house is about a fifteen minute drive from the lab. So in theory, your wife could have killed Ms. Bird, left the Proverb Laboratory, come back home, hid the heart in your cupboard, then gone back to the Proverb Laboratory and hung herself, all before anyone else showed up for work at nine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&#8230;why would Cat have done that?&#8221; pled Mr. Lee.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Did she have any motive for disliking Ms. Bird other than the affair issue? Anything at all?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; said her husband. &#8220;She spoke very highly of Ms. Lee. Apparently her computer had a virus once, and Ms. Bird solved it. She&#8217;d gotten a degree in cybersecurity from MIT before ending up in this job, and she was always working hard to keep the servers safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One more question. Do you know who stole your wife&#8217;s body from the morgue?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; asked Mr. Lee. &#8220;Someone stole&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This guy&#8217;s as surprised as we are,&#8221; said Officer Karp. &#8220;I say he&#8217;s not a suspect.&#8221;</p>
<p>We drove back to the station in silence. Either Catherine Lee had murdered her coworker, driven home to hide her heart in a cabinet, and then gone back to work before killing herself &#8211; or somebody had put a lot of work into making it look that way. And somebody had stolen her body from the morgue. And there was some sort of web of international intrigue surrounding Doctor LaShay. </p>
<p>I decided I was going to go home, catch up on my sleep, and then think this over <i>really hard</i>.</p>
<p><b>III.</b></p>
<p>Sunday morning I walked back into the Proverb Laboratory. I was trying to get to Dr. LaShay&#8217;s office, but I had ended up in the scale model of Rome again. I hadn&#8217;t even taken an elevator, and it was on the tenth floor. That no longer confused me. I had finally figured out what I should have realized days earlier.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dammit!&#8221; said LaShay, almost bumping into me. &#8220;Rome again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor Zachary LaShay,&#8221; I said, &#8220;You are under arrest, for the murders of Ms. Lisa Bird and Catherine Lee. You have&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t arrest me!&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;the right to remain silent,&#8221; I continued. &#8220;Anything you say can and&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Two men in black uniforms and sunglasses stumbled into the Rome set just behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said LaShay. &#8220;I mean you can&#8217;t arrest me. The federal government has taken over the investigation, as of today. The entire affair has been classified as top secret. You&#8217;re not even allowed to be here anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>I sighed. &#8220;Then I&#8217;ll just take a moment to talk with one of these agents&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The agents didn&#8217;t move.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have one minute to get off this property,&#8221; said Dr. LaShay, &#8220;or you will be in violation of federal law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; I told the agents. &#8220;Listen up.&#8221; Then I explained everything.</p>
<p>The Proverb Laboratory didn&#8217;t exist to test proverbs at all. Or they did, but not in the way they claimed. The Proverb Laboratory existed to test the Machine. A device that makes proverbs real. The Machine exerted some kind of invisible force. The closer you got, the more the English language warped reality in order to make proverbs come true.</p>
<p>Why had Lisa Bird&#8217;s tongue and heart been missing? Because the proverb goes &#8220;Cat got your tongue&#8221;. The Machine&#8217;s power had forced Cat to take Lisa&#8217;s tongue and bring it somewhere that would qualify as her &#8220;having&#8221; it. And the same force had made her bring the heart home, because &#8220;Home is where the heart is&#8221;. She hadn&#8217;t meant to take the stomach too, but had removed it for better access, since &#8220;The way to a man&#8217;s heart is through his stomach&#8221;. Then her corpse, which had spent years absorbing the Machine&#8217;s malevolent radiation, had vanished from the body bag where it was kept &#8211; &#8220;Cat&#8217;s out of the bag&#8221;.</p>
<p>What had Catherine used to bash Lisa&#8217;s head in? The obvious candidate was one of the gemstone paperweights hidden in her desk, which she had brought back at the same time as she brought the tongue.  I hadn&#8217;t been able to find bloodstains on any of the paperweights, but that was unsurprising; &#8220;You can&#8217;t get blood from a stone&#8221;. She lived in a glass house, and had broken the rule about throwing stones, and so ended up dead and a murderer. The saying goes: &#8220;Kill two birds with one stone&#8221;. Catherine had killed Lisa Bird; where was the other? Simple. Lisa sat on a chair made of hands, and a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. She was worth two birds all on her own.</p>
<p>But it was too perfect. How had it all come together? A paranoid lady who thought everyone was having an affair with her husband. Who lived in a glass house and owned gemstone paperweights. Sharing a building with a woman named Bird. Who was sitting on a chair made of hands. In the closest office to the machine that made proverbs true. This wasn&#8217;t a coincidence. This was planned. Someone must have arranged for a paranoid woman who lived in a glass house to be on the spot, given her the stone paperweights as presents, placed Bird on the hand-chair, then relied on the Machine to twist reality into committing the crime for him. They must have guessed that after it was all over, Lee would recover her senses, feel terrible guilt, and kill herself. Who could have done that? LaShay was the only person powerful enough to make it all happen.</p>
<p>LaShay was lying about the memorial to Rissum. They hadn&#8217;t built a temple on the spot where Rissum died. That temple was Rissum himself. He had fallen into the very center of the Machine, where the reality-bending force approached infinity and proverbs would come true no matter how unlikely. &#8220;My body is a temple&#8221;. Rissum&#8217;s body was transformed into a temple in mid-air, then fell onto the ground below. Why would LaShay hide this? Could it be because he had pushed Rissum into the machine himself to seize complete control over the operation?</p>
<p>But why? The rumor Mr. Lee had told me tied everything together. Dr. LaShay was still with the English Defense League. They had designed the Machine. He had pretended to go mainstream, pretended to partner with Dr. Rissum, in order to get enough money and status to build their invention. Now he was slowly testing its capacities, secretly funneling the results to his secretive language-cult. Rissum had been a convenient co-founder, but had to go in order to give LaShay full control. He had pushed him into the Machine, disguised it as a suicide, and was funneling the information &#8211; how?</p>
<p>Through a worm in the computer system. After all, the workers here all had Apple computers, and every apple has its worm. But LaShay hadn&#8217;t realized that along with her sysadmin work, Lisa was an expert in cybersecurity, nor that she would come in two hours early every Friday. &#8220;The early Bird catches the worm.&#8221; Lisa had found the infection and destroyed it. She hadn&#8217;t realized it was important, but LaShay realized he couldn&#8217;t reinfect the system without her finding it again and getting suspicious, and he couldn&#8217;t fire her without raising eyebrows. So instead, he had arranged matters perfectly to guarantee she would get killed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow,&#8221; said Dr. LaShay after a second. &#8220;You&#8217;re actually right about everything. Except for one thing. The most important thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not real federal agents,&#8221; he said, gesturing at the men in black. &#8220;They&#8217;re with me.&#8221; He turned to them. &#8220;Throw him in the Machine.&#8221;</p>
<p>I reached for my gun, but the agents were faster than I was, wrestled it away from me. Then one of them held each of my arms and started dragging me to the observation deck. A slight delay as we ended up back in Rome. Then we were there, and I was standing over the great rotating cylinder, staring at the shrine of Dr. Rissum below.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t let me die,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I&#8217;m begging you. Please spare my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You really think we care about that?&#8221; asked the first agent.</p>
<p>They pushed me to the edge of the scaffold. </p>
<p>&#8220;You really think I was begging because I thought you&#8217;d listen?&#8221; I said, but before I finished he had thrown me over. There was a gust of wind and a feeling of terrible wrongness.</p>
<p>When I had fallen five stories, into the very center of the Machine, I <i>wished</i>.</p>
<p>A flying horse was somewhat outside the scope of the relevant proverb, but there was no other way I was going to &#8220;ride&#8221; while in midair, so I got one. It made landfall right on the observation scaffold, then rushed for the door. The two agents rushed after it. Somewhere in the corridor, the horse dissolved, its Machine-powered existence apparently expending itself this far from the source.</p>
<p>I ran frantically through the corridor. &#8220;After him, you fools!&#8221; I heard LaShay shout. I reached the point where I thought the elevator should be, but of course I was in fricking Rome again.</p>
<p>One of the agents ran in, reached for his gun.</p>
<p>I ducked behind the terraced hill. There beside the desk was the gladiator costume, complete with weapons. I picked up a trident. &#8220;<i>Ave Imperator!</i>&#8221; I said. &#8220;<i>Morituri te salutant!</i>&#8221; Like a miracle, it worked. The agent aimed at me and pulled the trigger, but the gun blew up in his face. This close to the Machine, he should have known: &#8220;When in Rome, do as the Romans do.&#8221;</p>
<p>The agent was still on his feet. I had made the mistake of getting far enough from the hill-desk that the agent could pick up the abandoned sword. He rushed at me. I didn&#8217;t know how to swordfight, so after a second of thought I took a pen out of my pocket, parried with it. The sword shattered, and ink squirted out into the agent&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>While he was trying to wipe off the ink and get his vision back, I ran out of Rome into one of the nearby corridors, then ducked into a randomly chosen door. Everything was pitch black. </p>
<p>&#8220;Come out, come out, wherever you are,&#8221; the agent shouted. &#8220;You can run, but you can&#8217;t hide!&#8221; Frick. I had forgotten that. In this place, the saying itself probably made that literally true. I heard the two agents opening and closing all the other doors in the corridor, getting inevitably closer to me.</p>
<p>Then I felt something cold and wet press against my hand. I almost screamed, giving away my location, but after a second it&#8230;licked me. I remembered what Mr. Lee had told me. Dr. LaShay had stuck fifty dogs in a completely dark room to test a proverb. I felt around. More and more dogs started to trot up to me, mouths panting, tails wagging. I had one chance.</p>
<p>I flung the door open as hard as I could &#8220;Run away, doggos!&#8221; I shouted. &#8220;Run like the wind! This is it! THIS IS YOUR DAY!&#8221;</p>
<p>The dogs didn&#8217;t need to be told twice. They rushed out of the room, a yapping growling barking mass of teeth and fur. Big dogs, little dogs, old dogs, young dogs, the whole mass of dogs ran right into the agents, knocked them over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Call off your dogs!&#8221; one of the agents shouted, but I didn&#8217;t. Instead, I cried &#8220;Havoc!&#8221;, and let loose the dogs of war. I figured their bark would be worse than their bite; on the other hand, once bitten, twice shy. It probably balanced out. Hopefully I wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about the agents for a few minutes.</p>
<p>I ran to where I thought the elevator would be, and <i>of fricking course</i> landed in Rome again. And worse, there was the Doctor, who was holding the trident I had abandoned. The sword was nowhere to be seen. I knew I wouldn&#8217;t be able to fool <i>him</i>. He had probably forgotten more proverbs than I had ever learned.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Ave Imperator!</i>,&#8221; said Dr. LaShay, approaching unarmed-me with his trident. &#8220;<i>Morituri te salutant.</i>&#8221; Even his <i>Latin</i> was better than mine. I wished I was first in a village. But hope beyond hope, I realized that the computer at the terraced-hill desk was an Apple. I grabbed it, pulled out the plug, brandished it before me. The Doctor staggered back, as if kept away by an invisible wall.</p>
<p>But it didn&#8217;t hold him for long. He stretched out his arm as far as it could go, lunged at the computer with the deadly trident. The screen shattered and went black, its power lost.</p>
<p>I ran through the maze of corridors, and LaShay followed, trident in hand. After several turns, I reached where I thought the elevator would be, but Rome was everywhere at once, and I had lost my bearings. I ended up in the Observation Room, standing on the iron scaffold above the machine, as LaShay and his trident came towards me.</p>
<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you figured out a way around being thrown into the Machine. &#8216;If wishes were horses, beggars would ride.&#8217; Clever. You could have been a great proverb researcher. But instead you had to meddle where you didn&#8217;t belong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you throw me into the pit, I&#8217;ll just get another flying horse,&#8221; I told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you will. So I&#8217;ll have to kill you with the trident.&#8221; I was backed up against the wall of the observation chamber. LaShay approached me confidently, knowing I was cornered.</p>
<p>&#8220;You really think you&#8217;re going to win this?&#8221; I asked. It wasn&#8217;t just to buy time. I really did have a plan, crazy as it was, but the more I could get him gloating, the better it would work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said LaShay. &#8220;I killed Bird and Lee, and now I&#8217;m going to kill you. Your death here will actually be quite convenient. I&#8217;ll announce that the Machine is too dangerous and needs to be taken apart. Then the version the English Defense League is building in secret will be the only one in the world. With the data we&#8217;ve gathered here, they&#8217;ll be able to direct its power anywhere on the planet. Imagine what we&#8217;ll be able to do. Enlist old soldiers who are impossible to kill. Build fortresses on demand by turning arbitrary Englishmen&#8217;s homes into castles. Control the seas using loose lips. Soon English-speakers will rule the world. And nothing &#8211; absolutely nothing &#8211; can stop us!&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Perfect.</i></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve forgotten three things,&#8221; I said. &#8220;First, that the lever is right here.&#8221;</p>
<p>I grabbed the lever on the control panel and jerked it to SUPRAULTRAMAXIMUM. The air started to shimmer, and the walls started to shake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Second, that pride cometh before a fall.&#8221;</p>
<p>The iron scaffolding started to tilt. LaShay stumbled, dropped his trident, almost tumbled over the edge, hung on just by the tips of his fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;And third, that <i>crime doesn&#8217;t pay!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>I grabbed the pointy end of the trident, and smashed it into LaShay&#8217;s fingers. With a scream, he fell into the belly of the Machine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ibegyounottodothis,&#8221; he said, and just like that he was on a winged horse. It flew up, towards the door and freedom.</p>
<p>I looked it in the mouth. I stared it straight in the mouth, looked as hard as I could, like my eyes were drilling into it. It started flickering, flying more slowly and hesitantly. &#8220;I beg, I beg, I beg,&#8221; said LaShay. We stood there like that for a few seconds, him trying to wish harder, me trying to look the gift horse in the mouth harder, until finally the horse vanished, and LaShay fell back into the machine.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg, I beg, I beg!&#8221; he said again, there appeared another horse, a horse of a different color. I looked it in the mouth again. It rose more slowly and hesitantly. But LaShay leaned forward, finally covered its mouth with his hand so I couldn&#8217;t see it. &#8220;Your looking has no power anymore!&#8221; LaShay said triumphantly, and I believed him, since it came straight from the horse&#8217;s mouth. The impediment removed, the horse shot upwards, right up to the ceiling of the chamber.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get off your high horse,&#8221; I said, and the horse vanished a second time. A third time LaShay fell into the Machine, a third time he begged, and a third time a horse appeared beneath him. Again I started looking it in the mouth. Again he covered it with his hand, this time guiding the horse more slowly, trying not to let it overshoot and become higher than I was.</p>
<p>With a whinny of victory, the horse&#8217;s hoof landed on solid scaffold. And that was when I struck the hoof with my trident.</p>
<p>For the want of a nail, the horseshoe was lost. For the want of a shoe, the horse was lost. For the want of a horse, LaShay lost his footing and tumbled back into the pit. He tried begging again, but it didn&#8217;t work; that wasn&#8217;t the proverb. For want of the horse, the rider had to be lost, for want of the rider, the battle, and finally the war and kingdom with it. He fell through the Machine, all the way down. By the time he hit the ground, he had turned into another temple, standing silently beside the temple of his co-founder.</p>
<p>I moved the lever to OFF. Then, avoiding the sound of barking and screaming &#8211; and only getting stuck in Rome twice &#8211; I finally made it back to the elevator and left the building.</p>
<p><b>IV.</b></p>
<p>My department was able to make contact with the real military. They completed their investigation, and chose to shut down the Proverb Laboratory and destroy the Machine. </p>
<p>The two agents were found to be cultists with the English Defense League. On questioning, they led the government to their headquarters. The second Machine, the one that threatened to take over the world, was also found and destroyed.</p>
<p>I asked the prosecutor&#8217;s office to submit a statement officially declaring that Catherine Lee was not responsible for Lisa Bird&#8217;s murder, based on a sort of complicated insanity defense where she had been compelled to act by the Machine&#8217;s influence. I don&#8217;t think the prosecutor really bought it, but I think he figured she was dead anyway, so what was the harm?</p>
<p>Catherine&#8217;s body was never found, which didn&#8217;t surprise me. She really had absorbed a lot of radiation, working for the Laboratory for five years, and &#8220;the cat is out of the bag&#8221;, while true, didn&#8217;t suffice to explain how she had disappeared or where she was. I only figured it out later, after the whole battle with LaShay.</p>
<p>This life hadn&#8217;t treated Cat too kindly. I hope things go better during her next eight.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><font size="1"><i>[Epistemic status: fiction]</i></font></p>
<p>Thanks for letting me put my story on your blog. Mainstream media is crap and no one would have believed me anyway.</p>
<p>This starts in September 2017. I was working for a small online ad startup. You know the ads on Facebook and Twitter? We tell companies how to get them the most clicks. This startup &#8211; I won&#8217;t tell you the name &#8211; was going to add deep learning, because investors will throw money at anything that uses the words &#8220;deep learning&#8221;. We train a network to predict how many upvotes something will get on Reddit. Then we ask it how many likes different ads would get. Then we use whatever ad would get the most likes. <A HREF="https://minimaxir.com/2017/06/reddit-deep-learning/">This guy</A> (who is not me) explains it better. Why Reddit? Because the upvotes and downvotes are simpler than all the different Facebook reacts, plus the subreddits allow demographic targeting, plus there&#8217;s <A HREF="https://www.reddit.com/r/bigquery/comments/3cej2b/17_billion_reddit_comments_loaded_on_bigquery/">an archive of 1.7 billion Reddit comments</A> you can download for training data. We trained a network to predict upvotes of Reddit posts based on their titles.</p>
<p>Any predictive network doubles as a generative network. If you teach a neural net to recognize dogs, you can run it in reverse to get dog pictures. If you train a network to predict Reddit upvotes, you can run it in reverse to generate titles it predicts will be highly upvoted. We tried this and it was pretty funny. I don&#8217;t remember the exact wording, but for /r/politics it was something like &#8220;Donald Trump is no longer the president. All transgender people are the president.&#8221; For r/technology it was about Elon Musk saving Net Neutrality. You can also generate titles that will get maximum downvotes, but this is boring: it will just say things that sound like spam about penis pills.</p>
<p>Reddit has a feature where you can sort posts by controversial. You can see the algorithm <A HREF="https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/lib/db/_sorts.pyx">here</A>, but tl;dr it multiplies magnitude of total votes (upvotes + downvotes) by balance (upvote:downvote ratio or vice versa, whichever is smaller) to highlight posts that provoke disagreement. Controversy sells, so we trained our network to predict this too. The project went to this new-ish Indian woman with a long name who went by Shiri, and she couldn&#8217;t get it to work, so our boss Brad sent me to help. Shiri had tested the network on the big 1.7 billion comment archive, and it had produced controversial-sounding hypothethical scenarios about US politics. So far so good.</p>
<p>The Japanese tested their bioweapons on Chinese prisoners. The Tuskegee Institute tested syphilis on African-Americans. We were either nicer or dumber than they were, because we tested Shiri&#8217;s Scissor on ourselves. We had a private internal subreddit where we discussed company business, because Brad wanted all of us to get familiar with the platform. Shiri&#8217;s problem was that she&#8217;d been testing the controversy-network on our subreddit, and it would just spit out vacuously true or vacuously false statements. No controversy, no room for disagreement. The statement we were looking at that day was about a design choice in our code. I won&#8217;t tell you the specifics, but imagine you took every bad and wrong decision decision in the world, hard-coded them in the ugliest possible way, and then handed it to the end user with a big middle finger. Shiri&#8217;s Scissor spit out, as maximally controversial, the statement that we should design our product that way. We&#8217;d spent ten minutes arguing about exactly where the bug was, when Shiri said something about how she didn&#8217;t understand why the program was generating obviously true statements.</p>
<p>Shiri&#8217;s English wasn&#8217;t great, so I thought this was a communication problem. I corrected her. The program was spitting out obviously false statements. She stuck to her guns. I still thought she was confused. I walked her through the meanings of the English words &#8220;true&#8221; and &#8220;false&#8221;. She looked offended. I tried to confirm. She thought this abysmal programming decision, this plan of combining every bad design technique together and making it impossible to ever fix, was the right way to build our codebase? She said it was. Worse, she was confused I <i>didn&#8217;t</i> think so. She thought this was more or less what we were already doing; it wasn&#8217;t. She thought that moving away from this would take a total rewrite and make the code much worse.</p>
<p>At this point I was doubting my sanity, so we went next door to Blake and David, who were senior coders in our company and usually voices of reason. They were talking about their own problem, but I interrupted them and gave them the Scissor statement. Blake gave the reasonable response &#8211; why are you bothering me with this stupid wrong garbage? But David had the same confusion Shiri did and started arguing that the idea made total sense. The four of us started fighting. I still was sure Shiri and David just misunderstood the question, even though David was a native English-speaker and the question was crystal-clear. Meanwhile David was feeling more and more condescended to, kept protesting he wasn&#8217;t misunderstanding anything, that Blake and I were just crappy programmers who couldn&#8217;t make the most basic architecture decisions. He kept insisting the same thing Shiri had, that the Scissor statement had already been the plan and any attempt to go in a different direction would screw everything up. It got so bad that we decided to go to Brad for clarification.</p>
<p>Brad was our founder. Don&#8217;t trust the newspapers &#8211; not every tech entrepreneur is a greedy antisocial philistine. But everyone in advertising is. Brad definitely was. He was an abrasive amoral son of a bitch. But he was good at charming investors, and he could code, which is more than some bosses. He looked pissed to have the whole coding team come into his office unannounced, but he heard us out.</p>
<p>David tried to explain the issue, but he misrepresented almost every part of it. I couldn&#8217;t believe he was lying just to look better to Brad. I cut him off. He told me not to interrupt him. Blake said if he wasn&#8217;t lying we wouldn&#8217;t have to interrupt to correct him, it degenerated from there. Somehow in the middle of all of this, Brad figured out what we were talking about and he cut us all off. &#8220;That&#8217;s the stupidest thing I ever heard.&#8221; He confirmed it wasn&#8217;t the original plan, it was contrary to the original plan, and it was contrary to every rule of good programming and good business. David and Shiri, who were bad losers, accused Blake and me of &#8220;poisoning&#8221; Brad. David said that of course Brad would side with us. Brad had liked us better from the beginning. We&#8217;d racked up cushy project after cushy project while he and Shiri had gotten the dregs. Brad told him he was a moron and should get back to work. He didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>This part of the story ends at 8 PM with Brad firing David and Shiri for a combination of gross incompetence, gross insubordination, and being terrible human beings. With him giving a long speech on how he&#8217;d taken a chance on hiring David and Shiri, even though he knew from the beginning that they were unqualified charity cases, and at every turn they&#8217;d repaid his kindness with laziness and sabotage. With him calling them a drain on the company and implied they might be working for our competitors. With them calling him an abusive boss, saying the whole company was a scam to trick vulnerable employees into working themselves ragged for Brad&#8217;s personal enrichment, and with them accusing us two &#8211; me and Blake &#8211; of being in on it with Brad.</p>
<p>That was 8 PM. We&#8217;d been standing in Brad&#8217;s office fighting for five hours. At 8:01, after David and Shiri had stormed out, we all looked at each other and thought &#8211; holy shit, the controversial filter works.</p>
<p>I want to repeat that. At no time in our five hours of arguing did this occur to us. We were too focused on the issue at hand, the Scissor statement itself. We didn&#8217;t have the perspective to step back and think about how all this controversy came from a statement designed to be maximally controversial. But at 8:01, when the argument was over and we had won, we stepped back and thought &#8211; holy shit.</p>
<p>We were too tired to think much about it that evening, but the next day we &#8211; Brad and the two remaining members of the coding team &#8211; had a meeting. We talked about what we had. Blake gave it its name: Shiri&#8217;s Scissor. In some dead language, scissor shares a root with schism. A scissor is a schism-er, a schism-creator. And that was what we had. We were going to pivot from online advertising to superweapons. We would call the Pentagon. Tell them we had a program that could make people hate each other. Was this ethical? We were in online ads; we would sell our grandmothers to Somali slavers if we thought it would get us clicks. That horse had left the barn a long time ago.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to just call up the Pentagon and tell them you have a superweapon. Even in Silicon Valley, they don&#8217;t believe you right away. But Brad called in favors from his friends, and about a week after David and Shiri got fired, we had a colonel from DARPA standing in the meeting room, asking what the hell we thought was so important.</p>
<p>Now we had a problem. We couldn&#8217;t show the Colonel the Scissor statement that had gotten Dave and Shiri fired. He wasn&#8217;t in our company; he wasn&#8217;t even in ad tech; it would seem boring to him. We didn&#8217;t want to generate a new Scissor statement for the Pentagon. Even Brad could figure out that having the US military descend into civil war would be bad for clicks. Finally we settled on a plan. We explained the concept of Reddit to the Colonel. And then we asked him which community he wanted us to tear apart as a demonstration.</p>
<p>He thought for a second, then said &#8220;Mozambique&#8221;.</p>
<p>We had underestimated the culture gap here. When we asked the Colonel to choose a community to be a Scissor victim, we were expecting &#8220;tabletop wargamers&#8221; or &#8220;My Little Pony fans&#8221;. But this was not how colonels at DARPA thought about the world. He said &#8220;Mozambique&#8221;. I started explaining to him that this wasn&#8217;t really how Reddit worked, it needed to be a group with its own subreddit. Brad interrupted me, said that Mozambique <A HREF="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mozambique/">had a subreddit</A>.</p>
<p>I could see the wheels turning in Brad&#8217;s eyes. One wheel was saying &#8220;this guy is already skeptical, if we look weak in front of him he&#8217;ll just write us off completely&#8221;. The other wheel was calculating how many clicks Mozambique produced. Mene mene tekel upharsin. &#8220;Yeah,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Their subreddit is fine. We can do Mozambique.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Colonel gave us his business card and left. Blake and I were stuck running Shiri&#8217;s Scissor on the Mozambique subreddit. I know, ethics, but like I said, online ads business, horse, barn door. The only decency we allowed ourselves was to choose the network&#8217;s tenth pick &#8211; we didn&#8217;t need to destroy everything, just give a demonstration. We got a statement accusing the Prime Minister of disrespecting Islam in a certain way &#8211; again, I won&#8217;t be specific. In the absence of any better method, we PMed the admins of the Mozambique subreddit asking them what they thought. I don&#8217;t remember what we said, something about being an American political science student learning about Mozambique culture, and could they ask some friends what would happen if the Prime Minister did that specific thing, and then report back to us?</p>
<p>We spent most of a week working on our project to undermine Mozambique. Then we got the news. David and Shiri were suing the company for unfair dismissal and racial discrimination. Brad and Blake and I were white. Shiri was an Indian woman, and David was Jewish. The case should have been laughed out of court &#8211; who ever heard of an anti-Semitic Silicon Valley startup? &#8211; except that all the documentation showed there was no reason to fire David and Shiri. Their work looked good on paper. They&#8217;d always gotten good performance reviews. The company was doing fine &#8211; it had even placed ads for more programmers a few weeks before.</p>
<p>David and Shiri knew why they&#8217;d been fired. But it didn&#8217;t matter to them. They were so blinded with hatred for our company, so caught in the grip of the Scissor statement, that they would tell any lie necessary to destroy it. We were caught in a bind. We couldn&#8217;t admit the existence of Shiri&#8217;s Scissor, because we were trying to sell it to the Pentagon as a secret weapon, and also, publicly admitting to trying to destroy Mozambique would have been bad PR. But the court was demanding records about what our company had been doing just before and just after the dismissal. A real defense contractor could probably have gotten the Pentagon to write a letter saying our research was classified. But the Pentagon still didn&#8217;t believe us. The Colonel was humoring us, nothing more. We were stuck.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how we would have dealt with the legal problems, because what actually happened was Brad went to David&#8217;s house and tried to beat him up. You&#8217;re going to think this was crazy, but you have to understand that David had always been annoying to work with, and that during the argument in Brad&#8217;s office he had crossed so many lines that, if ever there was a person who deserved physical violence, it was him. Suing the company was just the last straw. I&#8217;m not going to judge Brad&#8217;s actions after he&#8217;d spent months cleaning up after David&#8217;s messes, paying him good money, and then David betrayed him at the end. But anyhow, that was it for our company. Brad got arrested. There was nobody else to pay the bills and keep the lights on. Blake and I were coders and had no idea how to run the business side of things. We handed in our resignations &#8211; not literally, Brad was in jail &#8211; and that was the end of Name Withheld Online Ad Company, Inc.</p>
<p>We got off easy. That&#8217;s the takeaway I want to give here. We were unreasonably overwhelmingly lucky. If Shiri and I had started out by arguing about one of the US statements, we could have destroyed the country. If a giant like Google had developed Shiri&#8217;s Scissor, it would have destroyed Google. If the Scissor statement we generated hadn&#8217;t just been about a very specific piece of advertising software &#8211; if it had been about the tech industry in general, or business in general &#8211; we could have destroyed the economy.</p>
<p>As it was, we just destroyed our company and maybe a few of our closest competitors. If you look up internal publications from the online advertising industry around fall 2017, you will find some really weird stuff. <A HREF="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-jaffer-arrest-20171022-story.html">That story about</A> the online ads CEO getting arrested for murder, child abuse, attacking a cop, and three or four other things, and then later it was all found to be <A HREF="https://www.thewrap.com/tech-child-rape-vungle-zain-jaffer/">false accusations</A> related to some ill-explained mental disorder &#8211; that&#8217;s the tip of the iceberg. I don&#8217;t have a good explanation for exactly how the Scissor statement spread or why it didn&#8217;t spread further, but I bet if I looked into it too much, black helicopters would start hovering over my house.  And that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m going to say about that.</p>
<p>As for me, I quit the whole industry. I picked up a job in a more established company using ML for voice recognition, and tried not to think about it too much. I still got angry whenever I thought about the software design issue the Scissor had brought up. Once I saw someone who looked like Shiri at a cafe and I went over intending to give her a piece of my mind. It wasn&#8217;t her, so I didn&#8217;t end up in jail with Brad. I checked the news from Mozambique every so often, and it was quiet for a few months, <A HREF="https://mg.co.za/article/2018-06-22-00-mozambiques-mysterious-insurgency">and then it wasn&#8217;t</A>. I still don&#8217;t know if we had anything to do with that. Africa just has a lot of conflicts, and if you wait long enough, maybe something will happen. The colonel never tried to get in touch with me. I don&#8217;t think he ever took us seriously. Maybe he didn&#8217;t even check the news from Mozambique. Maybe he saw it and figured it was a coincidence. Maybe he tried calling our company, got a message saying the phone was out of service, and didn&#8217;t think it was worth pursuing. But as time went on and the conflict there didn&#8217;t get any worse, I hoped the Shiri&#8217;s Scissor part of my life was drawing to a close.</p>
<p>Then came the Kavanaugh hearings. Something about them gave me a sense of deja vu. The week of his testimony, I figured it out. </p>
<p>Shiri had told me that when she ran the Scissor on the site in general, she&#8217;d just gotten some appropriate controversial US politics scenarios. She had shown me two or three of them as examples. One of them had been very specifically about this situation. A Republican Supreme Court nominee accused of committing sexual assault as a teenager.</p>
<p>This made me freak out. Had somebody gotten hold of the Scissor and started using it on the US? Had that Pentagon colonel been paying more attention than he let on? But why would the Pentagon be trying to divide America? Had some enemy stolen it? I get the <i>New York Times</i>, obviously Putin was my first thought here. But how would Putin get Shiri&#8217;s Scissor? Was I remembering wrong? I couldn&#8217;t get it out of my head. I hadn&#8217;t kept the list Shiri had given me, but I had enough of the Scissor codebase to rebuild the program over a few sleepless nights. Then I bought a big blob of compute from Amazon Web Services and threw it at the Reddit comment archive. It took three days and a five-digit sum of money, but I rebuilt the list Shiri must have had. Kavanaugh was in there, just as I remembered.</p>
<p><i>But so was Colin Kaepernick</i>.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve heard of him. He was the football player who refused to stand for the national anthem. If I already knew the Scissor predicted one controversy, why was I so shocked to learn it predicted another? Because Kaepernick started kneeling in 2016. We didn&#8217;t build the Scissor until 2017. Putin hadn&#8217;t gotten it from us. Someone had beaten us to it.</p>
<p>Of the Scissor&#8217;s predicted top hundred most controversial statements, Kavanaugh was #58 and Kaepernick was #42. #86 was the Ground Zero Mosque. #89 was that baker who wouldn&#8217;t make a cake for a gay wedding. The match isn&#8217;t perfect, but #99 vaguely looked like the Elian Gonzalez case from 2000. That&#8217;s five out of a hundred. Is that what would happen by chance? It&#8217;s a big country, and lots of things happen here, and if a Scissor statement came up in the normal course of events it would get magnified to the national stage. But some of these were too specific. If it was coincidence, I would expect many more near matches than perfect matches. I found only two. The pattern of Scissor statements looked more like someone had arranged them to be perfect fits.</p>
<p>The earliest perfect fit was the Ground Zero Mosque in 2009. Could Putin have had a Scissor-like program in 2009? I say no way. This will sound weird to you if you&#8217;re not in the industry. Why couldn&#8217;t a national government have been eight years ahead of an online advertising company? All I can say is: machine learning moves faster than that. Russia couldn&#8217;t hide a machine learning program that put it eight years ahead of the US. Even the Pentagon couldn&#8217;t hide a program that put it eight years ahead of industry. The NSA is thirty years ahead of industry in cryptography and everyone knows it.</p>
<p>But then who was generating Scissor statements in 2009? I have no idea. And you know what? I can&#8217;t bring myself to care.</p>
<p>If you just read a Scissor statement off a list, it&#8217;s harmless. It just seems like a trivially true or trivially false thing. It doesn&#8217;t activate until you start discussing it with somebody. At first you just think they&#8217;re an imbecile. Then they call you an imbecile, and you want to defend yourself. Crescit eundo. You notice all the little ways they&#8217;re lying to you and themselves and their audience every time they open their mouth to defend their imbecilic opinion. Then you notice how all the lies are connected, that in order to keep getting the little things like the Scissor statement wrong, they have to drag in everything else. Eventually even that doesn&#8217;t work, they&#8217;ve just got to make everybody hate you so that nobody will even listen to your argument no matter how obviously true it is. Finally, they don&#8217;t care about the Scissor statement anymore. They&#8217;ve just dug themselves so deep basing their whole existence around hating you and wanting you to fail that they can&#8217;t walk it back. You&#8217;ve got to prove them wrong, not because you care about the Scissor statement either, but because otherwise they&#8217;ll do anything to poison people against you, make it impossible for them to even understand the argument for why you deserve to exist. You know this is true. Your mind becomes a constant loop of arguments you can use to defend yourself, and rehearsals of arguments for why their attacks are cruel and unfair, and the one burning question: how can you thwart them? How can you convince people not to listen to them, before they find those people and exploit their biases and turn them against you? How can you combat the superficial arguments they&#8217;re deploying, before otherwise good people get convinced, so convinced their mind will be made up and they can never be unconvinced again? <i>How can you keep yourself safe?</i></p>
<p>Shiri read two or three sample Scissor statements to me. She didn&#8217;t say if she agreed with them or not. I didn&#8217;t tell her if I agreed with them or not. They were harmless.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t hear voices in a crazy way. But sometimes I talk to myself. Sometimes I do both halves of the conversation. Sometimes I imagine one of them is a different person. I had a tough breakup a year ago. Sometimes the other voice in my head is my ex-girlfriend&#8217;s voice. I know how she thinks and I always know what she would say about everything. So sometimes I hold conversations with her, even though she isn&#8217;t there, and we&#8217;ve barely talked since the breakup. I don&#8217;t know if this is weird. If it is, I&#8217;m weird.</p>
<p>And that was enough. For some reason, it was the third-highest-ranked Scissor statement that did it. None of the others, just that one.  The totally hypothetical conversation with the version of my ex-girlfriend in my head about the third Scissor statement got me. Shiri&#8217;s Scissor was never really about other people anyway. Other people are just the trigger &#8211; and I use that word deliberately, in the trigger warning sense. Once you&#8217;re triggered, you never need to talk to anyone else again. Just the knowledge that those people are out there is enough.</p>
<p>I thought I&#8217;d be done with this story in a night. Instead it&#8217;s taken me two weeks, all the way up until Halloween &#8211; perfect night for a ghost story, right? I&#8217;ve been alternately drinking and smoking weed, trying to calm myself down enough to think about anything other than the third Scissor statement. No, that&#8217;s not right, definitely trying not to think about either of the first two Scissor statements, because if I think about them, I might start thinking about how some people disagree with them, and then I&#8217;m gone. Three times I&#8217;ve started to call my ex-girlfriend to ask her where she is, and if I ever go through with it and she answers me, I don&#8217;t know what I will do to her. But it isn&#8217;t just her. Fifty percent of the population disagrees with me on the third-highest-ranked Scissor statement. I don&#8217;t know who they are. I haven&#8217;t really appreciated that fact. Not really. I can&#8217;t imagine it being anyone I know. They&#8217;re too decent. But I can&#8217;t be sure it isn&#8217;t. So I drink.</p>
<p>I know I should be talking about how we all need to unite against whatever shadowy manipulators keep throwing Scissor statements at us. I want to talk about how we need to cultivate radical compassion and charity as the only defense against such abominations. I want to give an Obamaesque speech about how the ties that bring us together are stronger than the forces tearing us apart. But I can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Remember what we did to Mozambique? How out of some vestigial sense of ethics, we released a low-potency Scissor statement? Arranged to give them a bad time without destroying the whole country all at once? That&#8217;s what our shadowy manipulators are doing to us. Low-potency statements. Enough to get us enraged. Not enough to start Armageddon.</p>
<p>But I read the whole list. And then, like an idiot, I thought about it. I thought about the third-highest-ranked Scissor statement in enough detail to let it trigger. To even begin to question whether it might be true is so sick, so perverse, so hateful and disgusting, that Idi Amin would flush with shame to even contemplate it. And if the Scissor&#8217;s right then half of you would be gung ho in support.</p>
<p>You guys, who haven&#8217;t heard a really bad Scissor statement yet and don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like &#8211; it&#8217;s easy for you to say &#8220;don&#8217;t let it manipulate you&#8221; or &#8220;we need a hard and fast policy of not letting ourselves fight over Scissor statements&#8221;. But how do you know you&#8217;re not in the wrong? How do you know there&#8217;s not an issue out there where, if you knew it, you would agree it would be better to just nuke the world and let us start over again from the sewer mutants, rather than let the sort of people who would support it continue to pollute the world with their presence? How do you know that you&#8217;re not like the schoolkid who superciliously says &#8220;<i>Nothing</i> is bad enough to deserve a swear word&#8221; when the worst that&#8217;s ever happened to her is dropping her lollipop in the dirt. If that schoolkid gets kidnapped and tortured, does she change her mind? If she can&#8217;t describe the torture to her schoolmates, but just says &#8220;a really bad thing happened to me&#8221;, and they still insist nothing could be bad enough to justify using swear words, who do you side with? Then why are you still thinking I&#8217;m &#8220;damaged&#8221; when I tell you I&#8217;ve seen the Scissor statement, and charity and compassion and unity can fuck off and die?  Some last remnant of <A HREF="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/30/book-review-inadequate-equilibria/">outside-view morality</A> keeps me from writing the whole list here and letting you all exterminate yourselves. Some remnant of how I would have thought about these things a month ago holds me back. So listen:</p>
<p>Delete Facebook. Delete Twitter. Throw away your cell phone. Unsubscribe from the newspaper. Tell your friends and relatives not to discuss politics or society. If they slip up, break off all contact.</p>
<p>Then, buy canned food. Stockpile water. Learn to shoot a gun. If you can afford a bunker, get a bunker.</p>
<p>Because one day, whoever keeps feeding us Scissor statements is going to release one of the bad ones.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you first take the Artifact, you will see a vision of ALPHANION, Demon-Sultan of the Domain of Order, who appears as a grid of spheres connected by luminous lines. Alphanion will urge you to use the Artifact to enforce cosmic order, law at its most fundamental. He will show you visions of all the most brutal and sadistic crimes of history, of all the wars caused by nations that could not live together in harmony, and he will tell you they are all preventable. He will show you dreams of perfectly clean cities with wide open streets, where everyone earns exactly the optimal amount of money and public transportation is accurate to the second. He will tell you it is all attainable.</p>
<p>But if you hesitate even an instant to take Alphanion’s offer, you will see a vision of CTHGHFZXAY, Demon-Shah of the Domain of Chaos, who appears as a shifting multicolored cloud. Cthghfzxay will urge you to use the Artifact to promote cosmic chaos, the ultimate principle of freedom. She will condemn the works of Order as a lie, a dystopia bought at the cost of true human liberty. She will show you visions of primaeval forests, where no two flowers are alike, where each glade holds a new mystery, where people run wild in search of new adventure. She will tell you it can all be yours.</p>
<p>As you weigh these two offers, you will see a vision of ZAMABAMAZ, Demon-Pharaoh of the Domain of Balance, who appears as a man and woman conjoined. They will tell you that neither Order nor Chaos is at the root of human flourishing, but an ability to strike the right balance between the two. That a virtuous life is one spent in moderation between total wild liberty and a stifling concept of rote rule-following. That Alphanion and Cthfhfzxay are the two poles of the universe, and that righteousness exists in the space created by their interaction. They will ask you to devote the Artifact and its power to the Domain of Balance, so all people can better manage the interaction of Order and Chaos in their own lives.</p>
<p>This will seem reasonable to you, but then there will appear a vision of IYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY, Demon-Raja of the Domain of Excess, who appears as a blinding violet light. It will tell you that both Order and Chaos present coherent visions of the world, but that for the love of God, choose one or the other instead of being a wishy-washy milquetoast who refuses to commit to anything. It will tell you that blinding white and pitch black are both purer and more compelling than endless pointless grey. It will ask you to give the Artifact to somebody &#8211; anybody &#8211; other than Zamabamaz.</p>
<p>Just as you think you have figured all this out, there will appear a vision of MLOXO7W, Demon-Kaiser of the Domain of Meta-Balance, who appears as a face twisted into a Moebius strip. It will tell you that sometimes it is right to seek balance, and other times right to seek excess, and that a life well-lived consists of excess when excess is needed, and balance when balance is needed. It will remind you that sometimes you are a sprinter and other times a tightrope walker in the Olympiad of life, and that to commit to either eternal carefulness or eternal zealousness is to needlessly impoverish yourself. It will ask you to devote the Artifact and its power to balancing balance and imbalance, balancedly.</p>
<p>You will not be the least bit surprised when there will appear a vision of K!!!111ELEVEN, Demon-Shogun of the Domain of Meta-Excess, who appears as a Toricelli trumpet with eyes and a mouth. She says that seriously, pick a side, all this complicated garbage about the balance between balance and excess is just another layer of intellectualization to defend against having any real values, a trick to make you feel smart and superior for believing in nothing, not even Balance. She will ask you to choose something now, lest you be caught in an endless regress of further options.</p>
<p>As soon as you acknowledge that this makes sense, there will appear a vision of ILO, Demon-Chancellor of the Domain of Excessive Meta-Balance, who appears as a deep hole in space whose end you cannot see. They will point out that yes, there is potentially an infinite regress of further levels. But to act to avoid those levels is essentially to unthinkingly side with the principle of Excess over Balance. After all, if you had originally started by siding with Chaos or Order rather than waiting to hear of the existence of Balance, you would have been unknowingly favoring Excess over Balance. And if you had decided to choose either Excess or Balance, you would have been favoring the principle of Meta-Excess over Meta-Balance before even knowing they existed. So choosing at any level of the hierarchy is essentially equivalent to choosing Excess at all higher levels of the hierarchy. When viewed this way, the hierarchy collapses to chaos, order, first-level-balance, second-level-balance, third-level-balance, and so on. They offer a new, better vision: Infinite Balance, a theoretical top of the hierarchy in which you choose to balance all previous levels.</p>
<p>But as you start to consider this, there will appear a vision of PAHANUP, Demon-Taoiseach of the Domain of Balanced Meta-Balance, who appears as a hole in space exactly three inches deep. Ze will tell you that going to infinite lengths to ensure perfect balance at an infinite number of levels actually seems a bit excessive in ways. To choose either Chaos or Order outright would be insufficiently careful, but to give yourself an intractable problem with an endless number of meta-levels would be excessively careful. Ze will suggest seeking balance in the number of levels you seek balance in.</p>
<p>This will seem plausible to you right up until the sudden appearance of a fiery vision of IFNI, Demon-Secretary-General of the Domain of Chaotic Meta-Excess, who appears as static. She will point out that there is now another infinite regress, more difficult than the last &#8211; to wit, how long you should spend calculating the number of levels on which to seek balance. She will state her case thus: suppose you want to calculate the correct amount of balance in the universe. Let us call this Calculation A. You need to calculate how long to spend on this calculation before giving up and satisficing; let us call this Calculation B. But you need to calculate how long to spend on Calculation B before giving up and satisficing; let us call this Calculation C. Clearly you will never be able to complete any of the calculations. Therefore in order to avoid spending your entire life in an infinite regress of calculation, you should flip a coin right now and use it to decide either Chaos or Order, no takebacks.</p>
<p>But as you reach for the coin, you will see a vision of GOSAGUL, Demon-Admiral of the Domain of Ordered Meta-Balanced Excess, who appears as a cube with constantly flashing black and white faces. He will lecture you on how it seems pretty strange that, when faced with the most important decision in the history of the universe, you decide to flip a coin. Surely, even if Ifni&#8217;s argument is correct, you can do better than that! For example, you can just go a specific finite number of levels, such as three, then seek balance at that many levels, then stop. This will be strictly better than Ifni&#8217;s plan of choosing completely randomly.</p>
<p>But this sage advice is interrupted by MEGAHAHA, Demon-Pope of the Domain of Excessively Ordered Meta-Balance, who appear a as pattern of black and white that cycles between a line, square, cube, and hypercube. It will point out that if you&#8217;re in the business of accepting arguments along the lines that &#8220;it seems pretty strange that when faced with the most important decision in the history of the universe you&#8230;&#8221;, then it seems pretty strange that when faced with the most important decision in the history of the universe, you agree to a kind of random number of levels chosen by a demon you have no reason to trust. By what logic do you reject making the decision itself randomly, but accept making the decision about how many levels to make the decision on randomly? Any amount of Balance in Meta-Balancing Excess is just arbitrary capriciousness; you either need to act fully randomly, or embrace the entire difficulty of the problem.</p>
<p>At this point, you will remember that the Artifact is cursed and demons are evil. With a final effort of will, you will shout the words &#8220;I choose Balance! Just normal Balance! First-level Balance! That&#8217;s it!&#8221; and throw the Artifact to the ground, where it will shatter into a thousand pieces and the voices of the demonic hierarchy will suddenly all go silent.</p>
<p>And for a thousand years to come, heroes will grumble &#8220;Why, exactly, are we seeking balance in the universe? Isn&#8217;t that kind of dumb? Don&#8217;t we want more good stuff, and less bad stuff? Doesn&#8217;t really seem that balance is really what we&#8217;re after, exactly.&#8221;</p>
<p>And you will tell them the story of how once you found the Artifact that gave you mastery of the universe, and you refused to take more than about three minutes figuring out what to use it for, because that would have been annoying.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>[Few people realize that the 1997 cult hit GATTACA was actually just the first film in a three-movie trilogy. The final two movies, directed by the legendary Moira LeQuivalence, were flops which only stayed in theaters a few weeks and have since become almost impossible to find. In the interest of making them available to the general public, I&#8217;ve written summaries of some key scenes below. Thanks to user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/8n3xcy/evidence_for_transgenerational_epigenetic/dzsrw5c/">Begferdeth</a> from the subreddit for the idea.]</i></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>GATTACA II: EPI-GATTACA</b></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Congratulations, Vincent&#8221;, said the supervisor, eyes never looking up from his clipboard. &#8220;You passed them all. The orbital mechanics test. The flight simulator. All the fitness tests. More than passed. Some of the highest scores we&#8217;ve ever seen, frankly. You&#8217;re going to be an astronaut.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vincent&#8217;s heart leapt in his chest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pending, of course, the results of the final test. But this will be easy. I&#8217;m sure a fine specimen like you will have no trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The&#8230;the final test, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you know how things are. We want to make sure we get only the healthiest, most on-point individuals for our program. We used to do genetic testing, make sure that people&#8217;s DNA was pre-selected for success. But after the incident with the Gattaca Corporation and that movie they made about the whole thing, public opinion just wasn&#8217;t on board, and Congress nixed the whole enterprise. Things were really touch-and-go for a while, but then we came up with a suitably non-invasive replacement. Epigenetics!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Epi&#8230;genetics?&#8221; asked Vincent. He hoped he wasn&#8217;t sounding too implausibly naive &#8211; he had, after all, just aced a whole battery of science tests. But surely there were some brilliant astronomers who didn&#8217;t know anything about biology. He would pretend to be one of those.</p>
<p>The supervisor raised an eyebrow, but he went on. &#8220;Yes, epigenetics. According to studies, stressful experiences &#8211; anything from starvation to social marginalization &#8211; change the methylation pattern of your genes. And not just your genes. Some people say that these methylation patterns can transfer to your children, and your children&#8217;s children, and so on, setting them back in life before they&#8217;re even born. Of course, it would be illegal for us to take a sample and check your methylation directly &#8211; but who needs that! In this day and age, everybody&#8217;s left a trail online. We can just check your ancestors&#8217; life experiences directly, and come up with a projection of your methylation profile good enough to predict everything from whether you&#8217;ll have a heart attack to whether you&#8217;ll choke under pressure at a crucial moment. I&#8217;ll just need to see your genealogy, so we can run it through this computer here&#8230;you did bring it like we asked you, right? Of course you did! A superior individual like you, probably no major family traumas going back five, six generations &#8211; I bet you&#8217;ve got it all ready for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vincent reached into his briefcase, took out a slim blue binder. <i>Here goes nothing,</i> he thought.</p>
<hr />
<p>Two weeks earlier, he had thrown a wad of cash down on a granite table in a downtown apartment.</p>
<p>The man across from him leaned forward in his wheelchair, extended a trembling arm to slowly take the cash.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re, uh, sure you want to do this?&#8221; asked Vincent, suddenly feeling a pang of conscience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; rasped Jerome. &#8220;You&#8217;re young. You still have your whole life ahead of you. You can still make something of yourself. Me, I&#8217;m done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; said Vincent, despite his better judgment, &#8220;just because you&#8217;re partly paralyzed doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t&#8230;do anything, really. Write a book. Travel the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to know how this happened?&#8221; Jerome asked. &#8220;I did it to myself. I used to be the best swimmer in the state, maybe in the country. I was going to the Olympics. With a spotless family history like mine, there were no limits. Then it happened. I had a fluke defeat. Lost the Olympics qualifier by a hairbreadth to a guy I&#8217;d beaten twenty times before. After that, why go on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&#8230;couldn&#8217;t you have just tried again four years later?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You still don&#8217;t get it. It wasn&#8217;t the loss. That loss <i>stressed me out</i>, Vincent. It made me <i>feel bad about myself</i>. I experienced <i>lowering of my social status</i>. With my methylation profile that screwed, it wasn&#8217;t just my own body I had ruined. It was my future children too. How was I ever going to marry when I would have to look my wife in the eyes and tell her our kids would be epigenetically tainted forever? So I did the only thing I could. I threw myself in front of a car. Couldn&#8217;t even kill myself properly, that&#8217;s what happens when your methylation profile is ruined. So here I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry,&#8221; said Vincent, who was starting to regret ever having come. &#8220;We can help you. We can find some way to&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jerome, and he put the cash in his pocket. &#8220;What&#8217;s done is done.&#8221; He took a slim blue binder, slid it over the table to Vincent. &#8220;My geneaology. Absolutely perfect. Not a single microaggression against any of my ancestors since the Mayflower.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vincent considered saying something, but finally just nodded. &#8220;I won&#8217;t let you down. I&#8217;ll use the gift you&#8217;ve given me in a way that would make you proud.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p>He&#8217;d been so close. And now, this&#8230;whatever it was.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a problem with <i>you</i>,&#8221; said the supervisor, though he looked haggard and did not exactly inspire confidence. &#8220;It&#8217;s just&#8230;there&#8217;s been an incident. We&#8217;re interviewing everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was two days before launch. Everything had been set up. Now, as the supervisor ushered him into a sterile-looking interview room, he could already imagine the headlines. MAN BUYS FALSIFIED GENEAOLOGY, TRIES TO HIDE EPIGENETIC INFERIORITY. Or, FRAUD DECEIVES EPIGATTACA CORPORATION, MISSION CALLED OFF.</p>
<p>He was so busy generating worst-case scenarios that he didn&#8217;t even notice the identity of the detective seated across from him until the door had closed and they were alone together.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Anton?&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Vincent?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>&#8220;Um&#8230;yeah&#8230;&#8221; was the best Vincent could think of to say to his older brother.</p>
<p>They&#8217;d been in touch, sure. But Vincent had thought it prudent not to mention his exact job description, lest his brother start asking the wrong questions. He&#8217;d just said he worked for the Epigattaca corporation, letting Anton infer that he was sweeping floors or validating parking tickets or something else suitable to someone with his inadequate histone pattern. Finally he put himself together and spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been a death. One of the executives. Foul play suspected. I&#8217;m a detective, so&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Then it had nothing to do with him. Or, at least, it hadn&#8217;t. Now&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, Anton. Before you ask, yeah. I admit it. I faked my epigenome. There&#8217;s a black market in geneaologies. I found a guy willing to sell his identity. I saved up, bought it from him, gave it to the suits here. They think I haven&#8217;t had a microaggression in my family line since the Mayflower. And they&#8217;re going to do it. They&#8217;re going to let me go to space.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why, Vincent? You were always such a good kid!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of <i>course</i> you wouldn&#8217;t understand,&#8221; said Vincent.</p>
<p>It was true. Anton was five years older. He&#8217;d been born perfect, the product of the latest eu-epigenics program. Female infants with good epigenes were sent to live a sheltered existence in Denmark, the most equitable country in the world, and kept drugged on heroic doses of beta-blockers to prevent them from feeling any trauma or anxiety. They were raised in special houses by caretakers who denied them nothing, then sent to special schools where it was impossible to fail or feel inadequate. Then, when they reached puberty, they were artificially fertilized &#8211; no <i>way</i> the program was going to let them deal with something as stressful as sexual relationships &#8211; until they pumped out five or ten kids each. The most innocent were brought back to the shelters to restart the cycle.</p>
<p>It had all gone so well with Anton. But a year after he was born, everything had changed. One of the nurses had gotten sick, and an untrained nurse was brought in to cover. She had told Anton&#8217;s mother that she was looking &#8220;a little chubby&#8221;. Faced with this sudden awareness of patriarchal beauty standards and devaluing from a human being to a sex object, her histones had wilted instantly, her precious DNA inundated with methyl groups. When the scientists found out, they discharged her from the breeding program, she married a similarly damaged man, and the result, a few years later, had been Vincent.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; said Anton. &#8220;I can never understand what you go through. But I&#8217;m going to clear you. Right now. No conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vincent could barely believe he&#8217;d heard correctly. &#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&#8230;my son. Your nephew. I never told you this, but a few years ago, he broke his leg biking. We got it treated by a black-market doctor, covered it up, no trace of it in any of the records, but &#8211; I can&#8217;t help worry about him. He remembers what happened. He&#8217;s going to need role models to look up to when he grows older, people who overcame epigenetic determinism and succeeded despite the changes our experiences impose on our DNA. He&#8217;s going to need someone like you. And besides, we&#8217;re brothers. I&#8217;ve already figured out who committed the murder &#8211; it was another executive whose department would profit by delaying the launch. I&#8217;m going to report that you&#8217;re innocent. And I&#8217;m also going to report that I didn&#8217;t discover anything else of note about you. Nothing that should delay this week&#8217;s launch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8230;you&#8217;d really do that for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good luck in space, bro.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vincent walked out of the office in a daze. By the time he reached his desk, the email was already on the screen &#8220;Detective has said you&#8217;re good to go &#8211; launch is still on for Wednesday&#8221;. He read it three times, lost in thought.</p>
<p>He had always wanted to be an astronaut. Now he realized why &#8211; it was to escape his own epigenome. More than that &#8211; it was to escape a world that held epigenetics in such high regard that his epigenome mattered. He would still go to space. He would do it for Anton&#8217;s son, and for all the other individuals with a history of personal or family trauma. But he no longer felt like there was nothing for him on Earth. There were people who would judge him as a full human being, not just a methylation pattern shaped by familial disadvantage. And someday &#8211; he vowed &#8211; <a href="http://www.wiringthebrain.com/2018/05/grandmas-trauma-critical-appraisal-of.html?m=1">everyone would be able</a> <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/science-and-health/.premium-doubts-arising-about-claimed-epigenetics-of-holocaust-trauma-1.5466710">to say the same</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>GATTACA III: EDU-GATTACA</b></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Congratulations, Vincent&#8221;, said the supervisor, eyes never looking up from his clipboard. &#8220;You passed them all. The astrogation test. The crisis simulation. All the physicals and health panels. More than passed. Some of the highest scores we&#8217;ve ever seen, frankly. You&#8217;re going to be an astronaut&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Vincent broke out into a giant smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;pending, of course, the results of the final test. But this will be easy. I&#8217;m sure a fine specimen like you will have no trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The&#8230;the final test, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you know how things are. We want to make sure we get only the strongest, most intelligent individuals for our program. We used to do genetic testing, make sure that people&#8217;s DNA was pre-selected for success. But after the incident with the Gattaca Corporation and that movie they made about the whole thing, public opinion just wasn&#8217;t on board, and Congress nixed the whole enterprise. Then we tried epigenetics, but it turned out they made a movie about that one too. Really, our luck in all of this has been terrible. But this time, we&#8217;ve really got it! This time, we know how to identify truly superior human beings who deserve to be astronauts, no creepy biology involved. We&#8217;re going to base our decision on&#8230;what institution you spent four years in during your teens and early twenties!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>come on</i>,&#8221; said Vincent. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you just give up already and judge people on their merit?&#8221;</p>
<p>The supervisor pounded the desk. &#8220;Never! So-called meritocracy is a sham <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/07/24/targeting-meritocracy/">designed to justify inequality</a>. No, we&#8217;ve made our choice, and we&#8217;re going to judge you by which university accepted you at age 17 based on a combination of illegibly-inflated grades, recommendations by people who barely knew you, and how much money your parents were willing to donate. You can complain all you want, but that&#8217;s just how we roll, here at the&#8230;&#8221; He pointed out the window, to the gleaming sign outside &#8220;&#8230;at the PhDMSMABSBA corporation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you even expect people to pronounce that?&#8221; asked Vincent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Irrelevant! Now tell us what college you went to, so we can figure out what Greek letter to assign you on your application.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Greek letter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just an internal company code we use. We got tired of saying &#8216;top-tier institution&#8217;, &#8216;second-tier institution&#8217;, and so on, so now you&#8217;re Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons. The Alphas get positions like executive or astronaut. The Betas get positions in middle management. The Gammas and Deltas have jobs like clerks and call center reps. And the Epsilons do the really dirty work, the stuff nobody else will touch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s terrible!&#8221; said Vincent.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what <i>everybody</i> does,&#8221; the supervisor corrected. &#8220;The only difference is we use Greek letters. Is your moral system so fragile that its results depend on whether you refer to something with Greek letters or not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow,&#8221; said Vincent, &#8220;this conversation has taken a disturbing turn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. So why don&#8217;t you just show us your college degree, and we can get your application going?&#8221;</p>
<p>Vincent reached into his briefcase, took out a slim red binder. <i>Here goes nothing,</i> he thought.</p>
<hr />
<p>Two weeks earlier, he had thrown a wad of cash down on a marble table in a suburban apartment.</p>
<p>The man across from him leaned forward in his wheelchair, extended a trembling arm to slowly take the cash.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re, uh, sure you want to do this?&#8221; asked Vincent, suddenly feeling a pang of conscience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; rasped Jerome. &#8220;You&#8217;re young. You still have your whole life ahead of you. You can still make something of yourself. Me, I&#8217;m done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; said Vincent, despite his better judgment, &#8220;just because you&#8217;ve got some kind of condition doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t&#8230;do anything, really. Write a book. Travel the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to know how this happened?&#8221; Jerome asked. &#8220;I did it to myself. I used to be the best football player in the state. Maybe the country. Got accepted to Harvard on a football scholarship. Then I learned that college football causes so many concussions that it increases your risk of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. I didn&#8217;t know what to do. Stick around, and I risked degenerating into the condition you see me in now. Leave, and I&#8217;d lose my scholarship, never get a degree, and have to go to community college. I&#8217;d never be anything higher than a Delta.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A Delta?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some new corporate jargon people are using.&#8221; Jerome shrugged. &#8220;So I kept it up and got my degree. Now I can barely walk, and half the time I can&#8217;t remember my own name. So here I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry,&#8221; said Vincent, who was starting to regret ever having come. &#8220;We can help you. We can find some way to&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jerome, and he put the cash in his pocket. &#8220;What&#8217;s done is done.&#8221; He took a slim red binder, slid it over the table to Vincent. &#8220;My Harvard degree. Top-tier institution, absolutely Alpha quality. With this, every single door in the world will be open to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vincent considered saying something, but finally just nodded. &#8220;I won&#8217;t let you down. I&#8217;ll use the gift you&#8217;ve given me in a way that would make you proud.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was two days before launch. Everything had been set up. Now, as the supervisor ushered him into a sterile-looking interview room, he could already imagine the headlines. MAN BUYS FAKE DEGREE, TRIES TO HIDE EDUCATIONAL INFERIORITY. Or, FRAUD DECEIVES PHDMSMABSBA CORPORATION, MISSION CALLED OFF.</p>
<p>He was so busy generating worst-case scenarios that he didn&#8217;t even notice the identity of the detective seated across from him until the door had closed and they were alone together.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Anton?&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Vincent?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>&#8220;Um&#8230;yeah&#8230;&#8221; was the best Vincent could think of to say to his younger brother.</p>
<p>They&#8217;d been in touch, sure. But Vincent had thought it prudent not to mention his exact job description, lest his brother start asking the wrong questions. He&#8217;d just said he worked for the PhDMSMABSBA corporation, letting Anton infer that he was sweeping floors or validating parking tickets or something else suitable to someone with his educational background. Finally he put himself together and spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been a death. One of the executives. Foul play suspected. I&#8217;m a detective, so&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Then it had nothing to do with him. Or, at least, it hadn&#8217;t. Now&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, Anton. Before you ask, yeah. I admit it. I faked my degree. I found a guy willing to sell his identity. I saved up, bought it from him, gave it to the suits here. They think I&#8217;m a Harvard alum. And they&#8217;re going to do it. They&#8217;re going to let me go to space.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why, Vincent? You were always such a good kid!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of <i>course</i> you wouldn&#8217;t understand,&#8221; said Vincent.</p>
<p>It was true. Vincent had spent years working ten-hour days after school teaching the saxophone to underprivileged children to build his resume, but the Admissions Departments hadn&#8217;t been impressed. Anton had learned from his mistake, hired an admissions coach, and with her guidance had founded the country&#8217;s first Klingon-language suicide prevention hotline; the Ivy League had eaten it up. Vincent had ended up with a degree from a Gamma-level state institution; Anton had gone to Yale.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; said Anton. &#8220;I can never understand what you go through. But I&#8217;m going to clear you. Right now. No conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vincent could barely believe he&#8217;d heard correctly. &#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&#8230;my son. Your nephew. You remember how he started a synchronized underwater molecular gastronomy team at his high school? Apparently all the other kids have been going to the Third World and starting synchronized underwater molecular gastronomy teams <i>there</i>, and we never knew about it. Now there&#8217;s no way he&#8217;s going to be competitive. I can&#8217;t help worry about him. He&#8217;s going to need role models to look up to when he grows older, people who overcame going to a low-tier college and succeeded anyway. He&#8217;s going to need someone like you. And besides, we&#8217;re brothers. I&#8217;ve already figured out who committed the murder &#8211; it was another executive whose department would profit by delaying the launch. I&#8217;m going to report that you&#8217;re innocent. And I&#8217;m also going to report that I didn&#8217;t discover anything else of note about you. Nothing that should delay this week&#8217;s launch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8230;you&#8217;d really do that for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good luck in space, bro.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vincent walked out of the office in a daze. By the time he reached his desk, the email was already on the screen &#8220;Detective has said you&#8217;re good to go &#8211; launch is still on for Wednesday&#8221;. He read it three times, lost in thought.</p>
<p>He had always wanted to be an astronaut. Now he realized why &#8211; it was to escape his own low-tier college degree. More than that &#8211; it was to escape a world that held degrees in such high regard that the college he went to mattered. He would still go to space. He would do it for Anton&#8217;s son, and for all the other individuals with a subpar secondary education. But he no longer felt like there was nothing for him on Earth. There were people who would judge him as a full human being, not just a set of letters after his name. And someday &#8211; he vowed &#8211; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Case-against-Education-System-Waste/dp/0691174652/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1529392760&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=case+against+education&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=slatestarcode-20&amp;linkId=fbe4e6a70b75502726d013f61e867f37">everyone would be able to say the same</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><i>[Taken from <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/02/some-puzzles-for-libertarians-2">here</a>.]</i></span></p>
<p><b>I.</b></p>
<blockquote><p>Deep in the forest, thousands of miles from civilization, there is an isolated village. It has not seen contact with any other humans for a long time. It is, however, a pleasant and flourishing community, which strongly values freedom and entrepreneurship. There is, however, one tiny quirk. In this village, there is a ritual. Every year, a boy who reaches 18 is cannibalized. It brings the rains, or something. But despite its taste for cannibalism, this village wishes to live in accordance with libertarian principles. Thus, they will only cannibalize the boy if he consents. In order to encourage this to happen, they will put tremendous social pressure on the boy. All through his youth, they will tell him they believe the future of the village depends on his consenting. His parents tell him that he would bring great shame on the household if he refused, which is true. The choice nevertheless rests with the boy, and whatever he chooses will be respected. The parents and villagers attempt to persuade him, but never lie to him, and make clear that they would never force his choice. However: if the boy refuses to be cannibalized, the village has a backup plan. The boy will be blacklisted. No shopkeeper will sell him food, no hotel will give him a room, no hospital will treat him, no employer will hire him. After all, under libertarian principles, nobody can be told how to use their property. The boy’s parents, ashamed of him, will turn him out of the house with no money. He may leave the village, but it is certain death, for thousands of miles of desolate wolf-infested wilderness stand between him and other humans and he has no food. (The wilderness is also privately-owned, and he cannot pay the admission fee.) He is shunned and despised, left to wander the streets in a futile search for shelter and sustenance. However, no force is exercised against him. He is never touched or arrested. He is treated as nonexistent, as the villagers await his demise. So the boy starves to death. The villagers then cannibalize his emaciated corpse, reasoning that they cannot be compelled to give him a dignified burial (plus he died on private property, collapsing in a flowerbed).</p>
<p>Is eating the boy’s corpse after he dies the only potential violation of libertarian principles in the village? Is every single other aspect of this completely permissible?</p></blockquote>
<p>The setting sun shone its last few rays on Independence Hall. The delegates were tired, but a thrill of excitement filled the air. The wrangling and deal-making was almost done; nothing remained but a few technicalities.</p>
<p>As the last sunbeam went below the horizon, something stirred in the middle of the chamber. It grew into a wind, then a whirlwind, and then standing among the assembled Founding Fathers was a strange man dressed all in silver, wearing a pair of gold goggles.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to stop!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;It&#8217;s all lies!&#8221;</p>
<p>George Washington had stayed calm through cavalry charges, artillery fire, and the assembled might of the United Kingdom. He flinched only a little here. &#8220;Who are you, sir? Where have you come from?</p>
<p>The traveler barely heard. &#8220;Listen! You think &#8216;democracy&#8217; can solve all your problems. But &#8211; imagine there&#8217;s a village full of cannibals. They have a tradition of picking a child, and killing and eating him when he&#8217;s eighteen years old. Well, even if that village is a democracy, then 51% of the population can just vote to kill and eat him! Do you want a <i>child</i> to be <i>killed and eaten</i>? Because that&#8217;s what your &#8216;democracy&#8217; inevitably leads to! Checkmate, liberals!&#8221;</p>
<p>The delegates were only less dazed by the man&#8217;s speech than by his sudden appearance. Finally, General Washington asked whether anyone wanted the floor. After a scramble of shouts and raised hands, the chair recognized James Madison, delegate from Virginia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said James Madison. &#8220;Our Traveler may not know this, but I am preparing a Bill of Rights to be added on to the end of this Constitution, severely limiting the powers which the government may exercise. I&#8217;m planning one on cruel and unusual punishment, which sounds like it ought to cover killing and eating someone, and there will also be various restrictions on seizure of persons. The Traveler is already wrong that we operate entirely on the basis of 51% of the populace &#8211; rather, there will be representatives, senators, and Supreme Court Justices. But even if all these people should agree to kill and eat someone, I am confident that the natural rights included in my bill will restrict such practices.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;AHA!&#8221; said the Traveler. &#8220;You&#8217;ve fallen for my trap! Because even if the government is banned from assisting in killing and eating someone, it could still happen. Imagine a system where, if the victim refused to be killed and eaten, then everyone in the village refused to house him, or feed him, so that he starved to death. Then he&#8217;d be dead anyway, and your precious Bill of Rights wouldn&#8217;t be able to do anything about it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t the victim just move to a different village?&#8221; interjected John Jay.</p>
<p>&#8220;The village is in the middle of a giant forest stretching five thousands miles, teeming with dire wolves,&#8221; snarled the Traveler, annoyed at such a stupid objection.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t the victim just build his own house, and farm his own food?&#8221; asked John Adams.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dire wolves would tear up the house, and trample all over the farm!&#8221; said the traveler. &#8220;You&#8217;re splitting hairs here! Why won&#8217;t anyone answer my question in the spirit it was intended?!&#8221;</p>
<p>There were more shouts and another frenzy for attention. General Washington banged his gavel. &#8220;The chair recognizes Alexander Hamilton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yo,&#8221; said Hamilton. &#8220;The institutions of our Constitution, give a clear solution to this persecution. The Revolution&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The chair unrecognizes Representative Hamilton, and offers the floor to anyone who does not speak in rap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Benjamin Franklin. &#8220;My good Mysterious Traveler, perhaps you labor under the misapprehension that political philosophies are also moral philosophies, and so fail irredeemably if they ever recommend an immoral course of action. I do not believe democracy is always right. But I believe it is a wise way to govern. All that systems of government can do is take nations &#8211; with all of their conflicts, ideas, prejudices, and values &#8211; as input, and then magnify some impulses and suppress others. Start with a country where every single person is entirely set on doing as much evil as possible, and democracy alone cannot save it; they will simply vote to do as much evil as possible. But start with a country in which there are many different classes, agendas, and visions, and I believe that a democratic system is more likely to magnify those impulses that help the common people, and suppress those impulses that lead to tyranny, than any other system yet devised.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re saying,&#8221; said the traveler, &#8220;that you <i>don&#8217;t care</i> that your precious democracy and even your so-called Bill of Rights aren&#8217;t good enough to save the life of a child in &#8211; &#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You listen here,&#8221; said Benjamin Franklin. &#8220;I care plenty. In a village that didn&#8217;t have any form of government, as soon as anybody big and strong enough wants to eat you, they can form a mob and drag you away. In a village that operates as a direct democracy, it&#8217;s harder. You need 51% of the population to want to eat you before you end up as dinner. And in a village that subscribes to Mr. Madison&#8217;s notion of natural rights, it&#8217;s harder still. You have to have every single person in the village agree not to feed the victim, without a single kindly old lady leaving food out on her porch at night when it&#8217;s too dark out for anyone to see. We have gone from tyranny &#8211; a system where, as long as even one person wishes you ill, you perish &#8211; all the way to a system where as long as there is a single person who does not wish you ill, you endure. That seems to me to be the best we can do in this world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly the Traveler seemed to warp, or crackle, like a signal from far away was being disrupted. &#8220;I must go!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m being recalled to my home time!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Where I will tell people that they should form a government based on socialism, and that it will be great, and nothing can possibly go wrong!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; said Jay. &#8220;You must tell us about this &#8216;socialism&#8217; of yours!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, before you&#8217;re lost to me, at very high velocity, what is this new philosophy, that can prevent atrocity?&#8221; begged Hamilton.</p>
<p>But it was Washington, ever the man of action, who jumped up from the chair and grabbed the Traveler by his silver arm, holding him against the winds of Time. &#8220;This &#8216;socialism&#8217; of yours &#8211; &#8221; asked Washington. &#8220;It can ensure that &#8211; even in a barbaric society where literally one hundred percent of the people are wholeheartedly dedicated to do so &#8211; nobody ever eats their fellow citizens?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; said the traveler. &#8220;Why, in <i>true</i> socialist countries, nobody ever eats anything at all!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he broke free of Washington&#8217;s grasp and disappeared forever, just as the first rays of the moon cast their white light on Philadelphia.</p>
<p><b>II.</b></p>
<blockquote><p>Is there a meaningful difference between coercion by the state and coercion by private entities?</p></blockquote>
<p>The door caved in loudly and suddenly, like a thunderclap. My Golden Retriever ran up, tail wagging, to investigate. Another loud noise, and my dog lay dead, bleeding on the floor in front of me.</p>
<p>“PUT YOUR HANDS UP!” said a man in black body armor and a black helmet. There were five of them, all with guns. My five-year-old son started to cry. “HANDS UP!” he shouted, “I’M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU AGAIN!”</p>
<p>I put my hands up. My son, who was screaming, got the presence of mind to put his hands up also, though not before one of the armored men had put a gun to his head.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?!” I asked. “Why are you doing this to us?”</p>
<p>One of the men put a gun to my head. “Admit it! You’re growing marijuana here!”</p>
<p>“I’m not!” I insisted.</p>
<p>“Is this 2051 Willow Street?”</p>
<p>“No, this is 2052 Willow Street. 2051 Willow Street is on the other side!”</p>
<p>“Oh. Well, sorry.”</p>
<p>“Sorry? That’s all you have to say? You killed my dog! You terrorized my five-year-old son!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, sorry. We’re McDonalds employees, and corporate headquarters must have given us bad directions.”</p>
<p>“You’re…McDonalds employees? Why are McDonalds employees doing no-knock raids in body armor looking for marijuana?”</p>
<p>“I&#8230;I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Then why are you even here? You just think it&#8217;s <i>okay</i> to randomly go around, kill people&#8217;s pets, terrorize their families, when you don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;re doing it? How can you justify such a thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard there were a bunch of people who were okay with private coercion, and only objected to coercion when it was applied by the State.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>What?</i> Where did you hear that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Some socialist magazine, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>III.</b></p>
<blockquote><p>Can you construct a theory of property rights that does not suffer from internal incoherence or depend on specious natural law assumptions?</p></blockquote>
<p>Professor Kryzenski sat down in her desk and booted up her computer. It was another quiet morning here at the Harvard Philosophy Department. She had won her position as Department Chair by discovering a complete theory of morality grounded in first principles with no internal incoherence or any specious assumptions, able to determine everything from the optimal number of minutes to spend speaking to your mother each week to <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/17/newtonian-ethics/">how close you could come to beggars before you were obligated to give them money</a>.</p>
<p>She had just finished checking her emails &#8211; mostly invitations to speak at various conferences and events &#8211; when something started to stir in the center of her office. It turned into a wind, then a whirlwind, and finally, a strange-looking man, dressed in silver with gold goggles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Professor!&#8221; said the Traveler. &#8220;Professor Kryzenski! Terrible news!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Professor, whose mind had plumbed the depths of ontology and ascended the heights of metaphysics, was a hard woman to perturb. &#8220;Yes?&#8221; she asked the man. &#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose there&#8217;s an evildoer who punishes all evildoers who do not punish themselves. Does the evildoer punish himself, or not?&#8221;</p>
<p>Professor Kryzenski realized the implications right away. &#8220;My God. It&#8217;s a paradox! My complete theory of morality grounded in first principles with no internal incoherence or specious assumptions, able to determine everything from the right amount to tip your waiter to the exact words you need to speak before a sexual act for it to qualify as consensual &#8211; lies in ruins!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that means&#8230;&#8221; began the Traveler.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Professor Kryzenski. She and the Traveler spoke in unison: <i>&#8220;Nothing is true and everything is permissible.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve prepared for this day.&#8221; She took a key out of a potted plant on the windowsill, then used it to open a locked cupboard in her desk. Inside were two hatchets. She handed one to the Traveler.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are we going?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;To the daycare down the road, to hack the limbs off the babies,&#8221; she said. &#8220;<i>Obviously</i>.&#8221; The Traveler nodded his approval, and off they went, eyes red with bloodlust.</p>
<p><b>IV.</b></p>
<blockquote><p>The Infinitely Rich Man is not infinitely rich. He is just very, very rich. Nobody knows quite how rich. One day, you happened to meet the Infinitely Rich Man in a bar. At first he was friendly, but soon you found yourselves in an argument about horses. You were for them, and he was against them. Or perhaps you were against them, and he was for them. You don’t actually remember how it went. As you parted ways, you expected never to see the Infinitely Rich Man again.</p>
<p>Little do you know: the Infinitely Rich Man now despises you. His sole desire on earth is to see you unhappy. This should hardly trouble you, though. After all, you have a good job at a castanet factory. You own your own home, which has a picturesque lake view. You have a wife, whom you love and who loves you. You also have a prized possession, your 1972 Pontiac Lemans. You don’t have much spare cash, but this never bothers you because of your stable job. The Infinitely Rich Man is also a strict Libertarian. He believes it is illegitimate for anyone to initiate force against another. And because you are fortunate enough to live in a Libertarian world, you are free to enjoy those things you treasure most in the world without being bothered by the state or the Infinitely Rich Man. The Infinitely Rich Man is not discouraged, however. He still believes he can ruin you. He will be a Count of Monte Cristo, but an extremely law-abiding one.</p>
<p>The first thing the Infinitely Rich Man does is buy the castanet factory where you work. He immediately fires you. He also makes sure that if any other employers inquire about you, the castanet factory will refuse to serve as a reference. Not that this matters, for he intends to bribe any other castanet company who hires you into firing you. (There are four castanet companies.) You therefore find yourself unemployed. Fortunately, you have a skill. You know how to make castanets! (Castanets are very popular.) So you scrape together what money you have, and you open a little drive-thru castanet stand out on Route 9. But the Infinitely Rich Man has a plan. He opens a stand next to yours. At his stand, castanets are free. He gives them away by the truckload. He sets the whole world clacking. You cannot compete. You are ruined.</p>
<p>At least you still have your wife, your friends, your lakeview home, your 1972 Pontiac Lemans. But the Infinitely Rich Man has a plan. First, he buys the lake. He fills it with concrete. No more lake view, and your property value diminishes by $100,000. Then, he buys every house around yours, flattens it, and turns it into a landfill. The smell doesn’t reach your home, but it turns the neighborhood unsightly and desolate. Your house becomes worthless. The Infinitely Rich Man buys the heating company and refuses to provide gas to your home at any price. (You try to talk other gas companies into competing, but they refuse; laying a new main for a single home would be absurd, they say.) But you have a wife! And friends! And you get to drive a 1972 Pontiac Lemans! The Infinitely Rich Man offers a bribe. Any of your friends who refuse to speak with you ever again will receive a salary of one million dollars per year. At first, many decline to take the bribe. But sooner or later, most of them have one or another sticky financial situation, and they give in. Goodbye, vast majority of your friends! At least your wife loves you.</p>
<p>But one day, she becomes ill. She finds out that she will die, unless she goes on a treatment regimen for the rest of her life. The regimen costs $100,000 a month. The Infinitely Rich man pops up, and offers to pay. The one condition is that she divorce you, cut contact, and never speak with you again. As soon as she breaks the agreement, he will cease to pay for the treatment. You love your wife, but you do not want her to die. You both agree that it is better that she should accept. At least you can drive your 1972 Pontiac Lemans. Oh, but wait. The Infinitely Rich Man invests heavily in electric energy. Slowly, he makes gasoline-powered transit obsolete. He buys the oil companies, burns the gasoline, and converts every gas pump to a charging station. You can only drive your Lemans short distances, using some of the last gallons of available petrol, which you ordered from the internet. (That is, if the Infinitely Rich Man didn’t outbid you!) They don’t make the Pontiac Lemans anymore. Parts therefore exist only in small quantities. The Infinitely Rich Man buys up all existing Lemans parts. The moment it breaks, you are out of luck. As you sit alone, broke, and starving in the garage of your unheated home, caressing your disabled Lemans, thinking about your long-gone wife, your lake view, and your job, you are thankful that you live in a world of freedom, where nobody can encroach upon the liberty of another.</p>
<p>Questions for Libertarians: Has the non-aggression principle been violated? Should the Infinitely Rich Man suffer any civil or criminal penalties for his actions?</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Mr. Thaddeus Nett-Worth III, Esq., &#8220;is the most benightedly offensive statement I have ever heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All I said,&#8221; I said, &#8220;was that horses were basically elongated cows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are a noble animal, an unparalleled paragon of mammalian perfection!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Like cows are. Only more elongated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dastard!&#8221; said Mr. Nett-Worth, pounding the table so hard his top hat and monocle almost fell off. &#8220;You&#8217;ve messed with the wrong captain of industry, believe you me. Let me tell you what I am going to do. You own a castanet factory? I am going to undercut you, undercut you <i>bad</i>. I will destroy your business. Then, I shall buy the lake by your home and fill it up with concrete. I will buy your heating company and refuse to sell you gas. I will bribe your friends never to speak to you again. I will wait until your wife develops a deadly disease, then offer to treat her if only she divorces you. I can do all of it, because we are in a perfectly libertarian society with no laws besides the non-aggression principle, where lawmakers have failed to pass commonsense legislation like &#8216;making it illegal to hurt someone by legal means&#8217;. And then &#8211; alone, friendless, shivering in the cold in your hopelessly ugly house &#8211; then you will <i>rue</i> the day you ever compared horses to &#8211; &#8221; (he almost spits) &#8221; &#8211; elongated cows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, I mean, think about it. Their faces are a little bit longer. Their bodies are a little bit longer. They&#8217;re pretty much just elongated cows. I&#8217;m sorry this is so hard for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What? You&#8217;re not backing down? You should be at my feet, begging me for forgiveness! Don&#8217;t you know all the things I can use my wealth to do to you in our perfectly libertarian society?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, well, about that. I know this guy named David Friedman, whose hobby is designing <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/18/book-review-the-machinery-of-freedom/">weird insurance systems for anarcho-capitalist utopias</a> based on, like, <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/13/book-review-legal-systems-very-different-from-ours/">the laws of medieval Iceland</a> or something. Anyway, he sells &#8216;rich person gets a weird grudge against you&#8217; insurance. I have loads of it. However much you try to bribe my friends not to talk to me, his company will pay more to bribe them to ignore you. However much you try to pay for my gas company, his company will pay more to keep my heat on. And if you try to offer my wife free health care to leave me, his company will offer her better health care to stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What? How did you even know to buy such an insurance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, part of it was just a &#8216;why not?&#8217; sort of thing. The odds of the situation ever happening are so astronomically low that the insurance was incredibly cheap &#8211; a few cents per year. Also, the mere existence of the insurance prevents rich people from starting bizarre revenge schemes against the people in it, so they can afford to assume they will rarely have to pay out. I guess the price was so low that it was a no-brainer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what about transaction costs? Why would you even think to look into such a product?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this is going to sound weird, but &#8211; I was reading a history book a few months ago, and &#8211; you remember that time a time traveler appeared in the middle of the Constitutional Convention, making some kind of point about how democracy wouldn&#8217;t work in a village of evil cannibals? Don&#8217;t you think that was pretty weird?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had thought it was just one of the many colorful, larger-than-life stories from the Revolution. Like how George Washington was unimpeachably honest, or Benjamin Franklin always had a witty saying ready, or how Alexander Hamilton always spoke in rap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I used to think that too. But then I was reading a political science book last month, and &#8211; well, isn&#8217;t it weird that we&#8217;re a perfectly libertarian society? All of the old political philosophers used to say that libertarianism was an ideal system that could only be approached, never reached, and that even the approach would take a dedicated and virtuous population to pull it off. And our population isn&#8217;t that virtuous &#8211; I mean, just the other day I heard on the news about an ethics professor who went on a violent rampage chopping the limbs off babies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; said Mr. Nett-Worth. &#8220;I heard about that too. Terrible stuff, terrible!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it really only clicked a few weeks ago, when these goons from McDonalds broke into my house on a no-knock drug raid and shot my dog, and then muttered something about how surely I couldn&#8217;t object to <i>private</i> coercion. And it just got me thinking &#8211; <i>what if this whole world is just a thought experiment by a communist with a crappy understanding of political philosophy trying to <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/12/weak-men-are-superweapons/">weak-man</a> libertarianism?</i> And then I thought &#8211; frick, I better get some really good vengeful-rich-person insurance, like, right away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so confused right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, most sources define libertarianism as a political philosophy emphasizing individual autonomy and skeptical of government intervention. Libertarians come to their position for a wide variety of reasons, including belief that <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/">bottom-up local knowledge makes better decisions</a> than top-down absolutism, or that government intervention naturally favors the powerful, or that if you actually ask poor people what they want, it&#8217;s <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/08/a-something-sort-of-like-left-libertarianism-ist-manifesto/">usually more money</a>, not people <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/21/contra-robinson-on-public-food/">taking choices away from them</a> and treating them like children. A fraction of libertarians &#8211; I think a small fraction, though I can&#8217;t prove it &#8211; are also believers in a deontological theory of natural rights which emphasizes non-aggression as the fundamental moral principle. If you&#8217;re doing shoddy journalism aimed at inflaming people rather than enlightening them, you might try to tar all libertarians by identifying them with this subset.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How does that explain all the weird things going on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take the cannibal village. If for some reason you believe the Non-Aggression principle perfectly defines the moral outcome in every situation, it must be pretty devastating to learn it can lead to cannibalism. But if you&#8217;re a normal libertarian who just thinks of libertarianism as a political position, then it&#8217;s no worse than a supporter of representative democracy learning that representative democracy could sometimes lead to cannibalism &#8211; which of course it can. In fact, you should be happy to point out that a libertarian village is much more resistant to cannibalism than a direct democratic or monarchical one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about the ethics professor&#8217;s rampage?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If for some reason you insisted property rights were based on perfect axiomatized natural law, it might be pretty devastating to learn that moral philosophy can&#8217;t get that kind of precision. But you&#8217;re a normal libertarian who just thinks of libertarianism as a political position, then learning that you can&#8217;t perfectly axiomatize property rights is no more devastating than learning that you can&#8217;t perfectly axiomatize caring about the poor, or thinking torture is bad, or not hacking off babies&#8217; limbs. You&#8217;re still allowed to care about these things <a href="http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Property/Property.html">for the usual reasons</a> even if you can&#8217;t construct a perfect moral theory around them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what about the goons from McDonald&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If for some reason you believe that only the government can do anything bad, and private companies&#8230;look, I don&#8217;t even want to speculate on who exactly they&#8217;re trying to straw man here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not straw man. Weak man. There are some real libertarians who believe only the non-aggression principle matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe, some of them. I think in general they believe there are moral values other than non-aggression &#8211; after all, many of them are Christian, and believe in all sorts of moral values &#8211; but they&#8217;re skeptical of the government enforcing them. Remember, <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/28/contra-askell-on-moral-offsets/">it&#8217;s not always correct to insta-convert ethics into law</a>. I think in general they believe both that it&#8217;s important for a society to be virtuous, and that the government compelling people to exhibit more virtue than they possess can only go terribly wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But there has to be <i>some</i> subset who don&#8217;t believe in virtue at all, and think the Non-Aggression Principle is literally all there is! And all these weird thought experiments show <i>they&#8217;re</i> stupid, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I disagree with them but I&#8217;m hesitant to declare them stupid just based on a few experiments. I mean, I like to say &#8216;I&#8217;m against torture&#8217;, and I like to say this is a strong moral principle of mine and not just a maxim of convenience. But with enough effort, you could create a ridiculous ticking-time-bomb thought experiment in which being against torture led obviously and inexorably to horrible results. Have you proven that people who say they&#8217;re against torture are stupid? Or would you be willing to cut them some slack in this situation? And are you willing to cut the same slack to this tiny subset of fundamentalist Non-Aggression Principle libertarians? Thought experiments are <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/26/high-energy-ethics/">a useful tool</a>, but sometimes the best lesson to take from them is &#8216;things are complicated but principles still matter&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But surely, somewhere, there are incredibly stupid libertarians who think morality consists of the Non-Aggression Principle and nothing else, don&#8217;t believe in any other kind of virtue, and aren&#8217;t just holding it as a sacred but non-final principle the way you hold not torturing people?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay. Maybe there are. But how does it help to focus on this tiny pathological subset of libertarians and desperately try to convince the world that every libertarian is like this? There are some pretty pathological socialists too &#8211; should we demand everyone accept them as the only possible representatives of socialism? Should political discussion just be relentless weak-manning of the other side, with whoever is more simplistic winning the victory?&#8221;</p>
<p>Before Mr. Nett-Worth could respond, the bar we were in started to shake. &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; he asked me. &#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A disturbance in the Farce,&#8221; I said. &#8220;This world was created to provide stupid weak-man arguments against dumbed-down versions of libertarianism. I guess what I just said &#8211; it threatened the fabric of reality itself. Hold on to your seat. This could get pretty bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bartender suddenly stood up. &#8220;All blue-eyed people need to leave the bar now!&#8221; he said. &#8220;As a proud bigot, I refuse to serve blue-eyed people. I don&#8217;t care how much profit it costs me! And also, this is the only bar in this city &#8211; nay, in a five thousand mile radius! Now no blue-eyed person will be able to go to a bar ever again!&#8221;</p>
<p>Scarce had he finished speaking when a very-finely dressed woman stood up. &#8220;I am a billionaire,&#8221; she shouted. &#8220;And I will give poor people money to humiliate themselves. Anyone who goes to the farm and rolls around in pig excrement for an hour, I will give ten million dollars! And many of you have terminal diseases that require expensive treatments, so you&#8217;ll die if you refuse! Mwa ha ha! Roll in pig shit! ROLL, YOU PEASANTS!&#8221;</p>
<p>But her jubilation was interrupted by another man, in the other corner of the bar. &#8220;I am a factory owner, and I am off to go sexually harass all my employees. There are no laws against it, so nobody can stop me. And I own the only factory in the world, so my employees can&#8217;t leave. And dire wolves eat anyone who tries to start new factories. So there!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You fools,&#8221; said a wild-haired man near the window. &#8220;I will cleanse this city of scum like you. Since there were no laws against making atomic bombs, I have built a nuke in my basement. Soon I will set it off in a great purification. And there&#8217;s nothing you can do about it until it&#8217;s too late, because there&#8217;s <i>no law against owning nukes</i>. Nobody can stop me! NOBODY!&#8221;</p>
<p>I took a deep breath. &#8220;I can stop you,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I can stop all of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every face turned to look at me.</p>
<p>&#8220;This world runs on dumb weak-man objections to libertarianism. The only way to fight them is with even dumber weak-man objections to libertarianism. So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll do. Nobody, blue-eyed or not, is going to leave this bar.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bartender scowled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody, rich or poor, is going to go to the farm and roll in pig excrement.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rich woman looked skeptical.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to go your factory and harass your employees.&#8221;</p>
<p>The factory owner frowned.</p>
<p>&#8220;And <i>you</i> aren&#8217;t going to go set off your nuclear bomb. None of you are going anywhere!&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><font size="1"><i>[Spoiler warning for <A HREF="https://www.amazon.com/Silmarillion-J-R-R-Tolkien/dp/0618135049/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&#038;qid=1514328533&#038;sr=8-1&#038;linkCode=ll1&#038;tag=slatestarcode-20&#038;linkId=5ec80baf6613d15d413cb1b13f29ecb8">The Silmarillion</A>]</i></font></p>
<p><b>I.</b></p>
<p>The <i>Silmarillion</i> describes the fate of the three Silmarils. Earendil kept one, and traveled with it through the sky, where it became the planet Venus. Maedhros stole another, but regretted his deed and jumped into a fiery chasm. And Maglor took the last one, but threw it into the sea in despair.</p>
<p>Well, Venus is still around. But what happened to the latter two? Surely over all the intervening millennia, with so many people wanting a Silmaril, they haven&#8217;t just hung around in the earth and ocean?</p>
<p>After some research, I&#8217;ve developed a couple of promising leads for the location of the Silmarils in the Fifth Age.</p>
<p><b>II.</b></p>
<p>I <A HREF="https://slatestarscratchpad.tumblr.com/post/152824927151/slatestarscratchpad-slatestarscratchpad">previously sketched out</A> the argument that Maglor&#8217;s Silmaril probably belongs to a Los Angeles crime lord.</p>
<p>The movie <i>Pulp Fiction</i> centers around a mysterious briefcase. We&#8217;re never told exactly what&#8217;s inside, but we get some clues:</p>
<p>1. It’s described as “so beautiful” and captivates anyone who looks at it<br />
2. It shines with an inner light<br />
3. When Jules and Vincent are trying to get it, all the shots aimed at them miss, implying they’re miraculously immune to bullets, implying that they’re on some kind of divine quest.<br />
4. Marsellus Wallace really wants to get it, and keeps killing anyone else who has it</p>
<p>So far this is only suggestive, but there&#8217;s more. While searching for the briefcase, Jules (!) keeps quoting a verse:</p>
<blockquote><p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness, for he is truly his brother&#8217;s keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers.</p></blockquote>
<p>They describe this as Ezekiel 25:17, but <A HREF="http://truthbygrace.org/pulp-fiction-and-ezekiel-2517/">it isn&#8217;t</A>. In fact, it isn&#8217;t anywhere in the Bible, and it doesn&#8217;t match any Biblical story. This isn&#8217;t from the Old Testament at all. It&#8217;s a description of the life of Maglor in the <i>Silmarillion</i>!</p>
<p>During the First Age, Maglor ruled “Maglor’s Gap”, a valley which connected the lands of the Elves and the lands of Morgoth. Maglor held Maglor’s Gap for 450 years until Morgoth finally conquered the valley; Maglor led the retreat of his people, thus “shepherding the weak through the valley of darkness”.</p>
<p>He fled to the fortress of his brother, Maedhros, in Himling, where he helped defend Maedhros’ lands and people in battle &#8211; making him &#8220;his brother’s keeper&#8221;.</p>
<p>In the ensuing battles, he captured the young Elrond and Elros, who had been orphaned after their parents fled across the sea, and adopted them &#8211; making him “the finder of lost children”.</p>
<p>As for “striking down with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers”, that’s about as Noldor as it gets.</p>
<p>What is going on here, and why do we keep finding these connections to Maglor?</p>
<p>Maglor is unique as possibly the only Noldo still remaining in the world. According to <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maglor">Wikipedia</A>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Maglor, along with Galadriel and Gil-galad, was the greatest surviving Noldo at the beginning of the Second Age. There is speculation that he remained even after the Third Age in Middle-earth, forbidden forever from returning to Valinor.</p></blockquote>
<p>If he were still alive in our times, he would remain bound by his oath and be hunting the Silmaril. So: could Marsellus Wallace, the mysterious gang boss who wants the briefcase so badly, be Maglor himself? Given that the name &#8220;Maglor&#8221; is a Sindarinization of his birth name &#8220;Makalaure&#8221;, &#8220;Marsellus&#8221; doesn&#8217;t even sound like much of a pseudonym.</p>
<p>The main argument against this point is that Tolkien&#8217;s elves are usually depicted as fair-skinned and lithe, but Marsellus Wallace is shown in the movie as a big black guy. Does this disprove the theory?</p>
<p>It would, <i>unless</i> Marsellus were under some kind of magical glamor to hide his true appearance. And there’s actually some evidence for this.</p>
<p>There’s one character in <i>Pulp Fiction</i> who is clearly able to cast illusion-related magic: Mia Wallace. In the parking lot of the restaurant, she tells Vinnie “Don’t be a…”. Then she traces a square in the air with her finger, and the square appears in glittering light. Marsellus Wallace is married to someone who can cast visual illusions.</p>
<p>But why should we believe Marsellus’ appearance is itself such an illusion? Well, in the scene with Jules and Brett, Jules puts a gun to Brett’s head and asks him what Marsellus looks like. Brett says he looks like a tall bald black guy, which seems to satisfy Jules.</p>
<p>The hit men try to play this off as some kind of intimidation thing, but they’re just going to shoot Brett anyway &#8211; there’s no need to intimidate him. It would only make sense if they’re actually checking how Marsellus appears to Brett &#8211; ie whether a certain illusion he’s projecting is working. When they follow up with &#8220;Does he look like a bitch?“, this is their foul-mouthed way of asking whether he looks androgynous. When Brett confirms that he looks masculine, this seems to satisfy the hit men, who then go ahead and shoot him. Unclear why they’re expecting the illusion to fail in Brett’s case, but it seems like if it has they’ll need to interrogate him further and maybe track down anybody else who might have learned too much.</p>
<p>How is Mia Wallace able to cast these illusions?</p>
<p>I would guess that &#8220;Mia” is actually Maia, ie one of the Maiar who is sent from Valinor to guide Elves and Men with their good counsel and magic powers. There’s a previous example of a female Maia marrying an elflord to guide him: Melian and Thingol. Mia is following in this tradition, and just as Melian granted Thingol’s kingdom invulnerability to attack, so Mia grants Maglor/Marsellus the ability to look like a big muscular black guy.</p>
<p>We actually have further proof of this in the movie. Mia overdoses on heroin and goes unconscious. It looks like she goes a really long time without breathing. You get anoxic brain injury in like four or five minutes; Mia was out way longer than that. But once they give her adrenaline, she instantly and completely recuperates in a medically implausible way. Suffice it to say that she’s proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that she doesn’t have a human circulatory system, and given us at least strong evidence that she is literally immortal.</p>
<p>I would guess that Maglor survived, found his Silmaril, lost his Silmaril again, and that <i>Pulp Fiction</i> is an account of him getting it back. &#8220;Quentin Tarantino&#8221; is probably a made-up pen name for a group of elvish historians &#8211; the name &#8220;Quentin&#8221; obviously deriving from &#8220;Quendi&#8221;, the elvish word for elves. &#8220;Tarantino&#8221; is more obscure, but it may be a reference to <A HREF="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Tar-Atanamir">Tar-Atanamir</A>, the Numenorean king who refused to die when his time came &#8211; something which must carry a lot of metaphorical associations for any elves remaining on Earth.</p>
<p>If all of this is true, Maglor&#8217;s Silmaril probably remains with Maglor in his Los Angeles mansion.</p>
<p><b>III.</b></p>
<p>The fate of Maedhros&#8217; Silmaril is less clear, but one promising possibility is linked with the fate of Utumno.</p>
<p>Utumno was the fortress of the dark god Melkor before the First Age. It was built in the far north of Middle-Earth, &#8220;upon the borders of the regions of everlasting cold&#8221;. <A HREF="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Dor_Daidelos">Tolkien Gateway writes</A> that &#8220;the frigid temperatures of the northern regions were thought to originate from the evil of [Melkor&#8217;s] realm&#8221;.</p>
<p>What was Utumno like? Like most of Tolkien&#8217;s villains, Melkor was at least partly a technologist; his realm was one of forges and smithies ceaselessly building weapons for his war against the gods. <A HREF="http://www.thelandofshadow.com/utumno/">This page</A> describes it as &#8220;a fortress for war, with many armories, forges, dungeons and breeding pits.&#8221; Some of the descriptions sound like it was emitting pollution, destroying the land around it: &#8220;The lands of the far north were all made desolate in those days; for there Utumno was delved exceeding deep, and its pits were filled with fires and with great hosts of the servants of Melkor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Who manned these factories? Enslaved elves. As per the book, &#8220;All those of the Quendi who came into the hands of Melkor, ere Utumno was broken, were put there in prison, and by slow arts of cruelty were corrupted and enslaved&#8221;.</p>
<p>Eventually the gods decided enough was enough and marched against Utumno with a mighty host led by Tulkas, God of War. He wrestled with Melkor, defeated him, and bound him with a mighty chain.</p>
<p>What happened to Utumno after this? The <i>Silmarillion</i> is vague, but in retrospect it&#8217;s super obvious. <i>What happened to the magical factory at the North Pole run by elves?</i> Everyone knows the answer to that one!</p>
<p>Presumably Tulkas and the other gods, after defeating Melkor, decided it was poetically appropriate to turn Utumno from a place of darkness to a wonderland of holiday cheer. The elves agreed to stay on to help, and they repurposed Melkor&#8217;s forges to create toys for children around the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Santa Claus&#8221; supposedly derives from St. Nicholas, on the grounds that &#8220;Santa&#8221; means &#8220;saint&#8221; and &#8220;Claus&#8221; is short for &#8220;Nicholas&#8221;. But &#8220;Santa&#8221; means a female saint; a male saint is &#8220;San&#8221;. Santa is male, so a more reasonable derivation would be &#8220;San Tulkas&#8221;. Once a year, Tulkas goes forth and distributes the toys created by the elves of Utumno.</p>
<p>(remember, the <i>Silmarillion</i> describes Tulkas as a huge bearded man who &#8220;laughs ever, in sport or in war, and even in the face of Melkor he laughed in battles before the Elves were born&#8221;. And remember, of his wife Nessa, it says &#8220;Deer she loves, and they follow her train whenever she goes in the wild&#8221;. Having deer follow your family around everywhere seems sounds pretty annoying, but at least it gives you a ready-made supply of draft animals.)</p>
<p>Since we never see Santa&#8217;s workshop, it must be hidden from the world in the same manner as the Undying Lands. How does Tulkas cross back into the mortal world to deliver gifts?</p>
<p>The only successful example of such a journey we have from Tolkien is that of Earendil, who travels from Middle-Earth to the Undying Lands using a Silmaril worn on his brow. Later, even after the two worlds are separated entirely, he is able use the same Silmaril to voyage through the sky in his flying boat. &#8220;The wise have said that it was by reason of the power of that holy jewel that they came in time to waters that no vessels save those of the Teleri had known&#8221;. So presumably any living being with a Silmaril upon their head can fly through the gulfs between the worlds safely.</p>
<p>Tulkas is a god and should have no trouble finding the only unclaimed Silmaril, the one Maedhros dropped into a chasm in the earth. His main issue would be preventing the surviving Noldor from learning what he has and invoking their vendetta. He would have to disguise it as something else, something so ridiculous that the stick-up-their-ass Noldor would never think to identify it with their holy jewels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Alchemist asked if I wanted a drink. I did, but no amount of staring could make my eyes settle on the color of the liquid in the flask. And the gold the alchemists paid the taxmen smelled funny and made crackling noises. I declined. </p>
<p>I took the summons and set it on the table between us. The King&#8217;s son was dying. The doctors, astrologers, witches, and other assorted wise people of the kingdom could not save him. The King had asked for an alchemist, and been given one. He, too, had failed. But he had let on that there were other alchemists in the guild, greater alchemists, who knew far more than he. So the king had demanded that all the guild&#8217;s top alchemists come to the palace and try to save his son&#8217;s life. And the alchemists&#8217; guild had refused, saying their studies could not be interrupted.</p>
<p>So here I was, come to make the request again, more formally but less politely.</p>
<p>The Alchemist pretended to read the parchment. I could tell he was faking; his eyes stayed still the whole time. Finally he gave me the same answer he had given the king&#8217;s courier: the alchemists&#8217; studies could not be interrupted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why is a few weeks subtracted from your studies more important than the prince&#8217;s life?&#8221; I demanded, staring straight into his creepy too-still eyes.</p>
<p>He spent too long not answering. I worried I&#8217;d broken him, that he was some kind of intricate clockwork machine and I&#8217;d yelled too loud and shifted a gear out of place. Finally he asked: &#8220;How long would you have to study architecture before you could build a castle like this one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no architect,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I&#8217;m a man of war.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. So how long would you have to study, before you were an architect?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten years?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;Twenty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why so? There are books of architecture, some of them written by men far greater than the planner of this castle. Some are five hundred pages long, others a thousand. Are you so slow a reader, that it would take you ten years to read a thousand pages?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t just read a book and know architecture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because&#8230;you wouldn&#8217;t&#8230;&#8221; I had been annoyed when he first asked, but now I found the question interesting, at least amusing. Why <i>couldn&#8217;t</i> a great architect write his knowledge down in a book? And why <i>couldn&#8217;t</i> I read it and become as good as he?</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you&#8217;d have to memorize it all,&#8221; I finally concluded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so. I will let you carry the book with you as you build the castle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t help. It wouldn&#8217;t be&#8230;indexed properly in my head. I would want to build a wall, and I wouldn&#8217;t even know what things to consider when building a wall, and I would have to search the whole book for them each time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a man of war,&#8221; repeated the Alchemist. &#8220;Do you know Caesar&#8217;s histories?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost by heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you as good a general as Caesar?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>I took his point. Caesar had written down everything he could about war. I had mastered all of it. But I was no Caesar. It couldn&#8217;t just be the difficulty of memorizing books.</p>
<p>&#8220;Knowledge,&#8221; said the Alchemist, &#8220;is harder to transmit than anyone appreciates. One can write down the structure of a certain arch, or the tactical considerations behind a certain strategy. But above those are higher skills, skills we cannot name or appreciate. Caesar could glance at a battlefield and know precisely which lines were reliable and which were about to break. Vitruvius could see a great basilica in his mind&#8217;s eye, every wall and column snapping into place. We call this wisdom. It is not unteachable, but neither can it be taught. Do you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>I did. If I trained with Caesar for years, some of his skill at reading a battlefield might rub off on me; I might dimly see the outlines of his genius. But he couldn&#8217;t just tell me. It wasn&#8217;t a secret which he hid from other men to remain above them. It was a power belonging to him alone, only partially transferable.</p>
<p>&#8220;So imagine,&#8221; continued the Alchemist, &#8220;that you wanted to build the simplest of structures. A cottage for peasants. How long would you have to study architecture under Vitruvius before you could do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>This time I didn&#8217;t bother protesting that I didn&#8217;t know. I just guessed. &#8220;A year?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And suppose you want to build something more complex. An aqueduct, every bit the equal of the Romans&#8217;. How long?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Five years?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some grand building, a palace or temple?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;ten years?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The grandest building in the world. St. Peter&#8217;s Basilica, or the Pantheon, or Chartres Cathedral, or something new that combines the virtues of all three.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How should I know? Twenty years? Thirty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you believe me if I said it was two hundred years?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. The human lifespan is three score and ten. If you needed more than seventy years of studying architecture to design St. Peter&#8217;s, it would never have gotten designed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said the Alchemist, &#8220;we have discovered something surprising. The art of architecture is limited by the human lifespan. The greatest building that can ever be designed is the one that would take seventy years of studying architecture to master; God has drawn a line in the sand forever closing off buildings grander than these.&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought for a second. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t seem right. There are new innovations every year. The flying buttress, stained glass, the pointed arch. The Romans had none of these. We progress not only by studying the works of Vitruvius, but by pushing beyond him. Perhaps it takes a century for someone to invent the buttress, but once it is invented, only weeks for other architects to observe it and understand it well enough to incorporate into their own buildings. Architecture does not advance only architect by architect, but also civilization by civilization.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you skilled at mathematics?&#8221; asked the Alchemist.</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we will talk this over, though rightfully it should be an equation. The first term is the speed at which a student can absorb already-discovered architectural knowledge. The second term is the speed at which a master can discover new knowledge. The third term represents the degree to which one must already be on the frontier of knowledge to make new discoveries; at zero, everyone discovers equally regardless of what they already know; at one, one must have mastered every previously-discovered fact before one can discover anything new. The fourth term represents potential for specialization; at one, it is impossible to understand any part without understanding the whole; at zero, it can be subdivided freely. The fifth&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think saying it in words makes the math easier to understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah. Well, imagine a science that takes one-tenth as long for a student to understand, as it did a master to discover. And imagine that one cannot advance the science until one understands everything that has already been discovered. And one cannot split the burden; tell one architect &#8216;Oh, you learn how to make walls, I will learn how to make roofs&#8217; &#8211; a single genius must understand the whole building, every part must fit together perfectly. We can calculate how far the art can advance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The first student has no master, and must discover everything himself. He researches for 70 years, then writes his wisdom into a book before he dies. The second student reads the book, and in 7 years, he has learned 70 years of research. Then he does his own original research for 63 years and writes a book containing 133 years of research. The third student reads for 13.3 years, then does his own research for 66.7 years, ending up with 200 years. Imagine going further and further. After many generations, 690 years of research have been done, and it takes a student 69 years to master them. The student only has one year left of life to research further, leaving the world with 691 years of research total. So the cycle creeps onward, always approaching but never quite reaching 700 years of architectural research.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t work that way,&#8221; I protested, partly because it didn&#8217;t, and partly because something about the story distressed me more than I could say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in architecture. An architect who has not yet mastered the entire field can still make discoveries. And the field can be split &#8211; I can work on walls while you work on windows. It would only work that way if there were an Art so unified, so perfect, that a seeker had to know the totality of what had been discovered before, if he wanted to know anything at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you really could never advance past 700 years of knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You would have to be clever. We imagine each master writing down his knowledge in a book for the student who comes after, and each student reading it at a rate of ten times as quickly as the master discovered it. But what if there was a third person in between, an editor, who reads the book not to learn the contents, but to learn how to rewrite it better and more clearly? Someone whose job it is to figure out perfect analogies, clever shortcuts, new ways of graphing and diagramming the information involved. After he has processed the master&#8217;s notes, he redacts them into a textbook which can teach in only a twentieth the time it took the master to discover.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we could double the amount of research that could eventually be completed, to 1400 years&#8217; worth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not easily. Remember, the editors face the same problem as the students: they can only redact knowledge they themselves understand. We are adding many new people, and many generations of work, to the problem. But in the end, yes, you could accumulate 1400 years of knowledge. What if you wanted more?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm. You&#8230;could get more layers of redactors. Redactors of redactors, to make the textbooks truly perfect.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps what you are trying to say is that redaction is an Art.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Alchemist made the the capital letter unmistakeable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every Art has its own structure. Architecture, with enough study, can allow you to accumulate seven hundred years of collected knowledge. How many years could redactors and tutors accumulate? Would some first redactor have to spend seventy years coming up with principles of redaction to pass down to his student, who advances the art by sixty-three more years, which he passes down in turn? Would a 1400-year redactor be an incomprehensible master, able to build whole basilicas of redaction, a master teacher who could frame any concepts to make it intuitive and memorable?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I changed my mind. I&#8217;m going to have that drink.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Alchemist poured me the liquid of indeterminate color. I took a sip. It reminded me of nothing I had ever tasted before, but very slightly of the letter &#8220;N&#8221;. More important, I was pretty sure it was alcoholic.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re talking about an infinite regress&#8221;, I said, when I had finished the glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not infinite. Architects. Teachers. Teachers of teachers, but the art of teaching teaching is much the same as the art of teaching. Three levels is enough. Though the levels have to mix. The teacher who trains the next architect must be a master both of teaching and of architecture. I will spare you the math, but one needs a series of teachers at different points on the teaching-skill/architecture-skill tradeoff-curve. One will be a master teacher who has devoted decades to learning the textbook-writing skill, and who can write a brilliant Introduction To Architecture textbook that makes the first ten years of architecture ability seem perfectly natural and easy to master. Another will be a mediocre teacher who knows enough advanced architecture to write a passable textbook on the subject. Still another will do nothing but study pure Teaching itself, in the hopes that he can one day pass on this knowledge to others who will use it to write architecture textbooks. In practice we are limited to a few strategic points on the tradeoff curve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In practice?&#8221;</p>
<p>He motioned for me to get up. We walked through dark corridors until we reached a courtyard, bathed in the glow of the full moon. It took me a second to see it. Then the dull shapes took form. Obelisks, covered in hieroglyphs. A garden of obelisks.</p>
<p>&#8220;The word &#8216;alchemy&#8217; comes from &#8216;al-Kemi&#8217;, the Arabic word from Egypt. It was the ancient Egyptians who first considered the project. They didn&#8217;t want the Philosophers&#8217; Stone, not at first. They just wanted normal philosophers. But philosophy, more than other subjects, requires the wisdom that comes with age. More than other subjects, a philosophy book cannot merely be read; it must be digested, intermingled with life experience, wrestled with. The Egyptians scholars ran into precisely the problem as our hypothetical architects &#8211; there were secrets that evaded the human lifespan.</p>
<p>&#8220;So they wondered whether a way to cheat death might be found. The answer was both exciting and discouraging. Through the mysteries of spiritual chemistry, an elixir might be created which would grant immortality. But the Work itself would take far more knowledge than any one man could accumulate. The symbol of alchemists is the ouroboros because our task loops back upon itself. In order to become immortal, you must first become immortal.</p>
<p>&#8220;All we could do was go the slow way, the same as the architects working on their great basilica, for generation after generation. So Egypt fell, but we did not fall. Rome passed away, but we did not pass. A few lines, the remnants of the old priestly families of Hierakonopolis and Memphis, continued the work. To stop would be to reset a process requiring four thousand years of gradual asymptotic improvement all the way to the beginning &#8211; texts are not worthless, but only the true tutors trained by tutor-tutors trained by tutor-tutor-tutors are fit to tutor an alchemist. A misstep is too terrible to contemplate. But any victory &#8211; a single vial of the Elixir, a single fragment of the stone &#8211; would end the nightmare forever. We would have an immortal, a philosopher whose lifespan finally matches the depth of the challenges Nature throws at us.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is our guild&#8217;s mission. A few of us, those who pass all their tests, do the alchemic research that moves the Work onwards. Others train to be teachers, or teachers-of-teachers. Those who fail a test somewhere along the way stay in the guild, managing its worldly affairs. Some scour the countryside for prodigies to take in and train as apprentices. Others manage our finances. And the very least capable, like me, have time to waste talking to outsiders, trying to convince them of our mission. A few centuries more, and we will have the Stone. Does that satisfy your curiosity?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All except my original question. Are you so busy that you cannot spare a few weeks for the prince?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God does not make the Great Work easy. We have done all we can to train our alchemists, our tutors, our tutor-tutors, and so on, yet in the end, the limit of human skill is the same place the possibility of success begins. It is His will to grind us up to the very asymptote.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I still don&#8217;t get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember the architects who learned at ten times the rate they researched, the ones who would never accumulate more than 700 years of learning? The fiftieth alchemist in the sequence has 696 years of learning, and is able to do a scant five months&#8217; original research before his death. The hundredth alchemist has 699.98 years of learning, and is able to do about a day&#8217;s research before dying. We are not so far along as all that, but we are far. We do not have the Stone, but we have tinctures that can stabilize the lifespan, make sure nobody dies before their time. The last few generations &#8211; on their deathbed, they say they can almost <i>taste</i> the Stone, that it lies only a few hours of further thought beyond their level. They say of my grandfather that he realized the recipe for the Stone on his deathbed, that he started speaking it, but that his eyes closed forever before he could complete the ingredient list.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ask that we pause a few weeks from our studies to save the prince&#8217;s life. Pausing a few weeks would set us back generations. This far into the project, only the last few hours of an Alchemist&#8217;s life are of any value at all. We cannot spare the prince hours. We cannot even spare him seconds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then your teachers&#8230;or your teacher-teachers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Know some alchemy, but are in the same situation. Our textbooks have been so perfectly written and rewritten over the years that it is only in the last few days of a teacher&#8217;s life that he is skilled enough to write a better one. And our teacher-training has become so perfect that it is only in the last few days of a teacher-trainer&#8217;s life that he is qualified to create teachers better than the ones who already exist.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no slack in the system at all?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only me, and those like me. Those judged unfit for research and condemned to worldly matters. We sent you one already. He failed you, as he did us. We have nothing more to give.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The king will not be happy. And the Prince will die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone dies,&#8221; said the Alchemist. &#8220;If the prince does not die this year, he will die the next, or fifty years hence. The question is not when we die, but what our life adds to the Work which accumulates in spite of time. Quicksilver evaporates to nothing unless reacted with aqua fortis; but the part which is reacted endures forever. Those lives not part of any Work mean as little to me as they will one day mean to their possessors; those which add to the Work are more precious than gold. Tell the King this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t understand,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you will have to teach him,&#8221; said the Alchemist, &#8220;as I taught you, and my tutors taught me, and as their tutors taught them, all the way back to the first philosophers of Egypt.&#8221; </p>
<p>He stared at me as he spoke, and the blackness in his too-still pupils was the depth of Time.</p>
