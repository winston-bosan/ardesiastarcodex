				<p>Normally this would be a hidden thread, but I wanted to signal boost <A HREF="https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2020/06/support-freedom-of-ideas-and-inquiry-at.html">this request for help</A> by Professor Steve Hsu, vice president of research at Michigan State University. Hsu is a friend of the blog and was a guest speaker at one of our recent online meetups &#8211; some of you might also have gotten a chance to meet him at <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/02/bay-area-ssc-meetup-1-6/">a Berkeley meetup</A> last year. He and his blog <A HREF="https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2009/09/some-favorite-posts.html">Information Processing</A> have also been instrumental in helping me and thousands of other people better understand genetics and neuroscience. If you&#8217;ve met him, you know he is incredibly kind, patient, and willing to go to great lengths to help improve people&#8217;s scientific understanding.</p>
<p>Along with all the support he&#8217;s given me personally, he&#8217;s had an amazing career. He started as a theoretical physicist publishing work on black holes and quantum information. Then he transitioned into genetics, spent a while as scientific advisor to the Beijing Genomics Institute, and helped discover genetic prediction algorithms for gallstones, melanoma, heart attacks, and other conditions. Along with his academic work, he also sounded the alarm about the coronavirus early and has been helping shape the response.</p>
<p>This week, some students at Michigan State are trying to cancel him. They point an interview he did on an alt-right podcast (he says it wasn&#8217;t alt-right when he interviewed on it), to his allowing MSU to conduct research on police shootings (which concluded, like most such research, that they are generally not racially motivated), and to his occasional discussion of the genetics of race (basically just repeating the same &#8220;variance between vs. within clusters&#8221; distinction everyone else does, see eg <A HREF="https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2008/01/no-scientific-basis-for-race.html">here</A>). You can read the case being made against him <A HREF="https://twitter.com/GradEmpUnion/status/1270829003130261504">here</A>, although keep in mind a lot of it is distorted and taken out of context, and you can read his response <A HREF="https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2020/06/twitter-attacks-and-defense-of.html">here</A>.</p>
<p>Professor Hsu will probably land on his feet whatever happens, but it would be a great loss for Michigan and its scientific community if he could no longer work with them; it would also have a chilling effect on other scientists who want to discuss controversial topics or engage with the public. If you support him, you can sign the petition to keep him on <A HREF="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14n8AJuUpRooDJAZYdRIp2gdEkkKjmnOOH5FOJ8ESmRs/edit">here</A>. If you are a professor or other notable person, your voice could be especially helpful, but anyone is welcome to sign regardless of credentials or academic status. See <A HREF="https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2020/06/support-freedom-of-ideas-and-inquiry-at.html">here</A> for more information. He says that time is of the essence since activists are pressuring the college to make a decision right away while everyone is still angry.</p>
<p>This was supposed to be a culture-war free open thread, but I guess the ship has sailed on that one, so, uh, just do your best, and I&#8217;ll delete anything that needs deleting.</p>

				<p><b>I.</b></p>
<p>One of psychiatry&#8217;s many embarrassments is how many of our drugs get discovered by accident. They come from <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valproate#History">random plants</A> or <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium#Medicine">shiny rocks</A> or <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/08/11/book-review-pihkal/">stuff Alexander Shulgin invented to get high</A>.</p>
<p>But every so often, somebody tries to do things the proper way. Go over decades of research into what makes psychiatric drugs work and how they could work better. Figure out the hypothetical properties of the ideal psych drug. Figure out a molecule that matches those properties. Synthesize it and see what happens. This was the vision of vortioxetine and vilazodone, two antidepressants from the early 2010s. They were approved by the FDA, sent to market, and prescribed to millions of people. Now it&#8217;s been enough time to look back and give them a fair evaluation. And&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;and it&#8217;s been a good reminder of why we don&#8217;t usually do this.</p>
<p>Enough data has come in to be pretty sure that vortioxetine and vilazodone, while effective antidepressants, are no better than the earlier medications they sought to replace. I want to try going over the science that led pharmaceutical companies to think these two drugs might be revolutionary, and then speculate on why they weren&#8217;t. I&#8217;m limited in this by my total failure to understand several important pieces of the pathways involved, so I&#8217;ll explain the parts I get, and list the parts I don&#8217;t in the hopes that someone clears them up in the comments.</p>
<p><b>II.</b></p>
<p>SSRIs take about a month to work. This is surprising, because they start increasing serotonin immediately. If higher serotonin <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/05/chemical-imbalance/">is associated with</A> improved mood, why the delay?</p>
<p>Most <A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4048143/">research</A> focuses on presynaptic 5-HT1A autoreceptors, which detect and adjust the amount of serotonin being released in order to maintain homeostasis. If that sounds clear as mud to you, well, it did to me too the first twenty times I heard it. Here&#8217;s the analogy which eventually worked for me:</p>
<p>Imagine you&#8217;re a salesperson who teleconferences with customers all day. You&#8217;re bad at projecting your voice &#8211; sometimes it&#8217;s too soft, sometimes too loud. Your boss tells you the right voice level for sales is 60 decibels. So you put an audiometer on your desk that measures how many decibels your voice is. It displays an up arrow, down arrow, or smiley face, telling you that you&#8217;re being too quiet, loud, or just right.</p>
<p>The audiometer is presynaptic (it&#8217;s on your side of the teleconference, not your customer&#8217;s side). It&#8217;s an autoreceptor, not a heteroreceptor (you&#8217;re using it to measure yourself, not to measure anything else). And you&#8217;re using it to maintain homeostasis (to keep your voice at 60 dB).</p>
<p>Suppose you take a medication that stimulates your larynx and makes your voice naturally louder. As long as your audiometer&#8217;s working, that medication will have no effect. Your voice will naturally be louder, but that means you&#8217;ll see the down arrow on your audiometer more often, you&#8217;ll speak with less force, and the less force and louder voice will cancel out and keep you at 60 dB. No change.</p>
<p>This is what happens with antidepressants. The antidepressant increases serotonin levels (ie sends a louder signal). But if the presynaptic 5-HT1A autoreceptors are intact, they tell the cells that the signal is too loud and they should release less serotonin. So they do, and now we&#8217;re back where we started &#8211; ie depressed.</p>
<p>(Why don&#8217;t the autoreceptors notice the original problem &#8211; that you have too little serotonin and are depressed &#8211; and work their magic there? Not sure. Maybe depression affects whatever sets the autoreceptors, and causes them to be set too low? Maybe the problem is with reception, not transmission? Maybe you have the right amount of serotonin, but you want excessive amounts of serotonin because that would fix a problem somewhere else? Maybe you should have paid extra for the premium model of presynaptic autoreceptor?)</p>
<p>So how come antidepressants work after a month? The only explanation I&#8217;ve heard is that the  autoreceptors get &#8220;saturated&#8221;, which is a pretty nonspecific term. I think it means that there&#8217;s a <i>second</i> negative feedback loop controlling the first negative feedback loop &#8211; the cell notices there is way more autoreceptor activity than expected and assumes it is producing too many autoreceptors. Over the course of a month, it stops producing more autoreceptors, the existing autoreceptors gradually degrade, and presynaptic autoreception stops being a problem. In our salesperson analogy, after a while you notice that your audiometer doesn&#8217;t match your own perception of how much effort you&#8217;re putting into speaking &#8211; no matter how quietly you feel like you&#8217;re whispering, the audiometer just keeps saying you&#8217;re yelling very loud. Eventually you declare it defective, throw it out, and just speak naturally. Now the larynx-stimulating medication <i>can</i> make your voice louder.</p>
<p>In the late &#8217;90s, some scientists wondered &#8211; what happens if you just block the 5-HT1A autoreceptors directly? At the very least, seems like you could make antidepressants work a month faster. Best case scenario, you can make antidepressants work <i>better</i>. Maybe after a month, the cells have lost <i>some</i> confidence in the autoreceptors, but they&#8217;re still keeping serotonin somewhere below the natural amount based on the anomalous autoreceptor reading. So maybe blocking the autoreceptors would mean a faster, better, antidepressant.</p>
<p>The relevant autoreceptors are called 5-HT1A receptors, and luckily we already knew a chemical that could block them &#8211; pindolol. Pindolol is a blood-pressure-lowering medication, but by coincidence it also makes it into the brain and blocks this particular autoreceptor involved in serotonin homeostasis. So a few people started giving pindolol along with antidepressants. What happened? According to <A HREF="https://ebmh.bmj.com/content/7/4/107">some small unconvincing systematic reviews</A>, it did seem to kind of help make antidepressants work faster, but according to <A HREF="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hup.2465">some other small unconvincing meta-analyses</A> it probably didn&#8217;t make them work any better. It just made antidepressants go from taking about four weeks to work, to taking one or two weeks to work. It also gave patients dizziness, drowsiness, weakness, and all the other things you would expect from giving a blood-pressure-lowering medication to people with normal blood pressure. So people decided it probably wasn&#8217;t worth it. </p>
<p><b>III.</b></p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s buspirone.</p>
<p>Buspirone is generally considered a 5-HT1A agonist. The reality is a little more complicated; it&#8217;s a full agonist of presynaptic autoreceptors, and a partial agonist of postsynaptic autoreceptors(uh, imagine the customer in the other side of the teleconference also has an audiometer). </p>
<p>Buspirone has a weak anti-anxiety effect. It may also weakly increase sex drive, which is a nice contrast to SSRIs, which decrease (some would say &#8220;destroy&#8221;) sex drive. Flibanserin, a similar drug, is FDA-approved as a sex drive enhancer.</p>
<p>Buspirone stimulates presynaptic autoreceptors, which should cause cells to release less serotonin. Since high serotonin levels (eg with SSRIs) decreases sex drive, it makes sense that buspirone should increase sex drive. So far, so good. </p>
<p>But why is buspirone anxiolytic? I have just read a dozen papers purporting to address this question, and they might as well have been written in Chinese for all I was able to get from them. <A HREF="https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(09)00392-8/pdf">Some of them</A> just say that decreasing serotonin levels decreases anxiety, which would probably come as a surprise to anyone on SSRIs, anyone who does tryptophan depletion studies, anyone who measures serotonin metabolites in the spinal fluid, etc. Obviously it must be more complicated than this. But how? I can&#8217;t find any explanation. </p>
<p>A few books and papers <A HREF="https://books.google.com/books?id=h7lva61Muq4C&#038;pg=PA331&#038;lpg=PA331&#038;dq=buspirone+desensitizes+presynaptic+autoreceptors&#038;source=bl&#038;ots=AyBkjBrZw0&#038;sig=ACfU3U0ivAN_NSngnyZrCmLhRcmFsa_uCA&#038;hl=en&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=2ahUKEwiFqfiyjoDqAhUXsJ4KHRGnDvMQ6AEwC3oECAwQAQ#v=onepage&#038;q=buspirone%20desensitizes%20presynaptic%20autoreceptors&#038;f=false">take a completely different tack</A> and argue that buspirone just does the same thing SSRIs do &#8211; desensitize the presynaptic autoreceptors until the cells ignore them &#8211; and then has its antianxiety action through stimulating postsynaptic receptors. But if it&#8217;s doing the same thing as SSRIs, how come it has the opposite effect on sex drive? And how come there are some studies suggesting that it&#8217;s helpful to add buspirone onto SSRIs? Why isn&#8217;t that just doubling up on the same thing?</p>
<p>I am deeply grateful to SSC commenter Scchm for <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/04/30/buspirone-shortage-in-healthcaristan-ssr/#comment-748930">presenting an argument that this is all wrong</A>, and buspirone acts on D4 receptors, both in its anxiolytic and pro-sexual effects. This would neatly resolve the issues above. But then how come nobody else mentions this? How come everyone else seems to think buspirone makes sense, and writes whole papers about it without using the sentence &#8220;what the hell all of this is crazy&#8221;?</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s one more mystery: after the pindolol studies, everyone just sort of started assuming buspirone would work the same way pindolol did. This doesn&#8217;t really make sense pharmacologically &#8211; pindolol is an <i>antagonist</i> at presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors; buspirone is an <i>agonist</i> of same. And it doesn&#8217;t actually work in real life &#8211; someone <A HREF="https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/0014-2999(96)00185-9">did a study</A>, and the study found it didn&#8217;t work. Still, and I have no explanation for this, people got excited about this possibility. If buspirone could work like pindolol, then we would have a chemical that made antidepressants work faster, <i>and</i> treated anxiety, <i>and</i> reduced sexual dysfunction.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s one <i>more</i> mystery &#8211; okay, you have unrealistically high expectations for buspirone, fine, give people buspirone along with their SSRI. Lots of psychiatrists do this, it&#8217;s not really my thing, but it&#8217;s not a <i>bad</i> idea. But instead, the people making this argument became obsessed with the idea of finding a single chemical that combined SSRI-like activity with buspirone-like activity. A dual serotonin-transporter-inhibitor and 5-HT1A partial agonist became a pharmacological holy grail.</p>
<p><b>IV.</b></p>
<p>After a lot of people in lab coats poured things from one test tube to another, Merck announced they had found such a chemical, which they called vilazodone (Viibryd®).</p>
<p>Vilazodone is an SSRI and 5-HT1A partial agonist. I can&#8217;t find how its exact partial agonist profile differs from buspirone, except that it&#8217;s more of a postsynaptic agonist, whereas buspirone is more of a postsynaptic antagonist. I don&#8217;t know if this makes a difference.</p>
<p>The FDA approved vilazodone to treat depression, so it &#8220;works&#8221; in that sense. But does its high-tech promise pan out? Is it really faster-acting, anxiety-busting, and less likely to cause sexual side effects?</p>
<p>On a chemical level, things look promising. <A HREF="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12183683/">This study</A> finds that vilazodone elevates serotonin faster and higher than Prozac does in mice. And this is kind of grim, but <A HREF="https://emcrit.org/toxhound/dont-pick-the-scab/">toxicologists have noticed</A> that vilazodone overdoses are much more likely to produce serotonin toxicity than Prozac overdoses, which fits what you would expect if vilazodone successfully breaks the negative feedback system that keeps serotonin in a normal range.</p>
<p>On a clinical level, maybe not. Proponents of vilazodone <A HREF="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25470094/">got excited about</A> a study where vilazodone showed effects as early as week two. But &#8220;SSRIs take four weeks to work&#8221; is a rule of thumb, not a natural law. You always get a couple of people who get some effect early on, and if your study population is big enough, that&#8217;ll show up as a positive result. So you need to compare vilazodone to an SSRI directly. The only group I know who tried this, <A HREF="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25500685/">Matthews et al</A>, found no difference &#8211; in fact, vilazodone was nonsignificantly slower (<A HREF="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25500685/#&#038;gid=article-figures&#038;pid=fig-1-uid-0 ">relevant figure</A>). There&#8217;s no sign of vilazodone working any better either.</p>
<p>What about sexual side effects? Vilazodone does better than SSRIs <A HREF="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-015-4198-1">in rats</A>, but whatever. There&#8217;s supposedly <A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4457500/">a human study</A> &#8211; from the same Matthews et al team as above &#8211; but sexual side effects were so rare in all groups that it&#8217;s hard to draw any conclusions. This is bizarre &#8211; they had a thousand patients, and only 15 reported decreased libido (and no more in the treatment groups than the placebo group). Maybe God just hates antidepressant studies and makes sure they never find anything, and this is just as true when you&#8217;re studying side effects as it is when you&#8217;re studying efficacy. </p>
<p><A HREF="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1743609515301466">Clayton et al</A> do their own study of vilazodone&#8217;s sexual side effects. They find that overall vilazodone improves sexual function over placebo, probably because they used a scale that was very sensitive to the kind of bad sexual function you get when you&#8217;re depressed, and not as sensitive to the kind you get on antidepressants. But they did measure how many people who didn&#8217;t start out with sexual dysfunction got it during the trial, and this number was 1% of the placebo group and 8% of the vilazodone group. How many people would have gotten dysfunction on an SSRI? We don&#8217;t know because they didn&#8217;t include an active comparator. Usually I expect about 30 &#8211; 50% of people to get sexual side effects on SSRIs, but that&#8217;s based on me asking them and not on whatever strict criteria they use for studies. Remember, the Matthews study was able to find only 1.5% of people getting sexual side effects! So we shouldn&#8217;t even try to estimate how this compares. All we can say is that vilazodone definitely doesn&#8217;t have <i>no</i> sexual side effects.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t find any studies evaluating vilazodone vs. anything else for anxiety, but I also can&#8217;t find any patients saying vilazodone treated their anxiety especially well.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s really only one clear and undeniable difference between vilazodone and ordinary SSRIs, which is that vilazodone costs $290 a month, whereas other SSRIs cost somewhere in the single digits (Lexapro costs $7.31). If you&#8217;re paying for vilazodone, you can take comfort in knowing your money helped fund a pretty cool research program that had some interesting science behind it. But I&#8217;m not sure it actually panned out.</p>
<p><b>V.</b></p>
<p>Encouraged by Merck&#8217;s success&#8230;</p>
<p>(not necessarily clinical success, success at getting people to pay $290 a month for an antidepressant)</p>
<p>&#8230;Takeda and Lundbeck announced their own antidepressant with 5-HT1A partial agonist action, vortioxetine. They originally gave it the trade name Brintellix®, but upon its US release people kept confusing it with the unrelated medication Brilinta®, so Takeda/Lundbeck agreed to change the name to Trintellix® for the American market.</p>
<p>Vortioxetine claimed to have an advantage over its competitor vilazodone, in that it also antagonized 5-HT3 receptors. 5-HT3 receptors are weird. They&#8217;re the only ion channel based serotonin receptors, and they&#8217;re not especially involved in mood or anxiety. They do only one thing, and they do it well: they make you really nauseous. If you&#8217;ve ever felt nauseous on an SSRI, 5-HT3 agonism is why. And if you&#8217;ve ever taken Zofran (ondansetron) for nausea, you&#8217;ve benefitted from its 5-HT3 antagonism. Most antidepressants potentially cause nausea; since vortioxetine also treats nausea, presumably you break even and are no more nauseous than you were before taking it. Also, there are complicated theoretical reasons to believe maybe 5-HT3 antagonism is kind of like 5-HT1A antagonism in that it speeds the antidepressant response.</p>
<p>After this Takeda and Lundbeck kind of just went crazy, claiming effects on more and more serotonin receptors. It&#8217;s a 5-HT7 antagonist! (what is 5-HT7? No psychiatrist had ever given a second&#8217;s thought to this receptor before vortioxetine came out, but apparently it&#8230;exists to make your cognition worse, so that blocking it makes your cognition better again?) It&#8217;s a 5-HT1B partial agonist! (what is 5-HT1B? Apparently a <A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5919989/">useful potential depression target</A>, according to a half-Japanese, half-Scandinavian team, who report no conflict of interest even though vortioxetine is being sold by a consortium of a Japanese pharma company and a Scandinavian pharma company). It&#8217;s a 5-HT1D antagonist! (really? There are four different kinds of 5-HT1 receptor? Are you sure you&#8217;re not just making things up now?)</p>
<p>If we take all of this seriously, vortioxetine is an SSRI with faster mechanism of action, fewer sexual side effects, additional anti-anxiety effect, additional anti-nausea effect, plus it gives you better cognition (technically &#8220;relieves the cognitive symptoms of depression&#8221;). Is any of this at all true?</p>
<p><A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4409435/">A meta-analysis of 12 studies</A> finds vortioxetine has a statistically significant but pathetic effect size of 0.2 against depression, which is about average for antidepressants. In a few head-to-head comparisons with SNRIs (similar to SSRIs), vortioxetine treats depression about equally well. Patients are more likely to stop the SNRIs because of side effects than to stop the vortioxetine, but SNRIs probably have more side effects than SSRIs, so unclear if vortioxetine is better than those. <A HREF="https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.jad.2017.11.056">Wagner et al</A> are able to find a study comparing vortioxetine to the SSRI Paxil; they work about equally well.</p>
<p>What about the other claims? Weirdly, vortioxetine patients have <A HREF="https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.jad.2017.11.056">more nausea and vomiting</A> than venlafaxine patients, although it&#8217;s not significant. <A HREF="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24750573.2017.1338823#">Other studies</A> confirm nausea is a pretty serious vortioxetine side effect. I have no explanation for this. Antagonizing 5-HT3 receptors does one thing &#8211; treats nausea and vomiting! &#8211; and vortioxetine definitely does this. It must be hitting some other unknown receptor really hard, so hard that the 5-HT3 antagonism doesn&#8217;t counterbalance it. Either that, or it&#8217;s the thing where God hates antidepressants again.</p>
<p>What about sexual dysfunction? <A HREF="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1743609515344192">Jacobsen et al</A> find that patients have slightly (but statistically significantly) less sexual dysfunction on vortioxetine than on escitalopram. But the study was done by Takeda, and the difference is so slight (a change of 8.8 points on a 60 point scale, vs. a change of 6.6 points) that it&#8217;s hard to take it very seriously. </p>
<p>What about cognition? I was sure this was fake, but it seems to have more evidence behind it than anything else. <A HREF="https://www.thecarlatreport.com/the-carlat-psychiatry-report/trintellix-and-cognition-a-closer-look/">Carlat Report</A> (paywalled) thinks it might be legit, based on a series of (Takeda-sponsored) studies of performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test. People on vortioxetine consistently did better on this test than people on placebo or duloxetine. And it wasn&#8217;t just that being not-depressed helps you try harder; they did some complicated statistics and found that vortioxetine&#8217;s test-score-improving effect was independent of its antidepressant effect (and seems to work at lower doses). What&#8217;s the catch? The improvement was pretty minimal, and only shows up on this one test &#8211; various other cognitive tests are unaffected. So it&#8217;s probably doing <i>something</i> measurable, but it&#8217;s not going to give you a leg up on the SAT. The FDA seriously considered approving it as indicated for helping cognition, but eventually decided against it on the grounds that if they approved it, people would think it was useful in real life, whereas all we know is that it&#8217;s useful on this one kind of hokey test. Still, that&#8217;s one hokey test more than vilazodone was ever able to show for itself.</p>
<p>In summary, vortioxetine probably treats depression about as well as any other antidepressant, but makes you slightly more nauseous, may (if you <i>really</i> trust pharma company studies) give you slightly fewer sexual side effects, and may improve your performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test. It also costs $375 a month (Lexapro still costs $7). If you want to pay $368 extra to be a little more nauseous and substitute digits for symbols a little faster, this is definitely the drug for you.</p>
<p><b>VI.</b></p>
<p>In conclusion, big pharma spent about ten years seeing if combining 5-HT1A partial agonism with SSRI antidepressants led to any benefits. In the end, it didn&#8217;t, unless you count benefits to big pharma&#8217;s bottom line.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a little baffled, because pharma companies generally don&#8217;t waste money researching drugs unless they have very good theoretical reasons to think they&#8217;ll work. But I can&#8217;t make heads or tails of the theoretical case for 5-HT1A partial agonists for depression. </p>
<p>For one thing, there&#8217;s a pretty strong argument that buspirone exerts its effects via dopamine rather than serotonin &#8211; a case that it seems like nobody, including the pharma companies, is even slightly aware of. If this were true, the whole project would have been doomed from the beginning. What happened here?</p>
<p>For another, I still don&#8217;t get the supposed model for how buspirone even <i>could</i> exert its effects through 5-HT1A. Does it increase or decrease serotonergic transmission? Does it desensitize presynaptic autoreceptors the same way SSRIs do, or do something else? I can&#8217;t figure out a combination of answers to this question that are consistent with each other and with the known effects of these drugs. Is there one?</p>
<p>For another, the case seems to have been premised on the idea that buspirone (a presynaptic 5-HT1A agonist) would work the same as pindolol (a presynaptic 5-HT1A antagonist), even after studies showed that it didn&#8217;t. And then it combined that with an assumption that it was better to spend hundreds of millions of dollars discovering a drug that combined SSRI and buspirone-like effects, rather than just giving someone a pill of SSRI powder mixed with buspirone powder. Why?</p>
<p>I would be grateful if some friendly pharmacologist reading this were to comment with their take on these questions. This is supposed to be my area of expertise, and I have to admit I am stumped.</p>

				<p>This is the biweek-ly visible open thread (there are also hidden open threads twice a week you can reach through the Open Thread tab on the top of the page). Post about anything you want, but please try to avoid hot-button political and social topics. You can also talk at the <b><A HREF="https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/">SSC subreddit</A></b> &#8211; and also check out the <b><A HREF="https://linktr.ee/sscpodcast">SSC Podcast</A></b>.  Also:</p>
<p><b>1.</b> Comment of the week: superkamiokande from the subreddit <A HREF="https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/h7egp3/wordy_wernickes/fumiaix/">explains the structural and computational differences between Wernicke&#8217;s and Broca&#8217;s areas</A>.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> There&#8217;s another SSC virtual meetup next week, guest speaker Robin Hanson. More information <A HREF="https://cephalopods.blog/2020/04/12/ssc-lesswrong-meetup/">here</A>.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> As many areas reopen, local groups will have to decide whether or not to restart in-person meetups. I can&#8217;t speak to other countries that may have things more under control, but in the US context, I am against this. Just because it&#8217;s legal to hold medium-sized gatherings now doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a good idea. I would feel really bad if anyone became sick or spread the pandemic because of my blog. I don&#8217;t control local groups, and they can do what they want, but I won&#8217;t be advertising meetups on the blogroll until I feel like they&#8217;re safe. Exceptions for East Asia, New Zealand, and anyone else who can convince me that their country is in the clear.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> Some people have noticed that <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/">my toxoplasma post</A> seems disconfirmed by recent protests, which reached national scale even though the incident was very clear-cut and uncontroversial. I agree this is some negative evidence. The toxoplasma model was meant to be a tendency, not a 100% claim about things always work. Certainly it is still mysterious in general why some outrageous incidents spark protests and other near-identical ones don&#8217;t. I think it&#8217;s relevant that everyone is in a bad place right now because of coronavirus (remember, just two months ago Marginal Revolution posted <A HREF="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/04/when-will-the-riots-begin.html">When Will The Riots Begin?</A>), and that 2020 is the peak of Turchin&#8217;s fifty-year <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/09/02/book-review-ages-of-discord/">cycle of conflict</A>.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> Speaking of protests, the open threads have been getting pretty intense lately. I realize some awful stuff has been going on, and emotions are really high, but I want everyone to take a deep breath and try to calm down a little bit before saying anything you&#8217;ll regret later. I will be enforcing the usually-poorly-enforced ban on culture war topics in this thread with unrecorded deletions. I may or may not suspend the next one or two hidden threads to give everyone a chance to calm down. I hope everybody is staying safe and sane during these difficult times.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> If you haven&#8217;t already taken last week&#8217;s nootropics survey, and you are an experienced user of nootropics, you can <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/07/take-the-new-nootropics-survey/">take it now</A>.</p>

				<p>There are two major brain areas involved in language. To oversimplify, Wernicke&#8217;s area in the superior temporal gyrus handles meaning; Broca&#8217;s area in the inferior frontal gyrus handles structure and flow. </p>
<p>If a stroke or other brain injury damages Broca&#8217;s area but leaves Wernicke&#8217;s area intact, you get language which is meaningful, but not very structured or fluid. You sound like a caveman: &#8220;Want food!&#8221;</p>
<p>If it damages Wernicke&#8217;s area but leaves Broca&#8217;s area intact, you get speech which has normal structure and flow, but is meaningless. I&#8217;d read about this pattern in books, but I still wasn&#8217;t prepared the first time I saw a video of a Wernicke&#8217;s aphasia patient (<A HREF="https://tactustherapy.com/what-is-fluent-aphasia-video/">source</A>):</p>
<p><center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3oef68YabD0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p>
<p>During yesterday&#8217;s discussion of GPT-3, a commenter mentioned how <i>alien</i> it felt to watch something use language perfectly without quite making sense. I agree it&#8217;s eerie, but it isn&#8217;t some kind of inhuman robot weirdness. Any one of us is a railroad-spike-through-the-head away from doing the same.</p>
<p>Does this teach us anything useful about GPT-3 or neural networks? I lean towards no. GPT-3 already makes more sense than a Wernicke&#8217;s aphasiac. Whatever it&#8217;s doing is on a higher level than the Broca&#8217;s/Wernicke&#8217;s dichotomy. Still, it would be interesting to learn what kind of computational considerations caused the split, and whether there&#8217;s any microstructural difference in the areas that reflects it. I don&#8217;t know enough neuroscience to have an educated opinion on this.</p>

				<p><b>I.</b></p>
<p>I would be failing my brand if I didn&#8217;t write something about GPT-3, but I&#8217;m not an expert and discussion is still in its early stages. Consider this a summary of some of the interesting questions I&#8217;ve heard posed elsewhere, especially comments by <A HREF="https://www.gwern.net/newsletter/2020/05">gwern</A> and <A HREF="https://nostalgebraist.tumblr.com/post/619672884731904000/gpt-3-and-scaling-trends">nostalgebraist</A>. Both of them are smart people who I broadly trust on AI issues, and both have done great work with GPT-2. Gwern has gotten it to <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/14/gwerns-ai-generated-poetry/">write poetry</A>, <A HREF="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-2-music">compose music</A>, and even <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/01/06/a-very-unlikely-chess-game/">sort of play some chess</A>; nostalgebraist has created <A HREF="https://nostalgebraist-autoresponder.tumblr.com/">nostalgebraist-autoresponder</A> (a Tumblr written by GPT-2 trained on nostalgebraist&#8217;s own Tumblr output). Both of them disagree pretty strongly on the implications of GPT-3. I don&#8217;t know enough to resolve that disagreement, so this will be a kind of incoherent post, and hopefully stimulate some more productive comments. So:</p>
<p>OpenAI has released a new paper, <A HREF="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf">Language Models Are Few-Shot Learners</A>, introducing GPT-3, the successor to the wildly-successful language-processing AI GPT-2.</p>
<p>GPT-3 doesn&#8217;t have any revolutionary new advances over its predecessor. It&#8217;s just <i>much</i> bigger. GPT-2 had 1.5 billion parameters. GPT-3 has 175 billion. The researchers involved are very open about how it&#8217;s the same thing but bigger. Their research goal was to test how GPT-like neural networks scale. </p>
<p>Before we get into the weeds, let&#8217;s get a quick gestalt impression of how GPT-3 does compared to GPT-2.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a sample of GPT-2 trying to write an article:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>PROMPT: MILEY CYRUS WAS CAUGHT SHOPLIFTING FROM ABERCROMBIE AND FITCH ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD TODAY</b></p>
<p>The 19-year-old singer was caught on camera being escorted out of the store by security guards.</p>
<p>The singer was wearing a black hoodie with the label ‘Blurred Lines’ on the front and ‘Fashion Police’ on the back</p>
<p>The singer was also wearing a pair of black-rimmed glasses, a black jacket, black jeans and black sandals.</p>
<p>She was carrying a pair of black and white striped gloves and a small black bag.</p></blockquote>
<p>And here&#8217;s GPT-3 at the same task:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>PROMPT: UNITED METHODISTS AGREE TO HISTORIC SPLIT &#8211; THOSE WHO OPPOSE GAY MARRIAGE WILL FORM THEIR OWN DENOMINATION</b></p>
<p>After two days of intense debate, the United Methodist Church has agreed to a historic split &#8211; one that is expected to end in the creation of a new denomination, one that will be &#8220;theologically and socially conservative,&#8221; according to the Washington Post. The majority of delegates attending the church&#8217;s annual General Conference in May voted to strengthen a ban on the ordination of LGBTQ clergy and to write new rules that will &#8220;discipline&#8221; clergy who officiate at same-sex weddings. But those who opposed these measures have a new plan: They say they will form a separate denomination by 2020, calling their church the Christian Methodist denomination.</p>
<p>The Post notes that the denomination, which claims 12.5 million members, was in the early 20th century the &#8220;largest Protestant denomination in the US&#8221;, but that it has been shrinking in recent decades. The new split will be the second in the church&#8217;s history. The first occurred in 1968, when roughly 10% of the denomination left to form the Evangelical United Brethren Church. The Post notes that the proposed split &#8220;comes at a critical time for the church, which has been losing members for years,&#8221; which has been &#8220;pushed toward the brink of a schism over the role of LGBTQ people in the church.&#8221; Gay marriage is not the only issue that has divided the church. In 2016, the denomination was split over ordination of transgender clergy, with the North Pacific regional conference voting to ban them from serving as clergy, and the South Pacific regional conference voting to allow them.</p></blockquote>
<p>In case you&#8217;re wondering, no, the Methodist Church did not really split from the Evangelical United Brethren Church in 1968, it <i>merged with it</i> in that year. GPT-3 is doing what I used to do on essay questions &#8211; throw out a bunch of half-remembered names and dates and hope nobody looks too closely at the exact relations.</p>
<p>These kinds of comparisons are inherently fuzzy, since both GPTs have produced a lot of material and it&#8217;s easy to cheat by taking better or worse samples of one or the other. You can see more GPT-2 samples <A HREF="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">here</A> and more GPT-3 samples <A HREF="https://read-the-samples.netlify.app/">here</A></p>
<p>Or compare some of GPT-2&#8217;s poetry:</p>
<blockquote><p>The gods are they who came to earth<br />
And set the seas ablaze with gold.<br />
There is a breeze upon the sea,<br />
A sea of summer in its folds,<br />
A salt, enchanted breeze that mocks<br />
The scents of life, from far away<br />
Comes slumbrous, sad, and quaint, and quaint.<br />
The mother of the gods, that day,<br />
With mortal feet and sweet voice speaks,<br />
And smiles, and speaks to men:  &#8220;My Sweet,<br />
I shall not weary of thy pain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;Let me drink of the wine of pain<br />
And think upon the agonies of hope,<br />
And of the blessed Giver of all good things;<br />
For, man for man, mine is the deepest love<br />
That sorrow takes upon the humblest soul;<br />
But who hath learned how sorrow turns to gall<br />
The places where my feet have trod before.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;to some of GPT-3&#8217;s:</p>
<blockquote><p>I must have shadows on the way<br />
If I am to walk I must have<br />
Each step taken slowly and alone<br />
To have it ready made</p>
<p>And I must think in lines of grey<br />
Must have dim thoughts to be my guide<br />
Must look on blue and green<br />
And never let my eye forget<br />
That color is my friend<br />
And purple must surround me too</p>
<p>The yellow of the sun is more more<br />
Intusive than the bluish snow<br />
That falls on all of us. I must have<br />
Grey thoughts and blue thoughts walk with me<br />
If I am to go away at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ignore the style differences &#8211; the GPT-2 instance was trained on 18th-century verse, GPT-3 on Wallace Stevens. I notice that the first poem, while flowery, is kind of incoherent. The second has more of a structure and a theme that it maintains throughout. I&#8217;m not sure it really symbolizes anything interesting, but I&#8217;ve never been sure of that with real Wallace Stevens either, so good work.</p>
<p>(you can read more GPT-2 poetry <A HREF="https://www.gwern.net/docs/ai/poetry/2019-03-06-gpt2-poetry-prefix-1000samples.txt">here</A>. There&#8217;s not much more public GPT-3 poetry &#8211; you can read one or two more samples on the paper linked above).</p>
<p>Enough writing. What about math? Last year, I posted the following excerpt from GPT-2:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>PROMPT: MY 10 FAVORITE ANIMALS ARE:</b></p>
<p>My ten favorite animals are:<br />
1. Zebras with a white scar on the back<br />
2. Insiduous spiders and octopus<br />
3. Frog with large leaves, hopefully black<br />
4. Cockatiel with scales<br />
5. Razorbill with wings hanging about 4 inches from one’s face and a heart tattoo on a frog<br />
3. Cockatric interlocking tetrabods that can be blind, cut, and eaten raw:<br />
4. Black and white desert crocodiles living in sunlight<br />
5. Zebra and many other pea bugs</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the obvious flaws in this piece, I was impressed. GPT-2 was clearly trying to make a numbered list, and almost kind of getting it right! It counted to 4 successfully! Remember, this is a text prediction engine that didn&#8217;t necessarily need to have any concept of numbers. But it still kind of counted to 4! I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine you prompted the model with “What is one plus one?” I actually don’t know how it would do on this problem. I’m guessing it would answer “two”, just because the question probably appeared a bunch of times in its training data.</p>
<p>Now imagine you prompted it with “What is four thousand and eight plus two thousand and six?” or some other long problem that probably didn’t occur exactly in its training data. I predict it would fail, because this model can’t count past five without making mistakes. But I imagine a very similar program, given a thousand times more training data and computational resources, would succeed. It would notice a pattern in sentences including the word “plus” or otherwise describing sums of numbers, it would figure out that pattern, and it would end up able to do simple math. I don’t think this is too much of a stretch given that GPT-2 learned to count to five and acronymize words and so on.</p></blockquote>
<p>I said &#8220;a very similar program, given a thousand times more training data and computational resources, would succeed [at adding four digit numbers]&#8221;. Well, GPT-3 is a very similar program with a hundred times more computational resources, and&#8230;it can add four-digit numbers! At least sometimes, which is better than GPT-2&#8217;s &#8220;none of the time&#8221;.</p>
<p><b>II.</b></p>
<p>In fact, let&#8217;s take a closer look at GPT-3&#8217;s math performance.</p>
<p><center><IMG SRC="https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/gpt3_math.png"></center></p>
<p>The 1.3 billion parameter model, equivalent to GPT-2, could get two-digit addition problems right less than 5% of the time &#8211; little better than chance. But for whatever reason, once the model hit 13 billion parameters, its addition abilities improved to 60% &#8211; the equivalent of a D student. At 175 billion parameters, it gets an A+.</p>
<p>What does it mean for an AI to be able to do addition, but only inconsistently? For four digit numbers, but not five digit numbers? Doesn&#8217;t it either understand addition, or not?</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s cheating? Maybe there were so many addition problems in its dataset that it just memorized all of them? I don&#8217;t think this is the answer. There are 100 million possible 4-digit addition problems; seems unlikely that GPT-3 saw that many of them. Also, if it was memorizing its training data, it should have gotten all 100 possible two-digit multiplication problems, but it only has about a 25% success rate on those. So it can&#8217;t be using a lookup table.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s having trouble <i>locating</i> addition rather than <i>doing</i> addition? (thanks to <A HREF="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZHrpjDc3CepSeeBuE/gpt-3-a-disappointing-paper#1_2__On__few_shot_learning_">nostalgebraist</A> for this framing). This sort of seems like the lesson of Table 3.9:</p>
<p><center><IMG SRC="https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/gpt3_mathshots.png"></center></p>
<p>&#8220;Zero-shot&#8221; means you just type in &#8220;20 + 20 = ?&#8221;. &#8220;One-shot&#8221; means you give it an example first: &#8220;10 + 10 = 20. 20 + 20 = ?&#8221; &#8220;Few-shot&#8221; means you give it as many examples as it can take. Even the largest and best model only does mediocre on the zero-shot task, but it does better on the one-shot and best on the few-shot. So it seems like if you remind it what addition is a couple of times before solving an addition problem, it does better. This suggests that there is a working model of addition somewhere within the bowels of this 175 billion parameter monster, but it has a hard time drawing it out for any particular task. You need to tell it &#8220;addition&#8221; &#8220;we&#8217;re doing addition&#8221; &#8220;come on now, do some addition!&#8221; up to fifty times before it will actually deploy its addition model for these problems, instead of some other model. Maybe if you did this five hundred or five thousand times, it would excel at the problems it can&#8217;t do now, like adding five digit numbers. But why should this be so hard? The plus sign almost always means addition. &#8220;20 + 20 = ?&#8221; is not some inscrutable hieroglyphic text. It basically always means the same thing. Shouldn&#8217;t this be easy?</p>
<p>When I prompt GPT-2 with addition problems, the most common failure mode is getting an answer that isn&#8217;t a number. Often it&#8217;s a few paragraphs of text that look like they came from a math textbook. It feels like it&#8217;s been able to locate the problem as far as &#8220;you want the kind of thing in math textbooks&#8221;, but not as far as &#8220;you want the answer to the exact math problem you are giving me&#8221;. This is a surprising issue to have, but so far AIs have been nothing if not surprising. Imagine telling Marvin Minsky or someone that an AI smart enough to write decent poetry would not necessarily be smart enough to know that, when asked &#8220;325 + 504&#8221;, we wanted a numerical response!</p>
<p>Or maybe that&#8217;s not it. Maybe it has trouble getting math problems right consistently for the same reason <i>I</i> have trouble with this. In fact, GPT-3&#8217;s performance is very similar to mine. I can also add two digit numbers in my head with near-100% accuracy, get worse as we go to three digit numbers, and make no guarantees at all about four-digit. I also find multiplying two-digit numbers in my head much harder than adding those same numbers. What&#8217;s my excuse? Do I understand addition, or not? I used to assume my problems came from limited short-term memory, or from neural noise. But GPT-3 shouldn&#8217;t have either of those issues. Should I feel a deep kinship with GPT-3? Are we both <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/31/the-parable-of-the-talents/">minds heavily optimized for writing</A>, forced by a cruel world to sometimes do math problems? I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>[EDIT: an alert reader points out that when GPT-3 fails at addition problems, it fails in human-like ways &#8211; for example, forgetting to carry a 1.]</p>
<p><b>III.</b></p>
<p>GPT-3 is, fundamentally, an attempt to investigate scaling laws in neural networks. That is, if you start with a good neural network, and make it ten times bigger, does it get smarter? How much smarter? Ten times smarter? Can you keep doing this forever until it&#8217;s infinitely smart or you run out of computers, whichever comes first?</p>
<p><center><IMG SRC="https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/gpt3_aggregate.png"></center></p>
<p>So far the scaling looks logarithmic &#8211; a consistent multiplication of parameter number produces a consistent gain on the benchmarks.</p>
<p>Does that mean it really is all about model size? Should something even bigger than GPT-3 be better still, until eventually we have things that can do all of this stuff arbitrarily well without any new advances?</p>
<p>This is where my sources diverge. Gwern says yes, probably, and points to years of falsified predictions where people said that scaling might have worked so far, but definitely wouldn&#8217;t work past <i>this</i> point.  Nostalgebraist says maybe not, and points to decreasing returns of GPT-3&#8217;s extra power on certain benchmarks (see Appendix H) and to <A HREF="https://nostalgebraist.tumblr.com/post/619511470655504384/the-gpt-3-paper-cites-another-recent-jan-2020">this OpenAI paper</A>, which he interprets as showing that scaling should break down somewhere around or just slightly past where GPT-3 is. If he&#8217;s right, GPT-3 might be around the best that you can do just by making GPT-like things bigger and bigger. He also points out that although GPT-3 is impressive as a general-purpose reasoner that has taught itself things without being specifically optimized to learn them, it&#8217;s often worse than task-specifically-trained AIs at various specific language tasks, so we shouldn&#8217;t get too excited about it being close to superintelligence or anything. I guess in retrospect this is obvious &#8211; it&#8217;s cool that it learned how to add four-digit numbers, but calculators have been around a long time and can add much longer numbers than that.</p>
<p>If the scaling laws don&#8217;t break down, what then?</p>
<p>GPT-3 is very big, but it&#8217;s not pushing the limits of how big an AI it&#8217;s possible to make. If someone rich and important like Google wanted to make a much bigger GPT, they could do it.</p>

<p>Does &#8220;terrifying&#8221; sound weirdly alarmist here? I think the argument is something like this. In February, we watched as the number of US coronavirus cases went from 10ish to 50ish to 100ish over the space of a few weeks. We didn&#8217;t panic, because 100ish was still a very low number of coronavirus cases. In retrospect, we should have panicked, because the number was constantly increasing, showed no signs of stopping, and simple linear extrapolation suggested it would be somewhere scary very soon. After the number of coronavirus cases crossed 100,000 and 1,000,000 at exactly the time we could have predicted from the original curves, we all told ourselves we <i>definitely</i> wouldn&#8217;t be making that exact same mistake again.</p>
<p><center><IMG SRC="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/scientific_briefing_2x.png"></center></p>
<p>It&#8217;s always possible that the next AI will be the one where the scaling curves break and it stops being easy to make AIs smarter just by giving them more computers. But unless something surprising like that saves us, we should assume GPT-like things will become much more powerful very quickly.</p>
<p>What would much more powerful GPT-like things look like? They can already write some forms of text at near-human level (in the paper above, the researchers asked humans to identify whether a given news article had been written by a human reporter or GPT-3; the humans got it right 52% of the time)</p>
<p><center><IMG SRC="https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/gpt3_accuracy.png"></center></p>
<p>So one very conservative assumption would be that a smarter GPT would do better at various arcane language benchmarks, but otherwise not be much more interesting &#8211; once it can write text at a human level, that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>Could it do more radical things like write proofs or generate scientific advances? After all, if you feed it thousands of proofs, and then prompt it with a theorem to be proven, that&#8217;s a text prediction task. If you feed it physics textbooks, and prompt it with &#8220;and the Theory of Everything is&#8230;&#8221;, that&#8217;s also a text prediction task. I realize these are wild conjectures, but the last time I made a wild conjecture, it was &#8220;maybe you can learn addition, because that&#8217;s a text prediction task&#8221; and that one came true within two years. But my guess is still that this won&#8217;t happen in a meaningful way anytime soon. GPT-3 is much better at writing coherent-sounding text than it is at any kind of logical reasoning; remember it still can&#8217;t add 5-digit numbers very well, get its Methodist history right, or consistently figure out that a plus sign means &#8220;add things&#8221;. Yes, it can do simple addition, but it has to use supercomputer-level resources to do so &#8211; it&#8217;s so inefficient that it&#8217;s hard to imagine even very large scaling getting it anywhere useful. At most, maybe a high-level GPT could write a plausible-sounding Theory Of Everything that uses physics terms in a vaguely coherent way, but that falls apart when a real physicist examines it.</p>
<p>Probably we can be pretty sure it won&#8217;t take over the world? I have a hard time figuring out how to turn world conquest into a text prediction task. It could probably imitate a human writing a plausible-sounding <i>plan</i> to take over the world, but it couldn&#8217;t implement such a plan (and would have no desire to do so).</p>
<p>For me the scary part isn&#8217;t the much larger GPT we&#8217;ll probably have in a few years. It&#8217;s the discovery that even very complicated AIs get smarter as they get bigger. If someone ever invented an AI that did do more than text prediction, it would have a pretty fast takeoff, going from toy to superintelligence in just a few years.</p>
<p>Speaking of which &#8211; can anything based on GPT-like principles ever produce superintelligent output? How would this happen? If it&#8217;s trying to mimic what a human can write, then no matter how intelligent it is &#8220;under the hood&#8221;, all that intelligence will only get applied to becoming better and better at predicting what kind of dumb stuff a normal-intelligence human would say. In a sense, solving the Theory of Everything would be a failure at its primary task. No human writer would end the sentence &#8220;the Theory of Everything is&#8230;&#8221; with anything other than &#8220;currently unknown and very hard to figure out&#8221;.</p>
<p>But if our own brains are also prediction engines, how do <i>we</i> ever create things smarter and better than the ones we grew up with? I can imagine scientific theories being part of our predictive model rather than an output of it &#8211; we use the theory of gravity to predict how things will fall. But what about new forms of art? What about thoughts that have never been thought before? </p>
<p>And how many parameters does the adult human brain have? The responsible answer is that brain function doesn&#8217;t map perfectly to neural net function, and even if it did we would have no idea how to even begin to make this calculation. The irresponsible answer is <A HREF="https://blog.piekniewski.info/2018/08/28/fun-numbers-about-the-brain/">a hundred trillion</A>. That&#8217;s a big number. But at the current rate of GPT progress, a GPT will have that same number of parameters somewhere between GPT-4 and GPT-5. Given the speed at which OpenAI works, that should happen about two years from now.</p>
<p>I am definitely not predicting that a GPT with enough parameters will be able to do everything a human does. But I&#8217;m really interested to see what it <i>can</i> do. And we&#8217;ll find out soon.</p>

				<p><b>I.</b></p>
<p>I hate paywalls on articles. Absolutely hate them.</p>
<p>A standard pro-business argument: businesses can either make your life better (by providing deals you like) or keep your life the same (by providing deals you don&#8217;t like, which you don&#8217;t take). They can&#8217;t really make your life worse. There are some exceptions, like if they outcompete and destroy another business you liked better, or if they have some kind of externalities, or if they lobby the government to do something bad. But in general, if you&#8217;re angry at a business, you need to explain how one of these unusual conditions applies. Otherwise they&#8217;re just &#8220;helping you less than you wish they did&#8221;, not hurting you.</p>
<p>And so the standard justification for paywalls. Journalists are providing you a deal: you may read their articles in exchange for money. You are not entitled to their product without paying them money. They need to earn a living just like everyone else. So you can either accept their deal &#8211; pay money for the articles &#8211; or refuse their deal &#8211; and so be left no worse off than if they didn&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>But I notice feeling like this isn&#8217;t true. I think I would be happier in a world where major newspapers ceased to exist, compared to the world where they exist but their articles are paywalled. Take a second and check if you feel the same way. If so, what could be going on?</p>
<p><u>First</u>, paywalled newspapers sometimes use a clickbait model, where they start by making you curious what&#8217;s in the article, then charge you to find out. </p>
<p>Here are some articles I&#8217;ve seen advertised recently (not all on paywalled sources): &#8220;Why Trump&#8217;s Fight With Obama Might Backfire&#8221;, &#8220;This Tech Guru Has Made A Shocking Prediction For 2020&#8221;, &#8220;Here&#8217;s Why Men are Pointing Loaded Guns At Their Dicks&#8221;. </p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t wake up this morning thinking &#8220;I wonder whether men are pointing loaded guns at their dicks, and, if so, why. I hope some enterprising journalist has investigated this question, and I will be happy to compensate her with money for satisfying this weird curiosity of mine.&#8221; No, instead, I was perfectly and innocently happy not knowing anything about this, <i>right up until I read the name of that article</i> at which point I became consumed with curiosity, ie a feeling  that I will be unhappy until I know the answer. In this particular case it&#8217;s fine, because the offending website (VICE) is unpaywalled. I go there and after reading through nine paragraphs attacking &#8220;MAGA dolts&#8221;, in the tenth paragraph I get the one-sentence answer: there&#8217;s a meme in the gun community that any time someone posts a picture with their gun, amateurs will chime in with condescending advice about how they should be holding it more safely, so some people post pictures of them pointing loaded guns at their dicks in order to piss these people off. I feel completely unenlightened by knowing this. It has not brightened my day. It just removed the temporary itch of curiosity.</p>
<p>Some people critique capitalism by saying it creates new preferences that people have to spend money to satisfy. I haven&#8217;t noticed this being true in general &#8211; I only buy shoes when I need shoes, and I only buy Coke when I want Coke. But it seems absolutely on the mark regarding paywalled journalism. VICE created a new preference for me (the preference to know why some people point loaded guns at their dicks), then satisfied it. Overall I have neither gained nor lost utility. This seems different from providing me with a service.</p>
<p>They have an excuse, which is that this is how they make money. But what&#8217;s Marginal Revolution&#8217;s excuse? I saw this link in an MR links roundup. It was posted as &#8220;5. Why men are pointing loaded guns at their dicks.&#8221; So obviously I clicked on it, and here we are. But what is MR&#8217;s interest in making me click on a VICE article and read through nine paragraphs about &#8220;MAGA dolts&#8221;?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t really blame them, because I did the same thing for years. I posted links posts, I framed the links in deliberately provocative ways, and then I felt good about myself when my stats page recorded that thousands of people had clicked on them. Sometimes I would write the whole thing out &#8211; &#8220;Here&#8217;s an article about men pointing loaded guns at their dicks &#8211; it&#8217;s because they want to criticize what they perceive as an excessive and condescending emphasis on trigger safety in gun culture&#8221; &#8211; and then nobody would click on it, and I would interpret that as a sign that I had failed in some way. I was an idiot, I apologize to all of you, and I have stopped doing that. I urge other bloggers to do the same &#8211; we gain no extra money, nor power, nor readership by being running-dogs for VICE&#8217;s weird ploy to trick people into reading its stupid articles. But as long as bloggers, Facebookers, tweeters, etc aren&#8217;t following good Internet hygiene, the very existence of paywalled sources will continue to be a net negative for the average Internet user.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just about obvious clickbait like men pointing guns at their dicks. &#8220;Why Trump&#8217;s Fight With Obama Might Backfire&#8221; feels exactly the same to me. I don&#8217;t want to know more ephemeral garbage about Trump which may or may not affect his polls 0.5% for a week before they return to baseline. I don&#8217;t want to get more and more outraged until my ability to relate to my fellow human beings is shaped entirely by whether they&#8217;re a &#8220;MAGA dolt&#8221; or not. And yet I find myself curious what&#8217;s in the article!</p>
<p>(Trump&#8217;s fight with Obama might backfire because independents like Obama more than Trump, and the tech guru&#8217;s 2020 prediction was that Trump will lose. You&#8217;re welcome.)</p>
<p><u>Second</u>, paywalled articles become part of the discourse. </p>
<p>Last week&#8217;s Wall Street Journal included an opinion column, Lockdowns Vs. The Vulnerable, arguing that statistics show the coronavirus lockdowns do not really prevent the coronavirus, but do disproportionately affect the most vulnerable people. It&#8217;s already gotten retweeted a few dozen times, including by some bluechecks with tens of thousands of followers. </p>
<p><center></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The only conclusion available now is that the Swedes were right: The lockdowns were not sustainable, writes <a href="https://twitter.com/HolmanJenkins?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@holmanjenkins</a> <a href="https://t.co/WFNEa5ScjV">https://t.co/WFNEa5ScjV</a> via <a href="https://twitter.com/WSJ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WSJ</a></p>

<p> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center></p>
<p>Do you want to figure out exactly what statistics it uses and check whether they <i>really</i> show that lockdowns don&#8217;t prevent coronavirus? Too bad &#8211; the article is paywalled and you cannot read it without paying $19.50/month to the Wall Street Journal. I personally suspect that this article is terribly wrong, possibly to the point of idiocy. But I can neither convince others of this, nor correct my own potentially-false first impression, without paying the Wall Street Journal $19.50 a month. Which I don&#8217;t want to do. Partly because it is bad value, and partly because I don&#8217;t want to reward them for publishing false things.</p>
<p>Newspapers publish articles &#8211; factual and opinionated &#8211; intending them to enter the public square as a topic of discussion. But if the discussions in the public square have an entry fee, the public square becomes smaller and less diverse.</p>
<p>It also becomes more of an echo chamber. Probably conservatives subscribe to the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> and liberals subscribe to the <i>New York Times</i>. So if conservatives post articles from the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, liberals can neither benefit from the true ones and change their own opinions, nor correct the false ones and change conservatives&#8217; opinions. If you can&#8217;t even <i>read</i> the other side&#8217;s arguments, how can you be convinced by them?</p>
<p><u>Third</u>, newspapers make it hard to guess whether you will encounter a paywall or not. Some of them raise a paywall on some kinds of articles but not others. Some of them raise a paywall if you&#8217;re linked in from social media, but not if you&#8217;re linked in from Google (or vice versa). Some of them raise a paywall if it&#8217;s your Xth article per month on a certain computer, but not before.</p>
<p>The end result is you can&#8217;t just learn to avoid the newspapers with paywalls. If you clearly knew which links were paywalled or not, you would just never click on those links, and not waste any time. Since any given newspaper has like a 25 &#8211; 50% chance of being paywalled whenever you read it, you get the variable reinforcement strategy that promotes frustrated addiction. And since at any given moment you are <i>desperate</i> to click on that link and find out Why Some Men Are Pointing Loaded Guns At Their Own Dicks, you will, like a chump, click it anyway, only to howl with rage when the paywall comes up.</p>
<p>This usually isn&#8217;t a deliberate misdeed; newspapers understandably want to give people limited access so they can decide whether or not they want to subscribe. But some forms of this <i>do</i> seem deliberate to me. Like when they let you read the first two paragraphs and get emotionally invested in the story, and then surprise you with a paywall in the third (I think this is why you need nine paragraphs of filler before getting to the one-sentence curiosity-satisfier). Or when they wait five seconds before a paywall message pops up, for the same reason.</p>
<p><u>Fourth</u>, and most important, paywalled newspapers make it hard to search for information on Google. When I was trying to gather statistics on coronavirus to figure out how fast it was spreading, I noticed that the top ten or twenty relevant search results for a lot of coronavirus-related queries were paywalled articles. Because articles will make you wait several paragraphs/seconds before the paywall comes up, I couldn&#8217;t just quickly click on something, see if it had a paywall or not, and then move on to the next one. Instead, a search that would have taken me seconds if all paywalled sources ceased to exist ended up taking me several frustrating minutes.</p>
<p><b>II.</b></p>
<p>There are some simple steps we can take to fix this.</p>
<p>First, search engines should give users an option to hide paywalled articles from results. I realize how big a shitstorm this will cause, and I plan to enjoy every second of it. If they can&#8217;t make this happen for some reason, they should at least display a big red $$$ sign in front of paywalled articles, so users know which links will give them information before they waste a click on them. If Google refuses to do this, Bing should do it to get a leg up on Google. If both of them refuse, DuckDuckGo. If all three of them refuse, sounds like they&#8217;re providing an opening for some lucky entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Second, browser or browser-extension designers should figure out some way to automatically get links to display whether they&#8217;re paywalled or not. Maybe something like this already exists, but I can&#8217;t find it.</p>
<p>Third, bloggers (and social media users) should stop deliberately frustrating their readers. Stop posting tantalizing links like &#8220;Why Men Are Pointing Loaded Guns At Their Dicks&#8221; without further explanation! If you find the dick-gun phenomenon interesting, post the link plus a one-sentence summary. If someone wants more than the one-sentence summary, they can click the link, but I&#8217;ve done A/B testing on this and <i>it never happens</i>.</p>
<p>Fourth, bloggers (and social media users) should preferentially link non-paywalled sites. I realize this is not always possible, but most major stories are important enough that at least one non-paywalled outlet will be covering them.</p>
<p>Fifth, until the browser extension comes through, bloggers (and social media users) who do need to link a paywalled site should let readers know it&#8217;s paywalled. For example, <A HREF="https://www.wsj.com/articles/lockdowns-vs-the-vulnerable-11590791538?mod=hp_opin_pos_3">Lockdowns Vs.

				<p><b>I.</b></p>
<p>Julian Jaynes&#8217; <i><A HREF="https://amzn.to/2ZZUR1K">The Origin Of Consciousness In The Breakdown Of The Bicameral Mind</A></i> is a brilliant book, with only two minor flaws. First, that it purports to explains the origin of consciousness. And second, that it posits a breakdown of the bicameral mind. I think it&#8217;s possible to route around these flaws while keeping the thesis otherwise intact. So I&#8217;m going to start by reviewing a slightly different book, the one Jaynes should have written. Then I&#8217;ll talk about the more dubious one he actually wrote.</p>
<p>My hypothetical Jaynes 2.0 is a book about theory-of-mind. Theory-of-mind is our intuitive model of how the mind works. It has no relation to intellectual theories about how the mind is made of cognitive algorithms or instantiated on neurons in the brain. Every schoolchild has theory-of-mind. It goes like this: <i>the mind is an imaginary space containing things like thoughts, emotions, and desires. I have mine and you have yours. I can see what&#8217;s inside my mind, but not what&#8217;s inside your mind, and vice versa. I mostly choose the things that are in my mind at any given time: I will thoughts to happen, and they happen; I will myself to make a decision, and it gets made. This needs a resource called willpower; if I don&#8217;t have enough willpower, sometimes the things that happen in my mind aren&#8217;t the ones I want. When important things happen, sometimes my mind gets strong emotions; this is natural, but I need to use lots of willpower to make sure I don&#8217;t get overwhelmed by them and make bad decisions.</i></p>
<p>All this seems so obvious that it sounds like common sense rather than theory. But it has to be learned. Very young children don&#8217;t start out with theory of mind. They can&#8217;t separate themselves from their emotions; it&#8217;s not natural for them to say &#8220;I&#8217;m really angry now, but that&#8217;s just a thing I&#8217;m feeling, I don&#8217;t actually hate you&#8221;. It&#8217;s not even clear to them that people&#8217;s minds contain different things; children are <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally%E2%80%93Anne_test">famously unable</A> to figure out that a playmate who has different evidence than they do may draw different conclusions. </p>
<p>And the learning isn&#8217;t just a process of passively sitting back observing your own mind until you figure out how it works. You learn it from your parents. Parents are always telling their kids that &#8220;I think this&#8221; and &#8220;What do you think?&#8221; and &#8220;You look sad&#8221; and &#8220;It makes me feel sad when you do that&#8221;. Eventually it all sinks in. Kids learn their parent&#8217;s theory-of-mind the same way they learn their parents&#8217; language or religion.</p>
<p>When in human history did theory-of-mind first arise? It couldn&#8217;t have been a single invention &#8211; more like a gradual process of refinement. &#8220;The unconscious&#8221; only really entered our theory-of-mind with Freud. Statements like &#8220;my abuse gave me a lot of baggage that I&#8217;m still working through&#8221; involves a theory-of-mind that would have been incomprehensible a few centuries ago. It&#8217;s like &#8220;I&#8217;m clicking on an icon with my mouse&#8221; &#8211; every individual word would have made sense, but the gestalt would be nonsensical. </p>
<p>Still, everyone always assumes that the absolute basics &#8211; mind as a metaphorical space containing beliefs and emotions, people having thoughts and making decisions &#8211; must go back so far that their origins are lost in the mists of time, attributable only to nameless ape-men. </p>
<p>Julian Jaynes doesn&#8217;t think that. He thinks it comes from the Bronze Age Near East, c. 1500 &#8211; 750 BC.</p>
<p><b>II.</b></p>
<p>Jaynes (writing in the 1970s) was both a psychology professor at Princeton and an expert in ancient languages, so the perfect person to make this case. He reviews various samples of Bronze Age writing from before and after this period, and shows that the early writings have no references to mental processes, and the later ones do. When early writings do have references to mental processes, they occur in parts agreed by scholars to be later interpolations. If, with no knowledge of the language itself, you tried to figure out which parts of a heavily-redacted ancient text were early vs. late by their level of reference to mental processes, you could do a pretty decent job.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t speak fluent Sumerian, so I am forced to take Jaynes&#8217; word for a lot of this. It&#8217;s even worse than that, because Jaynes argues that other translators sometimes err and translate non-mental terms in mental ways. This is an easy mistake for them to make, because most cultures, once they got theory of mind, repurposed existing language to represent it. Jaynes makes a convincing case for why this would happen, and convincingly argues for why his interpretations are truer to the spirit of the text, but it does mean you can&#8217;t double-check his work by reading the works in translation.</p>
<p>Jaynes spends the most time talking about the <i>Iliad</i>, with good reason &#8211; it&#8217;s the longest Bronze Age work we have, and in many ways it&#8217;s a psychodrama, focusing as much on the characters of Achilles, Hector, etc as the plot itself. It came together piecemeal through the efforts of Greek bards between about 1100 and 800 BC, finally reaching a canonical version in the mouth of &#8220;Homer&#8221; around 700 BC &#8211; the period Jaynes says theory of mind was starting to evolve. Jaynes uses it to trace the development process, showing how older sections of the <i>Iliad</i> treat psychology in different ways than newer ones.</p>
<p>So for example, a typical translation might use a phrase like &#8220;Fear filled Agamemnon&#8217;s mind&#8221;. Wrong! There is no word for &#8220;mind&#8221; in the <i>Iliad</i>, except maybe in the very newest interpolations. The words are things like <i>kardia</i>, <i>noos</i>, <i>phrenes</i>, and <i>thumos</i>, which Jaynes translates as heart, vision/perception, belly, and sympathetic nervous system, respectively. He might translate the sentence about Agamemnon to say something like &#8220;Quivering rose in Agamemnon&#8217;s belly&#8221;. It still means the same thing &#8211; Agamemnon is afraid &#8211; but it&#8217;s how you would talk about it if you didn&#8217;t have an idea of &#8220;the mind&#8221; as the place where mental things happened &#8211; you would just notice your belly was quivering more. Later, when the Greeks got theory of mind, they repurposed all these terms. You can still find signs of this today, like how we say &#8220;I believe it in my heart&#8221;. In fact, you can still find this split use of <i>phrenes</i>, which has survived into English both as the phrenic nerve (a nerve in the belly) and schizophrenia (a mental disease). As the transition wore on, people got more and more flowery about the kind of feelings you could have in your belly or your heart or whatever, until finally belly, heart, and all the others merged into a single Mind where all the mental stuff happened together.</p>
<p>The <i>Iliad</i> uses these body parts to describe feelings despite its weak theory of mind. Its solution for describing thoughts and decision-making is more&#8230;unconventional. </p>
<p>Suppose Achilles is overcome with rage and wants to kill Agamemnon. But this would be a terrible [idea]; after [thinking] about it for a while, he [decides] against. If Achilles has no concept of any of the bracketed words, nothing even slightly corresponding to those terms, how does he conceptualize his own actions? Jaynes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The response of Achilles begins in his <i>etor</i>, or what I suggest is a cramp in his guts, where he is in conflict, or put into two parts (<i>mermerizo</i>) whether to obey his <i>thumos</i>, the immediate internal sensations of anger, and kill the king, or not. It is only after this vacillating interval of increasing belly sensations and surges of blood, as Achilles is drawing his mighty sword, that the stress has become sufficient to hallucinate the dreafully gleaming goddess Athene who then takes over control of the action and tells Achilles what to do.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wait, <i>what?</i></p>
<p><b>III.</b></p>
<p>As you go about your day, you hear a voice that tells you what to do, praises you for your successes, criticizes you for your failures, and tells you what decisions to make in difficult situations. Modern theory-of-mind tells you that this is your own voice, thinking thoughts. It says this so consistently and convincingly that we never stop to question whether it might be anything else.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have theory of mind, what do you do with it? Children don&#8217;t have theory of mind, at least not very much of it, and more than half of them <A HREF="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/07/why-do-kids-have-imaginary-friends/594919/">have imaginary friends</A>. Jaynes has done some research on the imaginary friend phenomenon, and argues that a better term would be &#8220;hallucinatory friend&#8221; &#8211; children see and hear these entities vividly. The atheoretical mind is a desperate thing, and will comply with any priors you give it to make sense of its experiences. If that prior is that the voice in your head is a friend &#8211; or god &#8211; it will obediently hallucinate a friend or god for you, and modulate its voice-having accordingly.</p>
<p>I know some very smart and otherwise completely sane evangelical Christians who swear to me that God answers their prayers. They will ask God a question, and they will hear God&#8217;s voice answer it. God&#8217;s voice may not sound <i>exactly</i> like an external voice, and it may give them only the advice they would have given themselves if they&#8217;d thought about it &#8211; but they swear that they are not thinking about it, that their experience is qualitatively different than that. And these are normal people! If you&#8217;re a special person &#8211; a saint or mystic, say &#8211; and you actively court the experience by fasting and praying and generally stressing your body to the limit &#8211; then the voice will be that much louder and more convincing.</p>
<p>There are even whole forms of therapy based on this kind of thing. In <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Family_Systems_Model">Internal Family Systems</A>, the therapist asks the patient to conceptualize some part of their mind (maybe the part that&#8217;s producing a certain symptom) as a person, and to talk to it. I know people who swear that this works. They approach their grief or anger or anxiety, and they get a clear image of what &#8220;he&#8221; or &#8220;she&#8221; looks like, and then &#8220;he&#8221; or &#8220;she&#8221; talks to them. Usually he/she tells them some appropriately psychological sounding thing, like &#8220;Hello, I am your anxiety, and I&#8217;m only inflicting these fears on you because we were abused as a child and I want to make sure nobody ever abuses us like that again&#8221;. Then the patient talks to their anxiety and hopefully strikes a bargain where the patient agrees to take the anxiety&#8217;s perspective into account and the anxiety agrees not to make the patient so anxious all the time. Some people swear by this, say it&#8217;s helped them where nothing else can, and absolutely insist they are having a real dialogue with their anxiety and not just making up both sides of the conversation.</p>
<p>Most of the people who seem to really like IFS have borderline personality disorder. And borderline people are also at the most risk of dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality). Multiple personality has two main risk factors: borderline, and somebody suggesting to you that multiple personality disorder might be a reasonable thing to have. For a while in the 80s, psychiatrists were really into multiple personality and tried diagnosing everyone with it, and sure enough all those people would admit to having multiple personalities and it would be very exciting. Then the APA told the psychiatrists to stop, people stopped talking about multiple personality as much, and now the condition is rarer. </p>
<p>A few years ago, someone rediscovered/invented tulpamancy, the idea of cultivating multiple personalities on purpose because it&#8217;s cool. People who try to do this usually succeed. At least they say they&#8217;ve succeeded, and I believe they think this. I think their internal experience is of talking to a different entity inside of them. Also, I have a friend who writes novels, and one time she created such a detailed mental model of one of her characters that it became an alternate personality, which she still has and considers an important part of her life. She is one of the most practical people I know and not usually prone to flights of fancy.</p>
<p>I also have less practical friends, friends who are into occultism. They tell me they sometimes make contact with spiritual entities. I believe them when they say they have these experiences. I believe them when they say that they were not purposely guiding their Ouija board to say whatever it said. I don&#8217;t have any friends who are cool enough to have gone through the whole procedure for summoning your Holy Guardian Angel, but from what I read, completing the ritual directly does tend to leave you with an angel who hangs around you and gives you advice. I believe the people who say this is their experience of completing the ritual.</p>
<p>I conclude that giving yourself multiple personalities is actually pretty easy under the right circumstances. Those circumstance are a poor theory of mind (I think borderlines are naturally bad at this) and a cultural context in which having a multiple personality is expected.</p>
<p>Jaynes says ancient people met both criteria. They had absolutely no theory of mind, less theory of mind than the tiniest child does today. And their cultural context was absolutely certain that gods existed. Just as we teach our children that the voice in their mind is them thinking to theirselves, so the ancients would teach their children that the voice in their head was a god giving them commands. And the voice would dutifully mold itself to fit the expected role.</p>
<p>Here Jaynes is at his most brilliant, going through ancient texts one by one, noting the total lack of mental imagery, and highlighting the many everyday examples of conversations with gods. Every ancient culture has near-identical concepts of a god who sits inside of you and tells you what to do. The Greeks have their <i>daemons</i>, the Romans their <i>genii</i>, the Egyptians their <i>ka</i> and <i>ba</i>, and the Mesopotamians their <i>iri</i>. The later you go, the more metaphorically people treat these. The earlier you go, the more literal they become. Go early enough, and you find things like the Egyptian <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispute_between_a_man_and_his_Ba">Dispute Between A Man And His Ba</A> which is just a papyrus scroll about a guy arguing loudly with the hallucinatory voice of his guardian spirit, and the guardian spirit&#8217;s hallucinatory voice arguing back, and nobody thinking any of this is weird (people who aren&#8217;t Jaynes would wimp out and say this is &#8220;metaphorical&#8221;). Every ancient text is in complete agreement that everyone in society heard the gods&#8217; voices very often and usually based decisions off of them. Jaynes is just the only guy who takes this seriously.</p>
<p>Turn on what Terry Pratchett called &#8220;first sight and second thoughts&#8221; and try to look at the Bronze Age with fresh eyes. It was <i>really</i> weird. People would center their city around a giant ziggurat, the &#8220;House of God&#8221;, with a giant idol within. They would treat this idol exactly like a living human &#8211; feeding it daily, washing it daily, sometimes even marching it through the streets on sedan chairs carried by teams of slaves so it could go on a &#8220;connubial visit&#8221; to the temple of an idol of the opposite sex! When the king died, hundreds of thousands of men would labor to build him a giant tomb, and then they would kill a bunch of people to serve him in the afterlife. Then every so often it would all fall apart and everyone would slink away into the hills, trying to pretend they didn&#8217;t spend the last twenty years buliding a jeweled obelisk so some guy named Ningal-Iddida could boast about how many slaves he had.</p>
<p>If the Bronze Age seems kind of hive-mind-y, Julian Jaynes argues this is because its inhabitants weren&#8217;t quite individuals, at least not the way we think of individuality. They were in the same kind of trance as a schizophrenic listening to voices commanding him to burn down the hospital. All of it &#8211; the ziggurats, the obelisks, the pyramids &#8211; were an attempt to capture not individual humans, but those humans&#8217; daemons &#8211; to get people to identify the voice in their head with the local deity, and replace their free will with a hallucinatory god who <i>represented their mental model of society&#8217;s demands on them</i>. In the best case scenario, the voice would be interpreted as the god-king himself, giving you orders from miles away. Jaynes argues the Bronze Age was obsessed with burials and the afterlife (eg the Pyramids) because if you had internalized the voice in your head as Pharaoh Cheops, the voice wasn&#8217;t going to go away just because the actual Pharaoh Cheops had died hundreds of miles away in the capital. So even after Pharaoh Cheops dies, as far as all his subjects can tell, he&#8217;s still around, commanding them from the afterlife. So they had better keep him really, really happy, just as they did during life. Jaynes presents various pieces of evidence that the main function of pyramids was as a place where you could go to commune with the dead Pharaoh&#8217;s spirit &#8211; ie ask it questions and it would answer them. </p>
<p>He has a similar explanation for idols. The Bronze Age loved idols. There were the giant idols, ones that made the statue of Zeus at Olympia look like a weak effort. But also, every family had their own individual idols. Archaeologists who dig up Bronze Age houses just find idol after idol after idol, like the ancient Sumerians did nothing except stare at idols all day. Jaynes thinks this is approximately true. Idols were either cues to precipitate hallucinatory voices, or else just there to make conversation more comfortable &#8211; it&#8217;s less creepy if you can see the person you&#8217;re talking to, after all.</p>
<p>Then, around 1250 BC, this well-oiled system started to break down. Jaynes blames trade. Traders were always going into other countries, with different gods. These new countries would be confusing, and the traders&#8217; hallucinatory voices wouldn&#8217;t always know all the answers. And then they would have to negotiate with rival merchants! Here theory of mind becomes a huge advantage &#8211; you need to be able to model what your rival is thinking in order to get the best deal from him. And your rival also wants theory of mind, so he can figure out how to deceive you. Around 1250 BC, trade started picking up, and these considerations became a much bigger deal. Then around 1200 BC, the Bronze Age collapsed. It&#8217;s still not exactly clear why (some of you may have heard me give a presentation on this), though most guesses involve a combination of climate change plus the mysterious Sea Peoples. Whole empires were destroyed, their populations become refugees who flooded the next empire in turn. Now <i>everyone</i> was in unfamiliar territory; <i>nobody</i> had all the answers. The weird habits of mind a couple of traders had picked up became vital; people adopted them or died.</p>
<p>But as theory of mind spread, the voices of the gods faded. They receded from constant companions, to only appearing in times of stress (the most important decisions) to never appearing at all. Jaynes interprets basically everything that happened between about 1000 BC and 700 BC as increasingly frantic attempts to bring the gods back or deal with a godless world. </p>
<p>Now, to be fair, he cites approximately one zillion pieces of literature from this age with the theme &#8220;the gods have forsaken us&#8221; and &#8220;what the hell just happened, why aren&#8217;t there gods anymore?&#8221; As usual, everyone else wimps out and interprets these metaphorically &#8211; claiming that this was just a poetic way for the Mesopotamians to express how unlucky they felt during this chaotic time. Jaynes does not think this was a metaphor &#8211; for one thing, people have been unlucky forever, but the 1000 &#8211; 750 BC period was a kind of macabre golden age for &#8220;the gods have forsaken us&#8221; literature. And sometimes it seems oddly, well, on point:</p>
<blockquote><p>My god has forsaken me and disappeared<br />
My goddess has failed me and keeps at a distance<br />
The good angel who walked beside me has departed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or:</p>
<blockquote><p>One who has no god, as he walks along the street<br />
Headache envelops him like a garment</p></blockquote>
<p>Jaynes says that &#8220;there is no trace whatsoever of any such concerns in any literature previous to the texts I am describing here&#8221;.</p>
<p>So people got desperate. He says this period was the origin of augury and divination. Omens &#8220;were probably present in a trivial way&#8221; before this period, but not very important; &#8220;there are, for example, no Sumerian omen texts whatsoever&#8221;. But after about 1000 BC, omens become an international obsession.</p>
<blockquote><p>Towards the end of the second millennium BC&#8230;such omen texts proliferate everywhere and swell out to touch almost every aspect of life imaginable. By the first millennium BC, huge collections of them are made. In the library of King Ashurbanipal at Nineveh about 650 BC, at least 30% of the twenty to thirty thousand tablets come into the category of omen literature. Each entry in these tedious irrational collections consists of an if-clause or protasis followed by a then-clause or apodosis. And there were many classes of omens&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8211; If a town is set on a hill, it will not be good for the dweller within that town.</p>
<p>&#8211; If black ants are seen on the foundations which have been laid, that house will get built; the owner of that house will live to grow old.</p>
<p>&#8211; If a horse enters a man&#8217;s house, and bites either an ass or a man, the owner of the house will die, and his household will be scattered.</p>
<p>&#8211; If a fox runs into the public square, that town will be devastated.</p>
<p>&#8211; If a man unwittingly treads on a lizard and kills it, he will prevail over his adversary.</p></blockquote>
<p>And then there are the demons. Early Sumerians didn&#8217;t really worry about demons. Their religion was very clear that the gods were in charge and demons were impotent. Post 1000 BC, all of this changes.</p>
<blockquote><p>As the gods recede&#8230;there whooshes into this power vacuum a belief in demons. The very air of Mesopotamia became darkened with them. Natural phenomena took on their characteristics of hostility toward men, a raging demon in the sandstorm sweeping the desert, a demon of fire, scorpion-men guarding the rising sun beyond the mountains, Pazuzu the monstrous wind demon, the evil Croucher, plague demons, and the horrible Asapper demons that could be warded off by dogs. Demons stood ready to seize a man or woman in lonely places, while sleeping or eating or drinking, or particularly at childbirth. They attached themselves to men as all the illnesses of mankind. Even the gods could be attacked by demons, and this sometimes explained their absence from the control of human affairs&#8230;</p>
<p>Innumerable rituals were devoutly mumbled and mimed all over Mesopotamia throughout the first millennium B.C. to counteract these malign forces. The higher gods were beseeched to intercede. All illnesses, aches, and pains were ascribed to malevolent demons until medicine became exorcism. Most of our knowledge of these antidemoniac practices and their extent comes from the huge collection made about 630 B.C. by Ashurbanipal at Nineveh. Literally thousands of extant tablets from this library describe such exorcisms, and thousands more list omen after omen, depicting a decaying civilization as black with demons as a piece of rotting meat with flies.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;and angels, and prophets, and all the other trappings of religion. When the gods spoke to you every day, and you couldn&#8217;t get rid of them even if you wanted to, angels &#8211; a sort of intermediary with the gods &#8211; were unnecessary. There was no place for prophets &#8211; when everyone is a prophet, nobody is. There wasn&#8217;t even prayer, at least not in a mystical sense &#8211; as Jaynes puts it, &#8220;schizophrenics do not beg to hear their voices &#8211; it is unnecessary &#8211; in the few case where this does happen, it is during recovery when the voices are no longer heard with the same frequency.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Assyrians invented the idea of Heaven. Previously, Heaven had been unnecessary. You could go visit your god in the local ziggurat, talk to him, ask him for advice. But word went around that gods had retreated to heaven &#8211; some of the stories even use those exact words, blaming the Great Flood or some other cataclysm. The ziggurats shifted from houses for the gods to <i>e-temen-an-ki</i> &#8211; pedestals that the gods could descend to from Heaven, should they ever wish to return.</p>
<p>By 500 BC, the ability to hear the gods was limited to a few prophets, oracles, and poets. Jaynes is especially interested in this last group &#8211; he cites various ancient sources claiming that the poets only transcribe what they hear gods and goddesses sing to them (everyone else wimps out and says this is metaphorical). For Jaynes, the <i>Iliad</i> starts &#8220;Sing, O Muse&#8230;&#8221; because the poet was expecting a hallucinatory Muse to actually appear beside him and start singing, after which he would repeat the song to his listeners as a sort of echolalia.</p>
<p>Jaynes ends by referencing one of my favorite ancient texts, Plutarch&#8217;s <A HREF="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/De_defectu_oraculorum*.html"><i>On The Failure Of Oracles</i></A>. Plutarch, writing around 100 AD, is not a skeptic. He believes oracles work <i>in theory</i>. But he records a general consensus that they don&#8217;t work as well as they used to, and that some day soon they will stop working at all. Jaynes believes that as the theory-of-mind waterline rises, fewer and fewer people hear the voices of the gods. By the Golden Age of Greece, it was so difficult that only a few specially selected people placed in specially numinous locations could manage &#8211; the oracles. By Plutarch&#8217;s own time, even those people could barely manage.</p>
<p>The last oracle to fade away was the greatest &#8211; Delphi, perched atop a fantastic gorge as if suspended between Heaven and Earth. Jaynes tries to give us an impression of how important it was in its time; important people from all over the classical world would make the pilgrimage there, leave lavish gifts, and ask Apollo for advice on weighty matters. He thinks that the oracle&#8217;s fame protected it; if a cultural validation is an important ingredient in god-hearing, Delphi had the strongest and best. Its reputation was unimpeachable. Still, in the centuries after Plutarch, its prophecies became rarer and rarer; the Pythia&#8217;s few divine utterances became separated by more and more incoherent raving. Finally:</p>
<blockquote><p>As part of [the Emperor Julian&#8217;s] personal quest for authorization, he tried to rehabiliate Delphi in AD 363, three years after it had been ransacked by Constantine. Through his remaining priestess, Apollo prophecied that he would never prophesy again. And the prophecy came true.</p></blockquote>
<p><b>IV.</b></p>
<p>The real <i>Origin Of Consciousness In The Breakdown Of The Bicameral Mind</i> is like my edited version above, except that wherever I say &#8220;theory of mind&#8221;, it says &#8220;consciousness&#8221;.</p>
<p>Jaynes has obviously thought a lot about this, and he&#8217;s a psychology professor so I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s heard of theory of mind. Still, I am <i>so</i> against this choice. Consciousness means so many different things to so many different people, and none of them realize they&#8217;re talking past each other, and it&#8217;s such a loaded term that any argument including it is basically guaranteed to veer off into the fantastic.</p>
<p>Did he literally believe that the Sumerians, Homeric Greeks, etc were p-zombies? That there was nothing that it was like to be them? That they took in photons and emitted actions but experienced no &#8220;mysterious redness of red&#8221;? I cannot be completely sure. At times he refers to Bronze Age people as &#8220;automatons&#8221;, which seems like a pretty final judgment. But he also treats them as genuinely hearing, seeing, and having feelings about the hallucinatory gods who appear to them. The god-human interaction seems like it involves the human being at least minimally conscious. But if Jaynes has a coherent theory here, I must have missed it.</p>
<p>I think he is unaware of (or avoiding) what we would call &#8220;the hard problem of consciousness&#8221;, and focusing on consciousness entirely as a sort of &#8220;global workspace&#8221; where many parts of the mind come together and have access to one another. In his theory, that didn&#8217;t happen &#8211; the mental processing happened and announced itself to the human listener as a divine voice, without the human being aware of the intermediate steps. I can see how &#8220;consciousness&#8221; is one possible term for this area, if you didn&#8217;t mind confusing a lot of people. But seriously, just say &#8220;theory of mind&#8221;. </p>
<p>Jaynes seems aware of this objection, which he summarizes as &#8220;the Bronze Agers did not lack consciousness, they just lacked the <i>concept</i> of consciousness&#8221;. His retort is that in some cases, the concept of a thing is the same as the thing itself &#8211; he suggests baseball as an example. This seems a little sophistic to me. If somebody told me that Mandarin Chinese doesn&#8217;t have a word for &#8220;consciousness&#8221;, I would be surprised but not stunned &#8211; it seems like a strange word for a rich and ancient language to lack, but weirder things have happened. If somebody told me that Chinese people didn&#8217;t even have the <i>concept</i> of consciousness until it was introduced from the West, that wouldn&#8217;t shock me either &#8211; sometimes I think half of philosophers don&#8217;t even have the same concept of consciousness I do, and I can imagine the Chinese carving up the world in very different ways. But if someone told me that Chinese people <i>were not conscious</i>, I would dismiss them as a crank. So I can&#8217;t accept that having consciousness and having a concept of consciousness are exactly the same thing, and I continue to think &#8220;theory of mind&#8221; is better here.</p>
<p>The other major difference between my rewrite and Jaynes&#8217; real book is that Jaynes focuses heavily on &#8220;bicamerality&#8221; &#8211; the division of the brain into two hemispheres. He believes that in the Bronze Age mind design, the left hemisphere was the &#8220;mortal&#8221; and the right hemisphere the &#8220;god&#8221; &#8211; ie the hallucinatory voice of the god was the right hemisphere communicating information to the left hemisphere. In the modern mind design, the two hemispheres are either better integrated, or the right hemisphere just doesn&#8217;t do much.</p>
<p>I am not an expert in functional neuroanatomy, but my impression is that recent research has not been kind to any theories too reliant on hemispheric lateralization. While there are a few well-studied examples (language is almost always on the left) and a few vague tendencies (the right brain sort of seems to be more holistic, sometimes), basically all tasks require some input from both sides, there&#8217;s little sign that anybody is neurologically more &#8220;right-brained&#8221; or &#8220;left-brained&#8221; than anyone else, and most neuroscientific theories don&#8217;t care that much about the right-brain left-brain distinction. Also, Michael Gazzaniga&#8217;s groundbreaking work on split-brain patients which got everyone excited about hemispheres and is one of the cornerstones of Jaynes&#8217; theory <A HREF="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/01/170125093823.htm">doesn&#8217;t replicate</A>. Also, Jaynes says his theory implies that schizophrenic hallucinations come from the language centers of the right hemisphere, and I think the latest fMRI evidence is that <A HREF="https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/35/1/58/1929270">they don&#8217;t</A>. </p>
<p>(Also, Jaynes says his theory implies that demonic possession occurs in the right hemisphere. But some absolute madman <A HREF="https://www.oatext.com/resting-stated-tractography-fmri-in-initial-phase-of-spiritual-possession-a-case-report.php">actually put a possessed women in an fMRI machine and then exorcised her while the machine was running</A> and although it showed some odd deficiencies in interhemispheric communication, it didn&#8217;t seem to show unusual right hemisphere activity. Imagine having to write that IRB application!)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think either of these issues fundamentally changes Jaynes&#8217; theory. Just switch &#8220;consciousness&#8221; to &#8220;theory of mind&#8221;, and change the psychiatry metaphor from split-brain patients to dissociative-identity patients, and you&#8217;re fine.</p>
<p><b>V.</b></p>
<p>But there&#8217;s another class of problem that Jaynes&#8217; theory doesn&#8217;t survive nearly as well: what about Australian Aborigines?</p>
<p>Or American Indians, or Zulus, or Greenland Inuit, or Polynesians, or any other human group presumably isolated from second-millennium-BC Assyrians until anthropologists got a chance to examine them? If consciousness is an invention, and it didn&#8217;t spread to these groups, did these groups have it? If so, how? If not, why aren&#8217;t they hallucinating gods all the time?</p>
<p>I mean, some of these groups definitely have shamans and medicine men. I&#8217;m not saying none of them ever hear gods. But Jaynes claims Bronze Agers heard gods literally all the time, as a substitute for individual thought. Nothing I&#8217;ve heard from these people or the anthropologists who study them suggest anything like this is true. And these people also seem to be able to strategically deceive others, another key consciousness innovation Jaynes says Bronze Agers lacked. Or at least I assume I would have heard about it from some anthropologist if they weren&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a good sense of how Jaynes would answer this objection. The most relevant part of the book is around page 135. Jaynes argues that bicamerality (his term for the hallucinatory gods) started with agriculture in the Bronze Age Near East, though there were scattered hallucinations before then. So plausibly the Inuit, aborigines, etc, were not bicameral. They are in a pre-bicameral state, where they have neither full subjective consciousness, nor clear hallucinations of gods. They may have flashes of both, or do something else entirely, or just be <i>blank</i>. Or something. The point is, if they were perfectly normal conscious people like us, then Jaynes is wrong about everything.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;ve done some violence to Jaynes&#8217; theory by rounding it off to &#8220;theory of mind&#8221; and emphasizing it as an invented technology? But he tries to really emphasize the inventedness of it in the first few chapters, talking about how it had to be built up by layer upon layer of well-chosen metaphor. As far as I can tell I relayed that part faithfully.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m looking at <A HREF="https://www.julianjaynes.org/jjsforum/viewforum.php?f=13&#038;sid=a22e349e15e47f085e1813e3dde95bde">the bulletin board on julianjaynes.org</A>, and there&#8217;s <A HREF="https://www.julianjaynes.org/jjsforum/viewtopic.php?t=467">a post</A> by someone who met Jaynes before he died and asked him this question. They write:</p>
<blockquote><p>On the About Julian Jaynes page it says he gave a lecture at the Wittgenstein Symposium in [Kirchberg]. I was there. It was a wonderful lecture. It is a pity that his work has not had a deeper impact. I still believe he was basically right (and certainly his prose was brilliant).</p>
<p>I did ask him, by the way, whether he thought it possible that the Aborigines in Australia were not conscious as late as the 18th or 19th century. He said he was not sure and that it would be worthwhile to investigate. Well, I never did and probably no one else [did].</p></blockquote>
<p>So I don&#8217;t think I am misunderstanding him by making this criticism, and it sounds like he just bites the bullet and says maybe this was true. The main position on the forum seems to be that anthropologists weren&#8217;t asking the right questions as soon as they met uncontacted tribes, and so maybe they would have missed this. I find this hard to believe. It should be <i>really</i> easy to notice, and also the process of them learning Western theory of mind should leave some scars &#8211; at least one of them should say something like &#8220;that couple-year period when we all stopped hallucinating gods and became conscious &#8211; that was a <i>weird</i> time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jaynes partisans are able to come up with <A HREF="https://www.julianjaynes.org/jjsforum/viewtopic.php?f=13&#038;t=15">a few anthropological works</A> suggesting that the minds of primitive people are pretty weird, and I believe that, but they don&#8217;t seem quite as weird as Jaynes wants them to be. So the question becomes whether we would notice if some people worked in a pre-bicameral and pre-conscious way.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m tempted to answer &#8220;yes, obviously&#8221;, but for the counterargument, see <A HREF="https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3yrw2i/i_never_thought_with_language_until_now_this_is/">this Reddit thread</A>.</p>
<p><center><IMG SRC="https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/jaynes_reddit.png"></center></p>
<p>This guy thinks he &#8220;barely&#8221; had consciousness (in the Jaynesian sense), and it took him however many years to notice this <i>about himself</i>. It was just another <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/17/what-universal-human-experiences-are-you-missing-without-realizing-it/">universal human experience you can miss without realizing it</A>! And notice how it was the <i>culturally learned knowledge</i> that other people worked differently which shifted him to the normal equilibrium. So maybe if there was some tribe like this somewhere, it would be easy to miss.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also thinking of some cross-cultural psychiatry classes I had to take in residency. It&#8217;s well-known that some other cultures rarely get depression and anxiety in the classical Western sense. Instead, in the situations where we would become depressed and anxious, they get psychosomatic complaints, especially stomach pain. This happens to Westerners too sometimes, but in other cultures (eg China, Latin America) it&#8217;s by far the most common presentation. This seems similar to Jaynes&#8217; argument that the ancient Greeks talked about feelings in their stomachs when we would talk about thoughts in our minds. I&#8217;m not saying these people aren&#8217;t conscious or have no theory of mind. But it seems like their theory of mind must be&#8230;arranged&#8230;differently than ours is, somehow. Or that cultural expectations about how these issues express themselves are shaping the way these issues express themselves, powerfully enough that you can just have whole cultures where depression the way we experience it <i>isn&#8217;t a thing</i>. See also this <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture-bound_syndrome">list of culture-bound syndromes</A>. Make sure to read the discussion of Western culture-bound syndromes on the bottom &#8211; and make sure to spend a few moments considering what a politically-incorrect person might add to the list.</p>
<p>Even if I don&#8217;t accept all the stuff about hallucinatory Athena choreographing the Trojan War, the most important thing I&#8217;m going to take away from <i>Origin of Consciousness</i> is that theory of mind is an artifact, not a given, and it&#8217;s not necessarily the same everywhere. Much of the way we relate to our mind is culturally determined, and with a different enough cultural environment you can get some <i>weird</i> mind designs in ways that have real effect on behavior. Theory-of-mind-space is wider than we imagine, whether we&#8217;re thinking about ancient Sumerians or our ordinary-seeming neighbors.</p>

					<div class="pjgm-postcontent">
				<p>Continuing <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/05/28/creationism-unchallenged/">yesterday&#8217;s discussion of fake news:</A></p>
<p><A HREF="https://www.dartmouth.edu/~nyhan/fake-news-2018.pdf">Guess et al</A> says that 46% percent of Trump voters endorsed the Pizzagate conspiracy theory. Does this mean fake news is very powerful?</p>
<p>We can compare this to belief in various other conspiracy theories, as measured by the <A HREF="https://blogs.chapman.edu/wilkinson/2016/10/11/what-arent-they-telling-us/">2016 Chapman University Survey Of American Fears</A>. About 24% believe there&#8217;s a government conspiracy to cover up the truth about the moon landing, 30% about Obama&#8217;s birth certificate, and 33% about the North Dakota crash.</p>
<p>This last one is especially interesting because there was no unusual crash in North Dakota when the survey was written. The researchers included it as a placebo option to see if people would endorse a conspiracy theory that didn&#8217;t exist. 33% of them did.</p>
<p>Before we make fun of these people, consider: there&#8217;s a strong presumption that surveys don&#8217;t contain made-up questions. There was no &#8220;don&#8217;t know&#8221; option included on the poll, just various shades of &#8220;agree&#8221; or &#8220;disagree&#8221;. In order to condemn the people who &#8220;agreed&#8221; that the government was probably covering up the crash, we would have to assert that the more correct answer was &#8220;disagree&#8221;. In other words, that people should have an assumption of trusting the government, until they get some specific reason to distrust it. You can make that argument, but it&#8217;s not obvious. You could also start from the opposite assumption, where the government is guilty until proven innocent.</p>
<p>To put it another way, suppose I gave you the following survey:</p>
<blockquote><p>SELECT AGREE OR DISAGREE, YOU MAY NOT SAY &#8220;DON&#8217;T KNOW&#8221; OR LOOK FOR MORE INFORMATION. Alex Jones is lying when he talks about:</p>
<p>1. Sandy Hook<br />
2. The coronavirus<br />
3. Obama&#8217;s birth certificate<br />
4. The North Dakota crash</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;many of us would guess he was lying about the North Dakota crash, without a second thought. And if there later turned out to be no North Dakota crash, we wouldn&#8217;t feel particularly ashamed; under the circumstances we made the right choice. If you think the government is as untrustworthy as Alex Jones, well, there you go.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve previously talked about <A HREF="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/12/noisy-poll-results-and-reptilian-muslim-climatologists-from-mars/">a lizardman constant of 4% on polls</A>. That is, it&#8217;s hard to get a poll result much lower than four percent for anything, because of respondents making mistakes or trolling. If 4% of people supposedly believe something, that doesn&#8217;t mean we need to be concerned about that fraction of the population, it just means that poll has it its floor and it&#8217;s hard to conclude what the real number is.</p>
<p>In the same way, maybe we can posit a North Dakota constant of 33%. This is how many people believe in conspiracy theories when there&#8217;s no reason at all to believe them, not even the flimsy reasons conspiracy theories usually provide. Sometimes, if there&#8217;s a lot of evidence against them, fewer than 33% will believe in a given theory. But if it&#8217;s just &#8220;Conspiracy! True or false?&#8221; &#8211; 33% will say true.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look again at that statistic from the Guess paper &#8211; &#8220;46% of Trump voters believe&#8221;. I think their source is <A HREF="https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/ljv2ohxmzj/econTabReport.pdf">this poll</A>, which finds:</p>
<p><center><IMG SRC="https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/nd_pizzagate.png"></center></p>
<p>Overall 38% of Americans agreed with the claim, so Trump voters (46%) were not outrageously more likely than anyone else. Other groups unrelated to ideology were about equally likely to believe it (eg 45% of Hispanics).</p>
<p>Like the North Dakota question, this one had no &#8220;unsure&#8221; or &#8220;what the hell are you talking about&#8221; option, forcing everyone to feign agreement or disagreement. We see that the majority of agreement is lukewarm. 75% of Trumpists and 85% of Hispanics who believe Pizzagate only &#8220;probably&#8221; rather than &#8220;definitely&#8221; believe it.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think the evidence suggests Trump voters live in an outrageously different world from the rest of us. Instead, it suggests there&#8217;s a North Dakota constant of 33% &#8211; the number of people who will believe a conspiracy theory for no particular reason. It looks like about 10 &#8211; 15% more Trump supporters than predicted believe Pizzagate, probably because it attacks Clinton, and 10 &#8211; 15% fewer Hillary supporters than predicted believe it. But these are relatively small effects, and equaled by eg whatever mysterious thing is going on with Hispanics. In any case, it all averages out to about the predicted amount.</p>
<p>Why is this North Dakota Constant of 33% so different from the Lizardman Constant of 4%? I don&#8217;t know. Lizardmen seem like a pretty crazy conspiracy theory, but is Hillary&#8217;s involvement with Satanic pizza parlors really that much less weird? Sure, Pizzagate is more politicized, and that might make some difference &#8211; but then how come a full 24% of Democrats believe it, six times more than Lizardman&#8217;s Constant predicts?</p>
<p>One part of the story is that the lizardman poll offered &#8220;don&#8217;t know&#8221;, and 7% of people chose that. If, denied that option, those people would split evenly between yes and no, that brings us up to 7%ish pro-lizardman. But that&#8217;s still nowhere near 33%.</p>
<p>I think this is probably a story about low-information voters. If you imagine you&#8217;ve never heard about Pizzagate, and you read the question as written, it doesn&#8217;t sound too outlandish. Some Clinton staffers&#8217; emails contained some code words. The pedophilia and Satanic abuse are pretty out there, but post-Jeffrey Epstein we all assume somebody&#8217;s doing some kind of creepy pedophilia stuff somewhere. Maybe if you don&#8217;t know anything about this, and you don&#8217;t have the strong priors about Satanic ritual abuse that you get from studying the history of those claims in the 80s and 90s, this one seems like a toss-up. Certainly it seems like <i>more</i> of a toss-up than a clearly-stated assertion that reptilian aliens rule the world. If your prior is &#8220;most conspiracy theory-ish things are probably true&#8221;, this sounds like the kind of thing that could be true, whereas you might balk at the lizardman statement.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another question from the same poll:</p>
<p><center><IMG SRC="https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/nd_obama.png"></center></p>
<p>Who believes Obama was secretly born in Kenya? Lots of people &#8211; including 28% of blacks. I&#8217;ve been told again and again that birtherism is a racist conspiracy theory and no person could possibly believe it except as a way of dog whistling white supremacy. Yet here we are with 28% of blacks supporting it &#8211; and this isn&#8217;t a small sample either! I have no idea what these people are thinking, except that 28% is pretty close to the North Dakota Constant and maybe we should just write this one off.</p>
<p>I conclude we probably shouldn&#8217;t draw too many conclusions from specific statements like &#8220;X% of [GROUP] supports [CONSPIRACY THEORY]&#8221;, especially if X is around 33%. It&#8217;s probably just the North Dakota Constant. Likewise, we shouldn&#8217;t interpret Pizzagate&#8217;s high polling numbers as much evidence that fake news is very convincing &#8211; though you could still make an argument that fake news plays a role in transmitting believable conspiracy theories to people who are predisposed to believe them.</p>
<p>Of course, there are some high-information voters who still believe these things really strongly. I think they deserve a more complete treatment, which I want to give later. I think a preliminary sketch might look like: if you start with a prior on something being true, you don&#8217;t necessarily need much evidence. The North Dakota question suggests that conspiracy theorists start with a high prior on any given conspiracy being true. What remains to be explained is why some people stick to that prior even after they get more information.</p>
