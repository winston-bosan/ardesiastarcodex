					<description><![CDATA[The flip side of this is weight loss after bariatric surgery.  Apparently the surgeons &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/health/bariatric-surgery.html?_r=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; know ahead of time&lt;/a&gt; what weight you will stabilize at.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Her predicted final weight is 180 pounds, based on a statewide database of nearly 70,000 bariatric operations by 80 surgeons in Michigan. Doctors use it to calculate what a person Jessica’s age and starting weight can expect to weigh a year after the operation, when nearly all the weight loss will have occurred.

But her goal is to weigh 130 or 140, and she plans to diet to get there if the surgery does not do it for her.

Almost all patients have such vows, her surgeon, Dr. Varban, says. But they rarely succeed in losing more weight and keeping it off. The surgery resets their weight at a lower level, but it is just as hard to lose more than that as it was to lose weight before the surgery.&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

Class? Seriously? Poor people get eating disorders as well. They can get anorexia nervosa as well. This &quot;disgust&quot; you talk about has nothing to do with class or caste. It has to do with how the brain processes things, in an errant way, misidentifying food as a threat (think phobias/ anxiety disorders when fear is there when it &quot;shouldn&#039;t&quot; be.)]]></description>

Plenty of people with anorexia nervosa do not smoke (me). and not all of them are rich, blonde teenagers. (me) I didn&#039;t get why when went to treatment how some of them actually started up smoking; or restarted. The few I talked to, it was to take the edge off of the anxiety. Most people don&#039;t realize that in some sense, eating disorders are very much anxiety disorders, and add to that the cognitive distortions, that can be in part *just* from starvation alone. If you read the Minnesota Semi-Starvation Experiment, it is noted how the men start acting like those with eating disorders.]]></description>

But anorexia nervosa is not a culture bound illness. It occurs in &quot;third world&quot; countries, as well as developed countries. Much like OCD, and other mental illnesses, like schizophrenia, environment can shape how the illness is expressed and may be a PART of triggering it.]]></description>

I am something of a tea addict, when I am within reach of a kettle, so it was several cups a day. Maybe it was the change in taste, though. But yes, my weight is rather stable.]]></description>

I&#039;m not sure I understand what you mean by a red herring. When a woman gives birth, there is the weight of the baby and the weight of the mother. My own was low, the baby&#039;s was ok, so I wasn&#039;t worried on his behalf. On my own, I knew I had to eat, eat, and eat, and I ate what I could (and yes, it felt mostly awful, but there still wasn&#039;t much I could do about it; it&#039;s just life). There was simply nothing else to it.

As to priming him for obesity, I guess it&#039;s possible, but not probable. Everybody on my side is thin, everybody on his father&#039;s side is portly, &#038; beyond that, I know nothing for certain. He is &lt;i&gt;too thin&lt;/i&gt; for his age, but he&#039;s also on a diet for having inherited my gallbladder.

What precautionary principle do you mean?]]></description>

You should go to the doctor. You may have tapeworms. (no joke)

A brief google search says underweight women should gain between 28 and 40 lbs during pregnancy. 

You claim to have gained 22 lbs. Even with an extended range, this is still on the low end. Additionally, as someone who doesn&#039;t know you personally, my guess is that there is a reasonable chance you are underreporting the weight gain. Although you have more self-information than I do, so please don&#039;t take my guess personally. 

Regardless, this is actually a red herring. Even if you gain the expected amount of weight, you&#039;re still pregnant and underweight. How do you know that all 22lbs went to the pregnancy? What if 5-10 lbs went into your own tissue?

You can ask this same question of a person at any body weight, but it is much more likely for a &quot;starved&quot; person to misallocate weight than a normal-weight person.

There are also epigentic concerns. I am very far from an expert but I&#039;m sure I&#039;ve read research somewhere that obese parents may contribute to their childrens&#039; obesity via their obesity &quot;priming&quot; the fetus for a food-scarce environment.

It also feels like there should be a pretty strong precautionary principle when raising children. There&#039;s no benefit to being very underweight while pregnant, and at least a small chance of significant harm.]]></description>

Your weight is far more stable than mine if you can meaningfully detect a difference of a kilogram. Mine bounces around more than that constantly:



Also, it just doesn&#039;t make sense to me that a 48-calorie tablespoon of sugar could add up to anything significant. I think you were worried about it and looked for evidence it was making a difference.]]></description>
