					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;One way of resolving this: maybe happiness is the derivative of neural confidence? It’s the feeling of your confidence levels increasing, the same way acceleration is the feeling of your speed increasing?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This idea seems similar to one of the ideas advanced by Van de Cruys, S. (2017). &lt;a href=&quot;https://predictive-mind.net/papers/affective-value-in-the-predictive-mind&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Affective Value in the Predictive Mind.&lt;/a&gt; In T. Metzinger &#038; W. Wiese (Eds.). Philosophy and Predictive Processing: 24. Frankfurt am Main: MIND Group. doi: 10.15502/9783958573253

The most relevant quote from that article is (emphasis, and typos introduced by copy-pasting from the PDF, by me):

&lt;blockquote&gt; If we define drives as prediction errors or discrepancies between current and expected state (Keramati
and Gutkin 2011), we end up a new way of looking at the a ective, experiential value of rewards as well. Reward value is directly dependent on drives in the sense that the reward value of, say, a drop of water depends on the internal drive state of the organism (e.g., a thirsty rat). It is easy to see that what is critical then is the change in prediction errors (drive states). Hence, positive value is de ned as a decrease of prediction errors, while negative value can be equated with an increase in prediction errors.

More generally, &lt;b&gt;we propose that the affective valence is determined by the change in (or first derivative of) prediction error over time&lt;/b&gt; (Joffily and Coricelli 2013; Van de Cruys and Wagemans 2011)4, with positive valence linked to active reduction of prediction errors, and negative to increasing pre- diction errors.  is makes sense because these temporal dynamics signal whether the organism is making progress (or regress) in predicting its environment, which in the long run translates in proper functioning of the processes of life (fitness) (Damasio 2003). It is easy to see that the reward value of food very much depends on how large the prediction error initially was (i.e., how hungry you were), and hence how big a change the food consumption induced, but we propose this is a general pattern.

[...]

However, Bromberg-Martin &#038; Hikosaka (Bromberg-Martin and Hikosaka 2011) have managed to show that monkeys too are prepared to work to receive cues that reduce their uncertainty (reduce errors), even though their choice had no in uence whatsoever on the actual reward subsequently received.  e animals even chose the information cue more con- sistently than they typically choose a high probability reward over a low probability reward (Niv and Chan 2011). Moreover, these informational gains elicited dopaminergic neural activity in midbrain regions similar to that for conventional rewards. Our account would predict that such e ects general- ize to other animal species, but of course, for there to be changes in prediction errors there need to be predictions formulated.  erefore, the speci c instances of predictive gain will depend on the kind of models an animal constructs about its world.

[...]

Behavioral testing of these ideas is challenging because these dynamics are subject to learning and because it can be di cult to determine the predictions participants apply. Suggestive evidence comes from a recent study looking at the a ective consequences of con ict resolution (Schouppe et al. 2014).  ese authors build on the priming study by Dreisbach &#038; Fischer (Dreisbach and Fischer 2012) which showed that incongruent Stroop stimuli, as opposed to congruent ones, can prime people to more quickly evaluate negative words or pictures than positive ones (an indirect measure of negative a ect). Schouppe et al. (Schouppe et al. 2014) report that, while incongruent stimuli are indeed aversive, once they are successfully solved more positive a ect will follow than for congruent stimuli.  e original prediction error (con ict) seems conducive to later reward from resolution, consistent with what we propose here. Future studies should attempt to induce, violate and resolve new predictions in the lab to see if these dynamics have the hypothesized emotional e ects.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A later idea from that paper goes further, linking affective valence to &lt;i&gt;predictions of the first derivative of prediction error&lt;/i&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt; Carver and Scheier already argued that emotion is about moni- toring the rate of discrepancy (prediction error) reduction, as we propose above. However, their anal- ysis suggests a pertinent extension of what we presented so far.  ey suggest that the rate of mismatch reduction is in turn subject to a control loop, comparing actual with expected rate of change. Only when the current rate of prediction error reductions deviates from the expected rate of reduction, so Carver and Scheier argue, one experiences emotion.  is will of course be positive a ect if the rate of progress to the goal is higher than expected, negative if it is lower than expected. 

[...]

Based on PP, this makes a lot of sense. As we described, prediction error minimization is the way we perceive and act, so we are reducing errors all the time, e.g., when we successfully use our senso- rimotor system to walk the street. Generally, little positive or negative emotion is involved despite these constant error reductions.  is may mean that these changes in sensorimotor errors are not large enough, but most likely what rate is substantial depends on the expected rate of reduction for the current sensorimotor context. Where do the predictions of rates come from?  ese might very well be contextually learned through the same predictive machinery as for ‘ rst-order’ predictions. In fact, PP already includes second order expectations about precisions, which can be considered as (inverse squared) expected prediction errors (Mathys et al. 2014).  e higher order prediction errors that are used to update these expected precisions (so-called volatility prediction errors or VOPEs) compare predicted prediction errors (predicted uncertainty) with observed prediction errors (actual uncertainty). For example, if  rst level prediction errors (also called value prediction errors or VA- PEs6) are reduced, but the corresponding VOPEs do not decrease, the error continues to be lower than expected, possibly providing a basis for positive a ect. It still needs to be clari ed to what extent the temporal derivatives and expected rates as described here can be realized using expected volatilities per se (Jo ly and Coricelli 2013), but these developments at least suggest learning about such second order states is possible within a PP system.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I don&#039;t have sufficient expertise in the relevant areas to offer my own comments, but I wanted to briefly mention that source as it might contain useful material and references for developing the quoted idea from the post.]]></description>

You probably have tried it, but if not:
There is this inflammation mediators mumble mumble central nervous system mumble depression hypothesis. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/behindtheheadlines/news/2016-10-19-anti-inflammatory-arthritis-drugs-may-help-with-depression/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bernhard_Baune/publication/305252601_Are_Non-steroidal_Anti-Inflammatory_Drugs_Clinically_Suitable_for_the_Treatment_of_Symptoms_in_Depression-Associated_Inflammation/links/57c91b7508aec24de044fb77/Are-Non-steroidal-Anti-Inflammatory-Drugs-Clinically-Suitable-for-the-Treatment-of-Symptoms-in-Depression-Associated-Inflammation.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) Currently a study is done trying an antiinflammatory and mildly antibiotic drug for depression treatment.

Like a commenter above, I get depressed (and confused) when my allergies are triggered. Less with airborne allergens that still cause asthmatic symptoms and conjunctivis, much stronger with foodstuffs that fire up neurodermatitis. Antihistaminics do somewhat reduce the mental symptoms, but &lt;i&gt;antiiflammatory drugs&lt;/i&gt; do this much more: After a diclophenac, the night&#039;s sleep is refreshing and the next day is a good one. A fraction of topical steroids probably make their transdermal way and have a systemic effect, too, that improve mood (but reduced itching etc is a confounder here).

Have you tried antiinflammatory drugs? (Also, I hope I don&#039;t do you injustice, did you mention alcoholism some time ago? Fire water even in small doses causes low-level liver inflammation. Maybe that&#039;s why &lt;a href=&quot;http://curetogether.com/depression/ig/treatment-effectiveness-vs-popularity&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; its the single worst self-treatment (yet quite popular; I guess because of the short-term relief).

If antiinflammatory drugs turn out to be helpful: Search for medications that can be taken long-term i.e., have little side-effects. Maybe there is also an allergic reaction on a constant low level (e.g. dust mite)? Does your insurance cover testing? Also, you can search for foods and herbs, etc. that are likely to lower inflammation, to try, and for their opposites, to avoid. But  there is a certain degree of alternative medicine mythology around that topic, so look for quality science reporting or health advice from reliable media.

					<description><![CDATA[What I have found through my experiences with depressed people is that the vast majority of them are not insane people in a sane society, but perfectly sane people in an insane society, people who have maladapted to their environment but would otherwise (if they had a better one) be perfectly healthy individuals. Many of them internalize their sadness and helplessness and make it a part of their identity, further reinforcing the common belief among depressed people that they are ill at a biological level (and are not merely healthy people in an unhealthy environment). I don&#039;t think the solution to this is ever going to lay in the hands of psychologists, and certainly not psychiatrists (SSRI&#039;s and SNRI&#039;s work only slightly better than chance in most people, and taking other antidepressant/mood-stabilizing medication is a hellish experience all its own) - it lays in the hands of the people who construct the environment we live in, the people in charge of its development and health, the people who have the most power over society. These are the people who have destroyed it and made the environment we all have to live in such a hellish place, and their successors will certainly be the only people who can fix it (on a societal level, at least - obviously some people really do have a brain problem, but I strongly suspect they are a minority).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;So: what if depression is pathologically low confidence in neural predictions?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I think the right thing to emphasize here is not &quot;low confidence&quot; but &quot;smeared confidence interval&quot;.  In particular, my model is that in depression, you react to surprisal by widening the confidence interval (thus lowering individual confidence).  If you have extremely narrow, but very low confidence predictions, then you should expect constant updates.  If you have extremely smeared, low confidence predictions, updates are rare.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Motivationally – well, I’m less certain, I still haven’t found a good predictive processing account of motivation I understand on an intuitive level.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I think I understand this, mainly from looking at a couple of cases:
1. Where is motivation unnecessary?  In habits and impulses, certainly.  If the normal mode of acting by adjusting to match predictions happens without you becoming consciously aware of a difference between prediction and sensation, then motivation is unnecessary.
2. Where is motivation unquestionably strong?  In addiction, in visionaries, in fanatics.  The commonality here seems to be that there&#039;s a prediction somewhere that&#039;s (almost?) completely resilient to contradictory sense data.
3. Where is motivation present but weak?  In the marshmallow test, in the presence of temptation.  It seems that motivation troubles come when you consider changing your predictions / model, but can&#039;t quite settle.

From this, I model motivation as a capacity to (consciously? deliberately?) reinforce predictions in the face of contradictory sense data.

&lt;blockquote&gt;One complicating factor – how do we explain depressed people’s frequent certainty that they’ll fail?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Depressed people aren&#039;t updating predictions nearly as frequently as those who are not depressed.  But they still update predictions, and if the evidence never contradicts the prediction, eventually the smeared &quot;I&#039;m uncertain&quot; prediction will narrow to whatever is perceived.  This doesn&#039;t quite fit the claim, but I&#039;m not sure the claim is accurate.  In depression, is the claim &quot;I&#039;ll fail, every time&quot;, or is the claim &quot;if I succeed, it&#039;ll be just random chance, and trying to succeed doesn&#039;t have any impact on success&quot;?  The latter fits my model: confidence intervals are smeared until you are not sure whether you&#039;ll succeed or fail, in any particular endeavor.  More importantly, you predict that you have no control over success or failure (and I think it&#039;s harder to get sense data saying &quot;you control this&quot; when you think you don&#039;t than to get sense data &quot;you have no control&quot; when you think you do---maybe the source of confirmation bias is somewhere around here).

&lt;blockquote&gt;Section 7.10 gives a kind of hand-wave-y answer here, saying that of course organisms have some drives, and probably it makes sense for them to desire novelty and explore new options, and so on.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Uh, it seems like there&#039;s a simpler explanation here.  The brain seeks not to minimize prediction error (couldn&#039;t it do this by making all of its prediction confidence intervals maximally smeared?), but to maximize the amount of prediction error it can eliminate (or maximize the amount of surprise it can extinguish).

&lt;blockquote&gt;But why would low confidence cause sadness?

Well, what, really, is emotion?

But mania looks a lot like being happy. And you’re happy when you succeed a lot.  And when you succeed a lot, maybe having increased confidence is the way to go. If happiness were a sort of global filter that affected all your thought processes and said “These are good times, you should press really hard to exploit your apparent excellence and not worry too much about risk”, that would be pretty evolutionarily useful. Likewise, if sadness were a way of saying “Things are going pretty badly, maybe be less confidence and don’t start any new projects”, that would be useful too.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I think this is too high-level and hand-wavy.  I also think that claiming happiness as a global filter is wrong.  You can be happy and sad at the same time.  You can be happy about one thing and sad about another thing at the same time.

Consider the following examples:
1. Infants look at surprising stimuli longer.  They extinguish surprise by making sense of it, not by looking away.  I expect, moreover, that if you teach a toddler that one room always contains an unsurprising stimulus, and another room always contains a new and surprising stimulus that can be made sense of relatively quickly, the toddler will seek to enter the room with the surprising stimulus, &lt;i&gt;even before they encounter the surprise&lt;/i&gt;.  (Does anyone know if this is true?)
2. The reference description I&#039;ve heard about mania &quot;if you think you’ve found a theory that explains everything, diagnose yourself with mania and check yourself into the hospital&quot;.  The internal experience of thinking you&#039;ve found a theory that explains everything is that you have a theory, and you keep finding surprising stimuli that make sense when you model them with the theory---you keep being surprised and extinguishing that surprise.  You keep having &quot;ahhh, that makes so much sense!&quot; moments.
(Other interesting examples that fit well here: NRE / crushes, rats in rat park vs isolation)

I infer that the experience of happiness is somehow very, very closely tied to the internal experience of successfully extinguishing surprise.

I expect there is one variant of depression that corresponds to abnormally low surprise.  Things tend not to be surprising, updates don&#039;t happen.  I think the internal experience of this would be blankness or muteness of emotions (or, at least, the emotions that are driven by surprise, so, anger, awe, hatred, probably pleasure, probably pain, probably happiness, possibly sadness, etc.).

(The internal experience of having lots of surprise and failing to update seems like the experience of sensory overload.)

There&#039;s a bit of nuance, though, and a nice symmetry.  I&#039;ve read that &lt;a href=&quot;https://relentlessdawn.wordpress.com/2015/12/11/the-art-of-grieving-well/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;to grieve is to familiarize oneself with a surprising and painful truth until it is no longer surprizing&lt;/a&gt;.  Exposure therapy is similar: you repeatedly confront yourself with a surprisingly-not-bad stimulus until its not-badness is no longer surprising.  In happiness, I expect, you repeatedly confront yourself with a surprisingly-good stimulus until its goodness is no longer surprising.

My current model is that pain is when you experience surprisal, and both the sense data and the predictions fail to update.  Pleasure, then, should be the internal experience of experiencing surprisal going away.  (This explains, perhaps, why being mindful brings more pleasure to movement: you become aware of when and how your body goes from not matching your desired location to matching it.)

This suggests a second sort of depression, perhaps more closely matching what you describe in the post: in this one, there is surprise, and it isn&#039;t resolved well.  Here, you&#039;d have low confidence predictions that ought to additionally be resistant to being updated.  Here you wouldn&#039;t have muted sadness, but intensified sadness: reality would be painful, because your predictions conflict with your sense data and both are slow to update (the sense data because your predictions lack confidence; the predictions due to whatever mechanism causes them to be resistant to updates).  This seems a bit off, though.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>So: what if depression is pathologically low confidence in neural predictions?</p></blockquote>
<p>I think the right thing to emphasize here is not &#8220;low confidence&#8221; but &#8220;smeared confidence interval&#8221;.  In particular, my model is that in depression, you react to surprisal by widening the confidence interval (thus lowering individual confidence).  If you have extremely narrow, but very low confidence predictions, then you should expect constant updates.  If you have extremely smeared, low confidence predictions, updates are rare.</p>
<blockquote><p>Motivationally – well, I’m less certain, I still haven’t found a good predictive processing account of motivation I understand on an intuitive level.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think I understand this, mainly from looking at a couple of cases:<br />
1. Where is motivation unnecessary?  In habits and impulses, certainly.  If the normal mode of acting by adjusting to match predictions happens without you becoming consciously aware of a difference between prediction and sensation, then motivation is unnecessary.<br />
2. Where is motivation unquestionably strong?  In addiction, in visionaries, in fanatics.  The commonality here seems to be that there&#8217;s a prediction somewhere that&#8217;s (almost?) completely resilient to contradictory sense data.<br />
3. Where is motivation present but weak?  In the marshmallow test, in the presence of temptation.  It seems that motivation troubles come when you consider changing your predictions / model, but can&#8217;t quite settle.</p>
<p>From this, I model motivation as a capacity to (consciously? deliberately?) reinforce predictions in the face of contradictory sense data.</p>
<blockquote><p>One complicating factor – how do we explain depressed people’s frequent certainty that they’ll fail?</p></blockquote>
<p>Depressed people aren&#8217;t updating predictions nearly as frequently as those who are not depressed.  But they still update predictions, and if the evidence never contradicts the prediction, eventually the smeared &#8220;I&#8217;m uncertain&#8221; prediction will narrow to whatever is perceived.  This doesn&#8217;t quite fit the claim, but I&#8217;m not sure the claim is accurate.  In depression, is the claim &#8220;I&#8217;ll fail, every time&#8221;, or is the claim &#8220;if I succeed, it&#8217;ll be just random chance, and trying to succeed doesn&#8217;t have any impact on success&#8221;?  The latter fits my model: confidence intervals are smeared until you are not sure whether you&#8217;ll succeed or fail, in any particular endeavor.  More importantly, you predict that you have no control over success or failure (and I think it&#8217;s harder to get sense data saying &#8220;you control this&#8221; when you think you don&#8217;t than to get sense data &#8220;you have no control&#8221; when you think you do&#8212;maybe the source of confirmation bias is somewhere around here).</p>
<blockquote><p>Section 7.10 gives a kind of hand-wave-y answer here, saying that of course organisms have some drives, and probably it makes sense for them to desire novelty and explore new options, and so on.</p></blockquote>
<p>Uh, it seems like there&#8217;s a simpler explanation here.  The brain seeks not to minimize prediction error (couldn&#8217;t it do this by making all of its prediction confidence intervals maximally smeared?), but to maximize the amount of prediction error it can eliminate (or maximize the amount of surprise it can extinguish).</p>
<blockquote><p>But why would low confidence cause sadness?</p>
<p>Well, what, really, is emotion?<br />
&#8230;<br />

I had the same intuition re SSRIs and time-lag, and it has me wondering if you initially couple SSRIs with something that temporarily narrows all of your confidence intervals (do amphetamines do this?), would that be enough of a kick-start to eliminate the lag time, even if you drop the confidence-interval-narrower.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[All of this rings very true and familiar. If strong predictions guide actions, it&#039;s clearer why depressed people are asked to think positively. 

Also kinda &lt;i&gt;depressing&lt;/i&gt; from a rationalist perspective.

Having accurate beliefs, like 90% of start-ups fail, may send you into a negative spiral. Perhaps it&#039;s better not try hard to be a realist. You cannot have accurate beliefs independent of your emotional state.

This seems to paint depression as an adaption (avoid uncertain situations) rather than a weird brain failure.
