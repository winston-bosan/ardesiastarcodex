Nyb, that&#039;s favour economy, not being paid. Hell, even a slave is fed out of their master&#039;s pocket, but we don&#039;t traditionally consider that &quot;pay&quot;.

FC: I&#039;m not sure, but some studies have found that fields have their salaries go down when women enter them. That suggests that it&#039;s something to do with bargaining power - perhaps perception that women are unqualified in some fields make their wages go down in others?]]></description>

Hey, this is a month late, but if you ever come back to this thread:

Inside of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2014/09/02/which-countries-excel-in-creating-new-drugs-its-complicated/#&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2014/09/02/which-countries-excel-in-creating-new-drugs-its-complicated/attachment/table/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this graph&lt;/a&gt; which shows drug chemistry produced by country per decade over the last half century.

Using google and wikipedia mostly, I also looked up the healthcare policies of the various countries mentioned, to see if there were any legislative changes that might correlate with changes in drug production numbers.

-France Healthcare delcared universal in 1974. 1976 and 1977 saw budget adjustments and reduced payment for medications. precipitous Drop from 1970&#039;s to 1980&#039;s.

-German price controls instituted mid-80&#039;s. Notice drop from 70&#039;s to 80&#039;s, and 80&#039;s to 90&#039;s, as the before, transition, and after decades.

-Japan instituted price controls in late 1980&#039;s. See 1980&#039;s vs 1990&#039;s.

-The UK has been nationalized since the 60&#039;s. It is perpetually low across all four decades.

I&#039;m not an expert on any international medical law or systems. But I&#039;m curious if this chart adds to your point in a very general, demonstrable manner.  Ie, government enacts more socialist, less restrained medical system practices, and amount of drugs produced drops.

Now, that article is asking a different question of &quot;Does this really count as an American Drug if it came from a research lab in England?&quot; but I don&#039;t think that matters for the analysis here. Because as you say, inventing a drug is actually prety easy. Its done all the time all over the world in universities and research labs.  It&#039;s the testing and refining and regulation that cost the huge amounts. And all the companies HQ&#039;d in the US are obviously going to be going for FDA certification on their drugs.

I&#039;d appreciate hearing any interpretations you have on this data, and any correlations to medical policy of the listed countries.  Are they at all valid?]]></description>

My God, that was devastating.

&lt;blockquote&gt;If I help this company sell, it&#039;ll seed a half-dozen new black tech entrepreneurs. They&#039;ll go on to hire plenty more black engineers, and do it in Atlanta.

At Google, I&#039;ll be encouraged to take annual Bias-Busting training, gathering with other privileged honkeys to encourage one another&#039;s virtuous respect of black coworkers we don&#039;t have.

I&#039;ll then make money for Californian white people who don&#039;t think the South merits a lousy engineering office.&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

The bungalows might just be a California thing. Californians seem to be pretty accepting of shacks, as protecting from the weather is usually not as urgent for them as it is in some places (and Colorado is indeed an example of a place prone to troublesome weather you wouldn&#039;t encounter in California).]]></description>

&#062;Most Baby Boomers in Southern California, for example, went to school in shacks, typically without air conditioning.

I recently looked at the Boomer elementary school I attended in the 60&#039;s on google maps.  The bungalows, essentially double wide trailers, installed in the sixties to deal with the extra students, are still there!  (Cubberley Elementary, San Diego).  Here in Colorado the schools look like high end club houses for a private golf resort.  I am thinking not many parents would tolerate their kids attending class in a trailer.  Another factor, different from the boomer era, is size.  It seems to me that schools physically are much larger and the number of students attending seem to be much larger than 40 years ago.  I wonder if there are statistics that that show a cost correllation with those two factors?

With respect to the general discussion of the cost vs. outcome, it seems like we are stuck on a path of not changing the approach in any meaningful way.  Keep doing essentially the same thing forever and hope for a better outcome.  In the case of health care - make it worse by adding a layer of government intervention.  Instead of just taking all the money and implementing a single payer system [and shut down insurance companies], we will have state and federal &quot;help.&quot;  I am not oppossed to a government health care mandate, but I am at a loss at how we could reduce the cost of the system by adding additional layers of &quot;management&quot; and &quot;oversight.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The link you posted to the Oregon Experiment (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1212321#t=articleTop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) doesn&#039;t seem to match what you said about it. You mention it doesn&#039;t effect health outcomes in a meaningful way, but the study&#039;s authors state:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We found that insurance led to increased access to and utilization of health care, substantial improvements in mental health, and reductions in financial strain, but we did not observe reductions in measured blood-pressure, cholesterol, or glycated hemoglobin levels.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Those effects aren&#039;t massive, but they certainly are &quot;meaningful&quot;.
Did you just disagree with the analysis of the authors?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think that the cost disease in higher education is actually less severe than it appears. Tuition has increased tremendously, but tuition is not a great measure of how much college actually costs. Cost per student is more accurate because it’s a measure of how much money it actually costs to educate a student, rather than how much the student is paying, which as you mentioned could be much more arbitrary. Luckily, the story for cost per student is a lot less bleak. Using the same tuition data set you did and adjusting for inflation, it looks like tuition on average was &lt;a href=&quot;https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d07/tables/dt07_320.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;$9,000 in 1992&lt;/a&gt;, but according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED383730.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;1992’s OECD education report&lt;/a&gt;, the cost per student was $22,000. At public institutions, the cost per student was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oecd.org/edu/EAG2014-Indicator%20B1%20(eng).pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;$18,000 in 1992 and $26,000 in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, which is not nearly as severe an increase as the tuition numbers would imply.

	It doesn’t look like education has ever been cheap; it looks like it was just heavily subsidized. A cursory look at per-student spending in other countries shows costs similar to the United States, even in higher education. The US still spends considerably more than other nations, but not by a factor of 10 (for higher education it’s twice the average, for primary and secondary it’s even lower). German universities had a cost per student of about &lt;a href=&quot;http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED383730.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;$11,000 in 1992&lt;/a&gt;, compared to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oecd.org/edu/EAG2014-Indicator%20B1%20(eng).pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;$17,000 today&lt;/a&gt;. This is a smaller increase compared to the United States, but it isn’t that far off.

	This isn’t really any comfort to students though; even if cost per student is increasing more slowly than tuition, tuition is what we actually pay, and an increase of a factor of 10 is really bad. What it does mean is that the “cost disease” is happening in the price tag, rather than the actual cost. ‘Universities are charging too much’ seems like an easier problem to solve than ‘higher education is mysteriously getting more costly.’

	I think your idea that colleges charge what they can get is probably close to the truth. In Germany, where tuition is covered entirely by the state, universities have less of the administrative bloat and fewer frills than American ones, with much larger class sizes and much lower student engagement through extracurricular activities. Universities have no leverage to charge more because it isn’t up to students whether to pay those fees. In the United States, many students get federal aid, which means students can choose where to put the government funds allocated to education. Students on average spend &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/average-net-price-over-time-full-time-students-sector&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;thousands of dollars&lt;/a&gt; below the posted values due to aid and scholarships. What this means is that colleges can charge as they please, taking much of their income from federal money and scholarships rather than students. This money can be put towards all the wonderful amenities that American universities tend to have, which have to get nicer and nicer every year as universities keep up with each other.

	Basically, tuition is a lousy indicator of education cost, and cost per student is not actually increasing as dramatically as it appears. Additionally, the average student doesn’t pay the posted tuition value. That doesn’t magically make tuition lower, but it does mean that the problem is probably easier to solve than it seems. Tuition is likely just increasing because colleges are charging what they can, and until something is done about that, costs will continue to rise.]]></description>

<p>	Basically, tuition is a lousy indicator of education cost, and cost per student is not actually increasing as dramatically as it appears. Additionally, the average student doesn’t pay the posted tuition value. That doesn’t magically make tuition lower, but it does mean that the problem is probably easier to solve than it seems. Tuition is likely just increasing because colleges are charging what they can, and until something is done about that, costs will continue to rise.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t read all 1000 comments, but enough to get the flavor.  Here is the crazy one.  The religious explanation, Haggai 1:5-10.
&lt;blockquote&gt; Now, therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts: Consider your ways. You have sown much, and harvested little. You eat, but you never have enough; you drink, but you never have your fill. You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm. And he who earns wages does so to put them into a bag with holes.  Thus says the LORD of hosts: Consider your ways. Go up to the hills and bring wood and build the house, that I may take pleasure in it and that I may be glorified, says the LORD. You looked for much, and behold, it came to little. And when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why? declares the LORD of hosts. Because of my house that lies in ruins, while each of you busies himself with his own house.  Therefore the heavens above you have withheld the dew, and the earth has withheld its produce. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Nah, couldn&#039;t be. Absolute craziness.]]></description>
