&lt;blockquote&gt;It sounds like you are one of the people who doesnâ€™t think there is a third element in a romantic relationship/marriage beyond sex and friendship.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But I do! It&#039;s &quot;having offspring&quot;.  :)]]></description>

It sounds like you are one of the people who doesn&#039;t think there is a third element in a romantic relationship/marriage beyond sex and friendship. You certainly aren&#039;t unique, but a lot of people would disagree (obviously this is a subjective thing and no-one can really be right or wrong).

@Bugmaster
Are you referring to yourself or Anonymous?]]></description>

Conglomeration of all of those would be the answer off the top of my head, along with the resulting synergy.  Because simplifying those down to points in isolation misses out on a lot of the positives of each.

I&#039;d like to sleep with someone I love, respect, and trust, and having been a sex worker for years I don&#039;t extend any of those to prostitutes in general (And further, wouldn&#039;t recommend others to do so either).  Prostitutes are good at one thing, and that is convincing you of a narrative that gets them what they want.

The women I date pull their own weight, show me new things that I would never have known about, and we are able to mutually open up more than platonic friends in ways facilitated by the tighter bond of trust that a sexual relationship can help to create and cement.

I personally have no real interest in marriage or reproduction at this point, but very much enjoy mid to long term partners that bring most of the other benefits.

If your goal is wedding bells and a brood, then that&#039;s a great goal.  I have a lot of respect for the guys who are looking to do a good woman right, put a ring on her finger, and settle down.  It&#039;s not the only path though, and we all get to choose what we want out of relationships.  So I hope you nail this family meeting and it all works out perfectly.

As sort of a PSA to the other commenters here to cut down on outgroup homogenity, this is what an actual pickup artist looks and sounds like.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Is it? Itâ€™s certainly one of many points of dating, but itâ€™s obvious status as sole driving force is news to me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I mean, what else? Prostitutes are cheaper, and probably more skilled for sex, internet porn is essentially free for masturbatory release, and companionship hardly requires dating. As near as I can tell, the point of dating is getting to know the other person and deciding whether to enter into a reproductive contract with them and having a brood of offspring.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Best of luck to you.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thank you.]]></description>

Well then, fill your boots, I guess!

So far, there hasn&#039;t been another comment in the thread that would pass a redpill/pua ITT.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, Iâ€™m obviously considering marrying her. Thatâ€™s the point of dating.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I would argue that it&#039;s a losing strategy because all these RPSM are having lots of sex (relative to being involuntarily celibate, but probably inferior to traditional marriages, where the wife is expected to put out on demand), but having very few children.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Honestly, this isnâ€™t the forum to ask for an accurate view of redpill/pua answers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I don&#039;t agree. There are people who are familiar with it here, and at the same time not swallowing everything that infosphere produces uncritically. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus far no one has even mentioned that it depends on what you want to accomplish. Unless youâ€™re already intending to marry this girl, having her family (especially her father) dislike you isnâ€™t the end of the world, and depending on the girl can be a counterintuitive positive.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Well, I&#039;m obviously considering marrying her. That&#039;s the point of dating. If I didn&#039;t think she were prospective wife material, I wouldn&#039;t even start.

Thanks for the tips!]]></description>

The strategies the other commenters have discussed will work better if you are already considering becoming a member of the family.  I particularly like your stance that the evaluation is going both ways, as I think this creates a solid, active frame (As long as you&#039;re not going about it abrasively.) rather than defaulting to a passive role in the interaction.  Aside from that, being sociable, polite, and not a pushover will get you most of the way there.

For evaluating the family, typical class based judgements are probably the best you&#039;ll get before you actually dig in and talk to them.  Trying to play Sherlock Holmes here will probably be a lot less effective than just steering the conversation towards things you&#039;re interested in knowing (Barring ridiculously obvious red flags like rat problems, exposed sharps left out, overpowering smells, firearms left out on the coffee table, rusted out vehicles on the lawn etc).]]></description>
