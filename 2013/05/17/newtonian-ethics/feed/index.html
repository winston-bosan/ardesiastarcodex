					<description><![CDATA[This is a groundbreaking insight, but just as classical theories of gravity break down at quantum scales, so too does your classical gravito-morality model fail to explain why tiny structures like gametes and blastocysts can exert such powerful moral forces on people thousands of miles away. 

How can abortion protesters be compelled to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.40daysforlife.com/location.cfm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;travel internationally&lt;/a&gt; by the plight of early-stage fetuses typically massing a few grams? 

How can the Pope care so much for the fate of African spermatozoa? Even accounting for the greater mass of the total African sperm reservoir, he should still be much more concerned about Italian and European sperm. 

There must be some kind of spooky action at a distance involved. Oh for a unified theory which explains quantum mechanics &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; morality.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is my standard summary of the influence that upright, bipedal posture left on our moral language: good people are straight, elevated, active, forward, and stable, while bad people are crooked, fallen, lazy, backward, and wavering.

There&#039;s a separate prejudice against things that travel low to the ground (slithering, crawling), but that&#039;s because snakes, worms, insects, arachnids are unsanitary or harmful. Absent those indicators, humans don&#039;t generally feel abhorrence, disgust, contempt toward other species being low down, crooked, lazy, and unsteady as evidenced by ground squirrels, starfish, manatees, sloths, and fainting goats.]]></description>

Or perhaps the Einsteinian ethics is about rate at which we must make choices. In the normal world we generally make ethical choices at a &#039;normal&#039; pace, choices made under either faster conditions (you have 30s to decide), or slower conditions (take a week, go think about it) would likely alter the moral balance because we have time to ponder and think more. Similarly exposure to the event, seeing the same homeless guy every day vs a different one would likely alter the moral choices again.]]></description>

That&#039;s actually kind of where this came from. Luke was talking about problems for ethics if the Universe was infinitely large, in which case there would be an infinite amount of both happiness and suffering and none of our actions would affect the total. Although there are a couple ways to deal with this, I suggested one of them might be a function where moral relevance decreases with distance.]]></description>
