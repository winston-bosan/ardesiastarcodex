Yes, it&#039;s amazing how lacking in empathy the professional purveyors in good cheer are. . . if we could get up and go, we wouldn&#039;t need advice.

Hmmm. . . . 

For those who want an idea, I offered my story, &quot;Isabelle and The Siren&quot;, published in &lt;I&gt;Sword And Sorceress XVI&lt;/I&gt;.  The heroine is depressed.  Other people with a history of depression have told me that it conveys what they feel very well.]]></description>

Read &lt;i&gt;Feeling Good&lt;/i&gt; by David Burns. It&#039;s CBT, non-cheesy, very compatible with LessWrong-ism, plus I think it&#039;s clinically proven to work. I cannot recommend it highly enough. 

Also regarding the drug ideas, what the fuck, guys?]]></description>

Being able to emulate this kind of management-speak is a survival technique; too often the &lt;i&gt;diktat&lt;/I&gt; comes down from head office that they want a new mission statement (I think the newest buzz phrase is &#039;vision casting&#039;?) and if you send back an honest assessment (&#039;we don&#039;t have time for this crap, if you let us hire an extra staff member we&#039;d increase efficiency and productivity instead of writing these nonsense reports&#039;) then you may find yourself seeking alternative employment where your synergy is a better fit with the active partnership relationship for thriving with a provider of inspiring, innovative services and solutions.]]></description>

I think that&#039;s misguided. I think the ability to write fluffy nonsense deliberately is paradigm-enabling to provide optimal outcomes for clients internal and external. No, wait...

What you might want is people who are unwilling to write these things, and resist them with vigor when seen. But being able to emulate bullshit as a game is a useful skill; I have no doubt SA could achieve an outstanding achievement in the field of excellence in satirical mission statement writing, and I don&#039;t think SA or younger SA-equivalents ought to be disqualified for this skillset.]]></description>

Persuade a young college grad from a good school to spend a year or two working in the admissions office.  Have him/her send you the applications that have excellent test scores and essays that show lack of ability to BS.]]></description>

That&#039;s the one bit of advice or request I&#039;d make of you, starting out on a medical career:

Try and treat your patients like people, not as a file on your desk that you only saw five minutes ago.]]></description>

Thanks for the offer of help, Scott.  Part of my problem is I am so resistant to going to the doctor because I am so bloody suspicious of, and not trusting towards, medical establishment in Ireland (absolutely did not help when my physical health went bad in the past five years, and I met four different consultants for various things, only one of whom treated me as a human being and not a hysterical ignorant stupid nuisance).

I&#039;m in Waterford, so the nearest to me would be either Waterford City or Cork City.

Also, no worries about the drugs.  I hate with a passion taking even prescription drugs, so I am in no way tempted to indulge in unprescribed things I have no idea of their strength, purity or effects on top of me generally having idiosyncratic reactions to medication anyway :-)]]></description>
