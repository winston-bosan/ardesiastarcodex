					<description><![CDATA[I have to keep you updated because I&#039;m simply AMAZED at the results of this  spell you performed for me. Everything is going so well and EXACTLY how you said it would be. Even though it took 5 months to fully progress, it was so worth it because things are just about at perfection! How you took my situation and completely turned it around to give me exactly what I wanted is beyond me, but something I will never question and just be completely grateful for coming across you. Bless you for helping so many people get what their heart desires. You truly gifted! . you can also contact him for help as well (arigbospelltemple@gmail. com)]]></description>

I know, the comment subscription is annoying as heck.
At the bottom of the emails should be a bit saying :

					<description><![CDATA[Victoria is my name, I am  39 years of age , from Henderson, NV, I have not done this before, but i think is will be of great benefit for me to come online and make my friends out there know about my encounter with a spell caster whom i met on net. I have had bad experiences over the years and this has made me bitter and skeptical about finding solution to my problem. Until my Aunt introduced me to a man who help her in the past and she was successful. I also did contact this man and to my greatest surprise i was so shocked for the wonderful works experience from him, He is so true to his word and what he says is what he does. I really appreciate you Lord Zilialia for you help. Thank you so much and i sincerely can&#039;t thank you enough. you have indeed done what other spell casters i have contacted cannot do for me either they cause me pain and agony. Friends please make no mistake anymore here is a man who has been  tried, tested and trusted and he never failed for once. contact Lord Zilialia on spellcaster1202@gmail.com today and put an end to your pain. don&#039;t get deceived and scammed Lord Zilialia is true and genuine. I will forever be grateful to him till eternity. Lord Zilialia you are simply the best. Contact him spellcaster1202@gmail.com.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I purchased the 23andMe kit the day after the FDA nixed them.  Therefore, I was unable to get health results from 23andMe.  But I was curious as to how I could use the genetic data provided by 23andMe - they allow you to download your raw data.

After some Googling, I found the 23andYou site.  It contains a number of services that will tell you interesting information.  Two of the services - one free, one $5 - will give you health data.  The free site (run by a team at Stanford) will only cross-reference your genome with the SNP literature database and provide a list of scientific papers that correspond with SNP&#039;s in your genome, then provide a very cryptic (for the layman) statistics chart.  The second service costs $5 but it seems to provide information that is very similar to 23andMe&#039;s health data.

					<description><![CDATA[*feels urge to do something about this*

Any chance you’ll ever share these advanced social skills you learned during your Five Thousand Years?

Obviously, some of these techniques may be evil. But you have unparalleled access to the rationalist community, so I’m guessing the instrumental value could be high.

Oh, and I’m crazy curious, of course. Hmm, I think I’ll ask this on a few posts in the hope it’ll be seen.]]></description>
