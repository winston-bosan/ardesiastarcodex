					<description><![CDATA[Any chance you&#039;ll ever share these advanced social skills you learned during your Five Thousand Years? You&#039;ve been talking about the plight of us low-social-skills ... people a lot recently.

Obviously, some of these techniques may be evil. But you have unparalleled access to the rationalist community, so I&#039;m guessing the instrumental value could be high.

Oh, and I&#039;m crazy curious, of course. Hmm, I think I&#039;ll ask this on a few posts in the hope it&#039;ll be seen.]]></description>

No, I got it.  I&#039;m saying that the idea of this one woman getting her tentacles into every online community I&#039;ve ever had contact with disturbs me less than the probable reality of there being thousands of people out there that are functionally indistinguishable from her.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;They’d kill us all, of course. [The aliens] would sterilize Earth so thoroughly that not even the archaeobacteria would remain. But in the moment before I was vaporized, I would feel like our species had finally been understood.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are times -- not many, but a few -- when I catch myself thinking that &lt;a href=&quot;http://qntm.org/destroy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;certain tasks&lt;/a&gt; are too important to leave to strangers.  And then there&#039;s the Copernican principle: half the time, the aliens will be worse.

Still, I think you&#039;re being too hasty here.  Besides the parallels you note, you and this DysScribe person both seem to have gotten started circa 1999.  So I&#039;m more inclined to believe that you, she and a lot of other people all happened onto a novel superstimulus at around that time.

Have you read &lt;em&gt;Comeuppance&lt;/em&gt; by William Flesch?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Am utterly tickled to find a recent reference to this story!  It&#039;s my fave internet guilty pleasure, like a train wreck or a disgusting slug I can&#039;t look away from--and the scariest part?  Most of the players were grownups, and some were even moms of small children!  What were their children getting into while they were all fighting over who Harry Potter should wind up smooching *shudder*]]></description>
