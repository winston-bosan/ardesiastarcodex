					<description><![CDATA[&quot;A lot of people would argue that doxxing holds people “accountable” for what they say online. But like most methods of silencing speech, its ability to punish people for saying the wrong things is entirely uncorrelated with whether the thing they said is actually wrong. It distributes power based on who controls the largest mob (hint: popular people).&quot;

You’ve been talking about the plight of us low-social-skills … people a lot recently. Any chance you’ll ever share these advanced social skills you learned during your Five Thousand Years?

Obviously, some of these techniques may be evil. But you have unparalleled access to the rationalist community, so I’m guessing the instrumental value could be high.

Oh, and I’m crazy curious, of course. Hmm, I think I’ll ask this on a few posts in the hope it’ll be seen.]]></description>

A lawyer doesn&#039;t need to endorse his clients position. He or she needs to not undermine it. 

And if you can come up with a way that a lawyer can advocate one position in court and another outside without making his advocacy less convincing in a court room, we&#039;d all love to hear it.]]></description>

Patrick:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I can justifiably get in trouble for expressing opinions on political questions that do not involve confidentiality ...[L]et’s pretend I do eminent domain cases, and on the job I argue that a particular taking is justified, while off the I say eminent domain verges on tyranny.  That would justifiably get me in trouble ...Identical legal work from someone who did not look like a hypocrite would be more valuable than mine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Accusations of hypocrisy would be unfair. Representing a client is not the same as morally endorsing the client or arguments made on the client&#039;s behalf.

In the world where a lawyer must endorse her client&#039;s cause, sophisticated lawyers will toe party lines, and unpopular causes will lack the advice which helps them to access legal rights. This seems bad.

We are better off with a norm of &lt;b&gt;neutrality&lt;/b&gt; in legal practice, where lawyers do not morally judge their clients and are not morally judged for serving particular clients.]]></description>
