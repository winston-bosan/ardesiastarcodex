					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m reading this much later than when it was originally published, but some points I noticed in the general post:

&quot;This difference in the success of immigrant groups is often closely correlated with the success of the countries they come from. Japan is very rich and advanced, Europe quite rich and advanced, Latin America not so rich or advanced, and Africa least rich and advanced of all. And in fact we find that Japanese-Americans do better than European-Americans do better than Latin-Americans do better than African-Americans&quot;

I think the problem here is that you are comparing self-selected immigrants from other countries to the general black American population, many who were NOT self-selected from their respective original countries many centuries ago.

If you compare the education rates of groups like Nigerian-Americans, you find that they are on par/in the same vicinity as various Asian-American groups, etc.

The other point is regarding lower divorce rates in more traditional marriages, etc. Another reason there might be higher divorce rates in families where both parents work might be similar to why celebrities seem to get divorced so often: Both parties can afford this. Compare this to the model where one partner doesn&#039;t work and it becomes tricky, because said partner is now solely dependent on the other&#039;s money. Another topic worth looking at is the social stigma with divorce, which might be greater in some groups vs. others. 

One thing about pushing the view that &quot;sexist&quot;, etc. societies lead to greater happiness is that it&#039;s often embraced by a lot of groups who may actually see this as an either/or situation and use it for justification of their stance, i.e. &quot;Let&#039;s make all women stay at home, like it used to be, because they were happier then too&quot; (the by products leading to very real discrimination women might face at the work place, being given less of a choice over wanting to work vs. having a family, etc.).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Possibly relevant to the discussion of the Harvard entrance exam: http://timesonline.typepad.com/dons_life/2015/11/smalle-latine-and-lesse-greeke.html. To summarise, it was (and to some extent still is) common practice to teach Latin and Ancient Greek using well-known classical texts, which examiners *also* used to set questions. This meant there was a fair chance that any given passage on the exam paper was one that the student had seen before. The passages in the Harvard exam are from famous works by Cicero, Livy, and Aelian, so we should probably account for the chance that some students might have read the original Latin and Greek before taking the exam.

From my own viewpoint: I only did GCSE Latin (GCSEs = UK high school exams, usually taken at age 16 after 2-3 years of study). I certainly wouldn&#039;t have done well at the Harvard exam, but I would have had a rough idea of what I was doing. If I&#039;d carried on studying Latin to university entrance level, I reckon I could&#039;ve managed a respectable mark. I&#039;d probably struggle at least as much to get into modern-day Harvard, honestly.]]></description>

So, since the original claim in the post still stands... well, i guess i should be rather sceptical of assumptions (more precisely, arguments to sources) in this post. As opposed to logical reasoning.

Too bad.]]></description>

Wrong. 

Progressivism is indeed a &quot;unitary thing&quot;. Stalin fits the Nordic model just fine, insofar as the Nordic model is progressive. You don&#039;t really understand politics. Not really. You&#039;ve never had sight of the political backbone of the left (and the antipodal backbone of the right). You still see the left and the right as shadows cast by a selection of policies. If the impression of the sum of all policy seems to conform to what you identify as democratic or progressive, you identify the government as such. The same holds true for your identification of right-wing governments. My, my, whatever do you do when the all-too-frequent contradictions present themselves? Like most progressives, I assume that you ignore them completely. China must really confuse you with all of their anti-liberal laws. How does the restriction on freedom of speech in Sweden sit with you? This willful ignorance of the contradictions is why progressives, despite their frequent intellectual vanity, fail to acquire a basic understanding of modern politics. If you didn&#039;t ignore the contradictions, you would need to ask difficult questions. Difficult questions about the left, and its history, modern manifestation and purpose, would spell deep trouble for your worldview and those like you.

Do you actually think that the far left and the far right could move with the terrible power that allows them to bend deeply ingrained culture as they do, either in their full or muted (covert) forms, if their power was rooted in a hazy selection of policies with no clear threshold for what constitutes the &#039;left&#039; and the &#039;right&#039;?

It&#039;s utterly meaningless to the power structure of the left whether or not women, gays, and minorities are given special consideration or protections. You don&#039;t understand politics.

It&#039;s true that the left utilizes the politics of individualism that would advocate for special considerations for homosexuals, women, and minorities. However, only fools believe that individualism is the goal. Individualism is not the goal. Individualism is the process that is utilized to achieve the goal. The goal is not individualism, but the destruction of its opposite: authentic and politically powerful community rooted in common culture (in contrast to the false and powerless community of the class struggle). Real community is destroyed with its opposite: individualism. However, the weapon that is individualism is not needed in its active political form once it has done its job and the political remnants of the &#039;cultural revolution&#039; (cultural destruction) are loosely attached with the paper surrogate that is class association and a communist government is instated. 

Stalin had no use for homosexual, women&#039;s, or minority rights in Russia. To what end? The battle was won, and propping up any group would only introduce instability into the culture of the class war. In the non-Soviet west that was mobilized to defeat authoritarianism in WWII, such violent and overt communist takeover isn&#039;t possible. Therefore, the progressive soldier uses the spear of individualism, and its associated edges of  minority group rights, to make communities and their associated democratic power ever more brittle in a slow walk toward leftist power (ie: no middle class) that will ensconce a small aristocracy in power with no political nor military possibility of removal.]]></description>
