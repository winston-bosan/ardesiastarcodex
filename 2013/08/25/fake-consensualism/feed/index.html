&lt;i&gt;Later decide&lt;/i&gt; felt like being sexually abused? You been on the redpill again, Scott?

Seriously, I think the sheer obvious truth that BSDM should be legal is making you overstate your case by trivializing rape. Probably a similar effect is responsible for much trivializing of rape in similar ways by conservatives actually ... hmm, thanks for the insight into that.]]></description>

It&#039;s actually more complicated than that.

You can consent to anything up to GBH (but not murder / manslaughter) on a wide range of &#039;acceptable&#039; grounds - many of which are totally reasonable (e.g. medical care, extreme sports) but up to and including including &#039;rough horseplay&#039;, used to great effect as a defence in cases of military hazing...

But &#039;sexual&#039; is not one of those grounds for consent.

You _can_ consent to battery for sexual purposes - it&#039;s ABH and above that you can&#039;t consent to for that purpose. (ABH being essentially &#039;anything that doesn&#039;t heal up in a couple of days&#039;).]]></description>

&quot;initiation of force my arse.&quot;

What do you think the police do when someone breaks these laws, e.g. allows me to buy suitable euthanasia drugs? Or what they do if I am &quot;caught&quot; trying to end my life?

&quot;And I am willing to use whatever force is optimal for avoiding disutility.&quot;

I have no idea how &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; self-ownership causes &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; disutility! Unlike you, I have not demanded a right to meddle with your body, money and life!]]></description>

Well that&#039;s very ... melodramatic, and of course hypocritical (initiation of force my arse.) But yeah, as a matter of fact,  I do &quot;make a claim on&quot; things you plan to use to cause me disutility. And I am willing to use whatever force is optimal for avoiding disutility.

With that said, I have since read Scott&#039;s follow-up suggesting the netherlands slippery-slope data is flawed, and Yudowsky&#039;s point that it&#039;s much much better to just use cryogenics rather than struggle this hard to give people small, unpleasant amounts of time. So I&#039;m not quite as anti-euthanasia as I was when I wrote that.]]></description>

Is it that in boxing you risk being injured but don&#039;t know which injuries if any will actually occur, and it&#039;s different if the specific injury is known beforehand?

Or is there just no way this makes any sense?]]></description>
