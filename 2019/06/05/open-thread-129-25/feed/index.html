Atypical, in that we interact with the other tribe online?  I&#039;d heard rumors that the two sides argue with each other on Facebook and Reddit and Twitter as well, but I don&#039;t go there much, so I&#039;ll take your word for it.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Stewart has definitely employed a defense that The Daily Show as ‚Äújust a comedy show‚Äù.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If you&#039;re thinking of the Crossfire appearance, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s what we&#039;re talking about here.  Stewart was complaining that Crossfire was bad journalism, Tucker Carlson kind of turned it around on him, and Stewart said &quot;but my show is comedy&quot; meaning &quot;...and that&#039;s why it doesn&#039;t meet the standards I&#039;m accusing you of not meeting.&quot;  He wasn&#039;t being accused of saying something wrong/offensive/etc.

&lt;blockquote&gt;it‚Äôs that the point they‚Äôre making is wrong. When you confront them over the facts, and that they‚Äôre leading people to draw wrong conclusions, they put on the clown nose.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As I said earlier in a post you misunderstood, I don&#039;t believe this exchange happened; on the occasions I dimly remember I&#039;m pretty sure they responded, &quot;nuh uh, we weren&#039;t wrong.&quot;  Happy to see evidence to the contrary.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Do you understand the difference between allegedly offensive (Crowder) and allegedly factually incorrect (the Johns)?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes, I saw your comment about China&#039;s imports :)  Seriously though: 

a) I already asked for examples of things John Oliver&#039;s show got wrong (That&#039;s what Edward Scissorhands was vaguely referring to when he said &quot;In a previous OT just a week ago, someone demanded that his comedian‚Äôs facts be refuted.&quot;  That was his characterization of my asking, &quot;for anyone who thinks his piece on CPCs was bad or wrong or whatever, what specifically was wrong about it?&quot;) and don&#039;t think I got any.  (Please don&#039;t bother digging up examples of things you think they got wrong unless you can find any instance of anyone who is less right-wing than you agreeing that they got it wrong)

b) I don&#039;t understand why you would dickishly suggest I don&#039;t understand the difference between offensive and wrong, since we appear to be on the same side on this.  So to be extra clear, my position is that if A makes a joke and B complains about it and A responds, &quot;fuck off it&#039;s just a joke&quot;, that is reasonable if B&#039;s complaint was &quot;your joke implied that Trump is bad when actually he&#039;s good&quot; but not reasonable if B&#039;s complaint was &quot;your joke implied Trump raised taxes when actually he cut them.&quot;]]></description>

I wrote the wrong number here:
&lt;blockquote&gt;the rest (A &#060; B+3200, A &#062; B-3200, A+B &#062; 3200: 1% A win (A only wins if bet A succeeds, B fails)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That should say 9% A win instead.

Fixing that changes the factor 89/9 in the strategies to 81, and resulting win probability for A to 0.099999981.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/05/open-thread-129-25/#comment-758949&quot;&gt;C. Y. Hollander&lt;/a&gt;.

Here&#039;s a game-theoretic answer to a game with two participants, ignoring the third.

The exact game is defined as follows:
Player A starts with 23400 cash, and bets 0 to 23400.
Player B starts with 26600, and bets 0 to 26600
Both players win their bet with 90% probability, and win/lose the amount they bet.
Player A tries to maximize the probability of having more cash than B after betting, and vice versa.
Depending on the sizes of the bet, there are 4 different possible categories (writing &#039;A&#039; here to denote the size of player A&#039;s bet,  and ignoring the possibility of ties; note that 3200 comes from the difference in initial amounts):
A &#062; B + 3200: 90% A win (A&#039;s bet is big enough that the result only depends on whether A&#039;s bet succeeds)
A &#060; B - 3200: 10% A win (similar to above, B&#039;s bet determines the winner)
A + B  &#060; 3200: 0% A win (bets are too small to overcome B&#039;s initial advantage)
the rest (A &#060; B+3200, A &#062; B-3200, A+B &#062; 3200: 1% A win (A only wins if bet A succeeds, B fails)

Generally B wants to bet within 3200 of A, then above that range rather than below. A wants to bet at least 3200 above B, then at least 3200 below.

The general shape of the optimal strategies is determined, but they are not unique. Multiple bet amounts are functionally the same as long as they are the same integer multiple of 3200 away from relevant cutoff points.

An optimal strategy for A: bet with these relative probabilities (normalized to make them add up to 1):
23400: 1
16800: 89/9
10200: (89/9)^2
3600: (89/9)^3

An optimal strategy for B:
20200: (89/9)^3
13800: (89/9)^2
7400: 89/9
1000: 1

These give A a winning probability of 0.099916. Note that B could get it down to 0.01 just by playing the maximum bet, so that is already an almost-optimal strategy against perfect opposition. On the other hand, there is no such trivial strategy for A.]]></description>

@DavidFriedman

Yes, tariffs can only directly price negative externalities into the price of foreign products. It only works to reward positive externalities of domestic production if the tariff doesn&#039;t cause the market to switch to other products with high negative and/or low positive externalities.

Of course, when that happens the government can turn to subsidies, which have their own issues.

My point is not that tariffs (or subsidies) are obviously correct/justified, but that your model and the models of economists in general are too simplistic to show that they are incorrect. Ultimately, your rebuttal merely consists of disbelief that the complexity of the situation can be captured in a tariff structure that improves the situation in the eyes of the populace.

You have not demonstrated that the overall downsides of tariffs are always greater than the overall upsides.

Are you not making the rather common mistake of making a simplified model normative, instead of descriptive, even though you have no particular reason to believe that your model captures the complexity of reality?]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Idea: the Shakespeare scholars can take the Bible and try to support traditional credits; the Biblical scholars can go conclude that Shakespeare‚Äôs canon was actually written by seven and a half different people.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Maybe this was your point and I&#039;m just restating it, but in my recollection that&#039;s more-or-less what happened, albeit with fields of study rather than scholars.  There was a fashion, a century or so ago, for critical scholars to dissect Shakespearean works and detect different authors, some positing a single alternative person (e.g. Bacon, Marlowe, Raleigh) and others a mass of alternative authors.  Whereas modern Shakespearean scholarship in the last 20-30 years seems much more strongly on board with &quot;the far, far, far likeliest scenario is that it was William Shakespeare and all the rest of this arcane textual analysis is just castles in the air.&quot;  That is, they basically went back to regular historical assessment standards instead of &quot;Shakespearean author hypothesis&quot; standards, and found the standards strongly favored the Bard&#039;s authorship.

It seems to me that the question is whether Biblical scholarship has ever had that same kind of moment of re-examining their authorship standards.  I agree with you that it would be interesting to see it flipped.  But I also rather agree with Aron Wall that I&#039;m not entirely convinced that Biblical scholarship isn&#039;t still stuck in the prior mode, and has escaped re-examination in part because interest in the traditional model has waned along with religious practice.]]></description>

Moderate reactionary/conservative steelman: &quot;I don&#039;t want &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; to go back to the 1950&#039;s/X-time-period, but neither do I want my ideas to be dismissed out of hand for being something that showed up in the 1950&#039;s/X-time-period, and I believe what you are doing is such a dismissal.&quot;

Programming comes to mind - sometimes rewriting the function you want from &lt;strike&gt;scratch&lt;/strike&gt; a third-party implementation is the way to go (read: adopting successful policies from other countries), but often there&#039;s an older version you can revert to or copy-paste instead, without necessarily having to revert the entire program to it.
Especially for more complex functions, the number of bugs introduced by such a reversion may be unacceptably high, but that&#039;s an argument that has to be made on a case-by-case basis, and compared to the number of bugs you&#039;d expect from other approaches.]]></description>

I would think one or maybe 1.5 bathrooms was pretty typical in the 50s, based on the households that my various parents/family members grew up in.  I think this is another case of people conflating middle class with upper middle class.]]></description>
