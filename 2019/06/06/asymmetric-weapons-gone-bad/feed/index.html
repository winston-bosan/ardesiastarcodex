					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve realized that the system of &quot;affirmative consent&quot; as preached by US colleges and universities as the One True Way to negotiate short-term sexual relationships is an example of an arrangement that was created de novo and more or less enforced on a subject population.

My memory is that the idea of explicit affirmation of each stage of sexuality first reached the public notice when it was advocated by the Antioch College student government.  I remember thinking then, &quot;This isn&#039;t how humans actually behave.&quot;  And the idea seems to have attracted some ridicule.  Fast forward a couple of decades and I recently saw an article that said only some 15% of college students say they abide by the rules of affirmative consent.

In general, production of these sort of de novo ideas works reasonably well when a large community of users gets to choose which ideas they want to adopt.  Agriculture in Iowa (where I grew up) is on a rigid grid, heavily mechanized, and focuses on a few crops, but it&#039;s very successful.  OTOH, other than for the grid (which came from the Homestead Act), every detail has been adopted individually by each farm, so the bad ideas never spread very far.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;ve hit upon the exact mistake I made over and over again growing up, and which I suspect to be one of the major handicaps of smart kids who &quot;inexplicably&quot; fail to achieve social success.

I assumed that if someone believed something, they could tell me why they believed it. And I believed that they were good representatives of their position. That is, if they were right about something, I believed they would know some of the better reasons for believing it So, if they could &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; tell me it was true or useful, or they gave poor reasons for it, I assumed they were wrong.

Small talk, in particular, I remember analyzing this way. &quot;Why should I participate in small talk? It&#039;s boring.&quot; And no one could tell me why, so I didn&#039;t do it, and while it didn&#039;t ruin my life, it did slow my social growth down. Looking back now, and this applies to a lot of things, actually, I would say that people don&#039;t explicitly know most of what they know. They do know it, they know a lot of things, but they don&#039;t &lt;i&gt;explicitly&lt;/i&gt; know it; they can&#039;t articulate it. Small talk is a good example, but I think humor is another one, and a very difficult one.

Think about humor for a minute. Can you &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; explain why something is funny? No? Well, better not laugh, then, right? Comics have come under fire for &quot;edgy&quot; or inappropriate jokes, and some people seem to think there&#039;s not really a problem. You can joke about suffering and death and so on, and it&#039;s not actually a problem, they say. But we can ask them, &quot;Should we really be making light of the most horrendous things to ever plague humanity?&quot; Obviously, it seems like the answer should be &quot;no.&quot;

And yet...I sometimes have this sense myself. I hear a joke and it&#039;s just awful, it absolutely is awful, and I don&#039;t deny the awfulness of it one bit, so please don&#039;t mistake my joyous laughter for a sign that I don&#039;t think the joke is awful and the topic is awful. I&#039;m just laughing anyway. Why? Because I&#039;m an awful person? Well, maybe, or maybe...well, I don&#039;t know.

But maybe we don&#039;t understand humor very well. We can&#039;t explain what&#039;s funny and what&#039;s not, and we can&#039;t say exactly what the effect of dark humor is. At the same time, I don&#039;t really see anything bad happening because of it, and there is a sense in me that dark humor is not hurting us.

What am I supposed to do with a vague sense that something is okay, or that something is wrong? Once upon a time, I would have thrown it out the window. &quot;Only believe in things you understand,&quot; that&#039;s the motto. &quot;Only believe in things you can explain,&quot; might be part of it as well. But I&#039;ll bet that most people are like me in that, if you asked us to justify our belief that Brazil exists, something that seems so basic and obvious, we would actually have to stop and think about how we know this. &quot;Everyone knows that,&quot; ooh, I just know I&#039;m going to get hammered if I try and use a weak argument like that.  &quot;I read about it and I&#039;ve seen people talk about it in the news&quot; doesn&#039;t really sound airtight, either. Don&#039;t we know the news is less than perfectly trustworthy, and books as well? I feel pretty confident that Brazil exists, but I don&#039;t know that I can exactly tell you why.

This is the same mistake that the Pharisees made in the New Testament. They knew there was a law against harvesting on the Sabbath, so they saw Jesus and his folks picking some food and eating it, and they said, &quot;Well, you&#039;re picking up the food, right? You are physically taking the fruit off of the plant it&#039;s growing from. That&#039;s the &lt;i&gt;definition&lt;/i&gt; of harvesting. Therefore, you are harvesting! Therefore, you are breaking the law!&quot;

Explicitly, this is a hard argument to refute. I&#039;m not denying that I&#039;m picking the fruit from the plant, and if you ask just about anyone, that&#039;s pretty much the &lt;i&gt;exact&lt;/i&gt; definition they&#039;ll give for &quot;harvesting.&quot; You can definitely use the non-central example debate here, and it&#039;s probably right, but who&#039;s to say exactly how non-central an example it takes before something switches from &quot;breaking God&#039;s law&quot; to &quot;not breaking God&#039;s law&quot;?

As a result of these ideas, whenever I ask someone to explain or justify something, I listen to them, and I try to keep floating around in the back of my head &quot;this is just what they can articulate right this moment; there may very well be more to all of this.&quot; And if they say &quot;I think there&#039;s something else going on about XYZ, but I can&#039;t quite explain what it is,&quot; then I treat that with a non-trivial amount of respect.

This is very much what I think is going on with ideas like &quot;rights&quot; and also in religion. On the face of it, people just &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; religious beliefs, and it&#039;s only incidental whether or not they&#039;re happy about them or whatever. After all, I believe all sorts of unhappy facts about the world, maybe the same is true of a lot of religious people with what they have concluded are facts about supernatural entities, right? But in reality, I suspect that there&#039;s almost ZERO overlap between why people really accept/believe in their religion (and in rights) and what they tell you is the &quot;evidence&quot; for their religion (and people are almost always happy about the religious propositions they just so happen to believe are true as well as happy). 

There&#039;s a whole long list of &quot;Street Epistemology&quot; videos on YT where they get people to admit within 5 minutes that they basically don&#039;t have any reason to justify their belief in God, and while people will then semi-regularly say that they&#039;re a little less sure that God exists, mostly they change very little, or not at all.

You can extract another example out of political iconography and so on. It&#039;s actually quite hard to justify why having your banners up around the city makes much of a difference, or having a high-quality patriotic song that people can sing. Does breaking the protocol during patriotic displays (like kneeling during the national anthem) really have any larger effect? How? On what? It can be hard to say what good these things are, so we might be tempted to say that they&#039;re just meaningless frills, we can take them or leave them, they don&#039;t really matter. But we know that powerful movements and parties prioritize creating merchandise and mottoes and pledges and songs and rituals and so on. It&#039;s always possible that they&#039;re wrong and that these are worthless endeavors, but, then again, given that these are typical of successful movements, maybe they&#039;re not so worthless after all.

And if we can&#039;t &lt;i&gt;show&lt;/i&gt; you what effects they have, and if we can&#039;t point &lt;i&gt;directly&lt;/i&gt; at the causal pathway and the mechanism of the effect...maybe that&#039;s not such a knockdown argument after all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;It’s often easy to get patients to admit they don’t have a good reason for what they’re doing; for example, autistic people usually can’t explain why they “stim”, ie make unusual flapping movements. These movements are distracting and probably creep out the people around them. It’s very easy to argue an autistic person into admitting they stimming is a net negative for them. Yet somehow autistic people always end up hating the psychiatrists who win this argument, and going somewhere far away from them so they can stim in peace.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is late and few people will see it, but allistic people stim, usually when they&#039;re anxious. They just tend to do it less frequently, and are comfortable keeping their stimming within a range of culturally accepted behaviours, rather than having to do weird shit like flapping their arms or touching something soft and smooth. Here&#039;s a list of some culturally accepted stims: Taping with finger or pen, rapping fingers or knuckles, shaking leg, chewing on pencil, massaging stress ball, playing with hair, rubbing eyes or temples, rocking or swinging you chair, and others.]]></description>

Here&#8217;s a list of some culturally accepted stims: Taping with finger or pen, rapping fingers or knuckles, shaking leg, chewing on pencil, massaging stress ball, playing with hair, rubbing eyes or temples, rocking or swinging you chair, and others.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/06/asymmetric-weapons-gone-bad/#comment-760797&quot;&gt;Dack&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;An anonymous person’s assumption is not a source. That’s not even an anecdote. That’s a rumor.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It&#039;s not one person, it&#039;s many. Some of them may go on the record - but perhaps not in the news. The source of this particular example did ask not to be named. This may be to avoid reprisals against themselves or Catholic workers? It&#039;s not necessarily an easy thing to do.
It&#039;s not one event, it&#039;s many. Condom shipments are &lt;i&gt;notorious&lt;/i&gt; for going astray in Africa.
You can certainly argue that it isn&#039;t &lt;i&gt;proven&lt;/i&gt; that a catholic in was responsible in any particular event, but I suggest that when the quantities involved are millions, they&#039;ve probably not been stolen for personal use - and given that it&#039;s specific to condoms, rather than all equipment, it could be considered a reasonable suspicion.
You also might not have noticed, but all these sources are pretty diplomatic - I think because they&#039;re trying to solve the problem, not cause a shitstorm.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Do you have any sources for 1 &#038; 3?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I found some, but I&#039;m starting to feel that you must have lead a sheltered life not to be aware of these issues already.

1) High level advocacy - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hrw.org/legacy/backgrounder/hivaids/condoms1204/condoms1204.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;political lobbying&lt;/a&gt; (pdf)
&lt;blockquote&gt;In countries with significant Roman Catholic populations, governments frequently bow to pressure from religious leaders to censor information about condoms in school-based HIV/AIDS curricula or other HIV-prevention programs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

3) Exert pressure from positions of power - eg. &lt;a href=&quot;http://churchandstate.org.uk/2012/12/the-catholic-church-condoms-and-hiv-aids-in-africa/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;in the article I already linked to&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In one case, a local diocese refused to receive rent from a prominent NGO working on HIV &#038; AIDS—apparently because they were distributing condoms on Catholic-owned land—forcing the NGO to relocate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

--

&lt;blockquote&gt;I’m not sure what distinction you are trying to make here.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I was feeling disillusioned.
It&#039;s pretty disappointing when you expend effort on reasoned argument, then it appears that the disagreement was simply that someone didn&#039;t understand that a common phrase isn&#039;t meant to be taken completely literally. 
I mean, I absolutely do believe that one should use words in accordance with their definition. But, given the nature of language, there has to be some flexibility. There should be effort expended in understanding what is meant just as as in saying things well.
This is the second time this has happened to me with a phrase like that.
&quot;Do all you can&quot;, &quot;Give it your best effort&quot; and similar absolutely never mean &quot;liquidise all your assets, abandon all other goals, and your morals in the pursuit of this objective&quot;, so I&#039;m at a bit of a loss why people seem to choose this in particular to be pedantic about.]]></description>

So it would turn shift bulling from the capable to the incapable? I think that would be a very big improvement, because teachers, officers etc. already know they must pay disproportionate attention to the incapable, either find them an easier place or get them up to speed. And it is precisely that attention that stops bullying. While with bullying the capable the issue is that you get A&#039;s and B&#039;s and behave well and teachers don&#039;t pay any attention to you because you seem entirely OK and not in need of any extra attention.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Illegibility is complicated and context-dependent. Fetishes are pretty illegible, but because we have a shared idea of a fetish, because most people have fetishes, and because even the people who don’t have fetishes have the weird-if-you-think-about-it habit of being sexually attracted to other human beings – people can just say “That’s my fetish” and it becomes kind of legible. We don’t question it. And there are all sorts of phrases like “I don’t like it”, or “It’s a free country” or “Because it makes me happy” that sort of relieve us of the difficult work of maintaining legibility for all of our decisions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Another way to make illegible preferences legible is for them to be part of your religion. If you hate the taste of pork and pork products, you&#039;d probably have an easier time explaining it if you converted to Islam than just trying to convince people that you genuinely hate bacon. Similarly if you decide that for mental health reasons you need one day a week where you don&#039;t do anything, and you want to convey to people that you are absolutely serious about that one day being your rest day, telling people you&#039;re a Jew who observes the Sabbath is going to give you way more credibility than, &quot;Saturday is my day off, no exceptions.&quot; Of course this does limit legibility to established religions, so Scott probably can&#039;t get away with claiming his church doesn&#039;t let him talk on the phone except for emergencies, but nonetheless religion is a traditional way to codify otherwise illegible advice and preferences.]]></description>
