&lt;blockquote&gt;Isn’t there academic research on wealth transmission over generations? Does wealth accumulate from one generation to the next?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Again, the theory and far too common belief is that if your kid doesn’t get into Elite Preppie Kindergarten, they’ll never make it to Harvard or Yale. And will therefore wind up married to and otherwise hanging out with the sort of complete reject losers who go to State.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Except that in these circles no one goes to State. If the kids don&#039;t get into Harvard or Yale, they&#039;ll go to Brown or Penn. If they don&#039;t get in there either they&#039;ll go to Middlebury or Wesleyan. So on and so forth all the way down to Wesley.

Oddly enough some kids do go to out-of-state State and form privileged expat cliques there. No idea why.]]></description>

@abystander Vancancy decontrol is not eliminated, because the landlord&#039;s consent to an assignment is required and assignment involves the current tenant in the search costs of the new tenant. But I partly agree. The law on assignment in my jurisdiction is unclear. Specifically, the landlord&#039;s consent for an assignment is needed but cannot unreasonably be refused and I&#039;m not sure what &quot;unreasonably&quot; means in this context. I think in principle the landlord could make a side-deal with the former tenant, thus effectively increasing the rent. If they tried this with the new tenant it would be illegal rent. None of this happens either. I still think that the possibility of assignments that don&#039;t happen is evidence that there is not a big loss in misallotment of units to tenants who don&#039;t value them as much as other tenants might.]]></description>

@jack

If a rent controlled apartment can be assigned to another tenant without the landlord being able to raise the rent, then vacancy decontrol is effectively eliminated.  The moving tenant  will always collect a payment to assign the unit to another person if there is a significant difference between current and market rate.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;First, the worst rent control policies (including the San Francisco and New York policies in the IGM poll) did not include a number of features that are now normal in rent control policies. For instance, the California legislation includes vacancy decontrol, ie rent for a new tenant can be set at whatever the market can bear; limits only apply to existing tenancies. Also, the California legislation exempts new buildings. Both of these will reduce the negative effects on the supply of housing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

San Francisco rent control law does have vacancy decontrol and exemptions for new buildings.  Although the exemption for new buildings is somewhat negated by the permitting process which often requires for construction of a percentagle of rent controled units for permission to build.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Or consider a socialist (strong sense) vs a libertarian. They have some disagreements about what is just. But they have much larger disagreements about the outcomes of the two systems, including the non-consequentialist ones. If the socialist believed that socialism would lead to Stalin, the Great Purge, and the Ukraine famine, he would not be a socialist–because those things not only have bad consequences, they are massively unjust in his terms.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sure, but, despite Cassander&#039;s attempt below, I don&#039;t think you can actually know this (indeed, going back to consider some of the examples, I conceded far too much there, looking at how Pol Pot&#039;s regime lost power rather complicates the revolution = bad + left model he was proposing) and instead we&#039;ll just end up right back in body counting, or arguing from our different premises (and/or different preferred conclusions).

ETA: historical correction, let my rhetoric carry me away...]]></description>
