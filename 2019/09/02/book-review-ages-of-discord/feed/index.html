					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/09/02/book-review-ages-of-discord/#comment-795958&quot;&gt;John Schilling&lt;/a&gt;.

The telling statement is, &quot;the fact that in the 1820s “everybody whose opinion mattered” did not include women and slaves, but what difference does that make to the point?&quot; Demising the history of a group of people, as a means to defend all things were all great, and swell.

How does one not take text literal? 

Paraphrase according to Websters dictionary, a restatement of a text, passage, or work giving the meaning in another form.

Presumably, if Turchin had provided qualifiers, that would have been communicated above as a part of the paraphrase, given it seems like an important part of the narrative.

For your consideration as to a different perspective of resistance.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The reason I’m acting as I am is that I’m one of the few people here who openly self-defines as a historian. I therefore feel I can usefully contribute to this conversation, in that I can apply a subject-expert analysis. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ever think you are just another sign of elite overproduction? &quot;Historian&quot; warring with another historian getting a little more attention. 


Why is it you claim you can&#039;t merge two data series, one actual and one interpolated or reconstructed? This is done all the time in every form possible and has not a lick to do with &quot;history&quot; specifically.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Food and land are no longer limiting resources; famines, disease, and wars no longer substantially decrease population. Almost every factor that drives the original secular cycle is missing; why even consider the possibility that it might still apply?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At a certain level of polarization and inequality and elite overproduction, people find their best shot at higher status is tearing down the system (see eg all the calls for socialism, student loan forgiveness, etc.) rather than continuing to compete in a tournament they feel they can&#039;t win. 

Human nature doesn&#039;t change; relative status is still everything (for psychological happiness and the mating market especially).  There&#039;s no reason for such cycles of organized discontent to change with &quot;nominal prosperity.&quot;]]></description>

This. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;They weren’t having fewer children because they were getting wealthier, but having fewer to maintain their station (which affected their ability to generate wealth).

Anecdotally, this is very similar to the zeitgeist I’ve encountered with Gen X and Millennial professionals. They will say how they can’t “afford” children, but their actual concerns are more related to social status than basic needs, in particular living in prestigious areas and having access to high-status education are big topics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It&#039;s the barely-attainable reality of both having children and remaining at a high status level in terms of both geography and quality of life.]]></description>

+100 for a comment that gets it: whatever it is elite overproduction means, the signs are everywhere 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Apart from that major error, I think that this review has a very good analysis of the problem. We can see elite overproduction reflected in many areas – the recent college bribery scandal was one example. The way identity politics is frequently leveraged to bring down successful celebrities is another example of elites turning on each other because there are more elites in the system than there are elite job openings. People lower down on the totem pole know that there is only a limited amount of room at the top, so they use whatever tools are available to take out whomever has the top spot so that they can claim it. Creating an outrage mob to take out the people who are doing better than them (with claims of privilege or unsubstantiated #MeToo claims) &lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

Brilliantly-put comment. 

But Turchin would say human nature does not change, and what you are pointing to is just another result of or manifestation of vastly increased inequality (the relative status differentiation of men differing dramatically relative to historical norms)

&lt;blockquote&gt;But it seems distinctly different from most of these earlier modes of Turchinian civil conflict, partly because it occurs in a time of genuine material plenty &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Young people awash in student debt, much lower amounts of savings or ability to buy a home or afford a family? 

https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/

Material plenty &quot;on average&quot; is very different than material plenty of the median or 25th percentile, and especially different than there being vast inequality (with implications for relative status and the mating market) or a sense that things are getting worse economically (very well supported by polling data).]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;When we talk about “elite overproduction”, we are naming the phenomenon where too many young people train for management/bureaucratic jobs and then aren’t able to get such jobs.

Where I would argue with Dick is in his focus on government employment. The same pool of (STEM-, Pro-) BA holders fill government bureaucracies as fill corporate bureaucracies. Corporate HQ functionaries like HR/PR/Compliance are the same people as university administrators are the same people as hospital administrators are the same people as government paper-pushers of all sorts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And wasn&#039;t Scott just posting about the expolsive growth in educational and healthcare costs driven partially by the increased employment of these (rent-seeking, paper-pusher, elite-striver) types?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;My impression was that Borjas was an increasingly isolated contrarian voice, so once again, I just don’t know what to do here.&quot; Consensus? Maybe not so much.
(1) Germany´s n.º 1 economist, &lt;b&gt;Hans-Werner Sinn&lt;/b&gt;, is in full agreement with Borjas. From his book &quot;Schwarzer Juni&quot; (Black June [a book on Brexit, the migrant crisis and the euro]), page 104 (my translation): &quot;One could believe that it makes no difference for the existing population whether there is migration of workers or not [&lt;b&gt;my note:&lt;/b&gt; since the effect for the economy as a whole is neutral]. But that is not the case, for, even if the size of the cake at the disposal of the existing population remains constant, its distribution changes very substantially [ganz erheblich]. Those who compete with migrants lose out for reasons I will discuss later, due to increased wage competition. Those are mostly the people with low qualifications. In contrast, those who pay for their services win out, for they have to pay less now. In this last category we mostly find entrepreneurs and homes with high earnings, who can now eat at the restaurant for less money or hire a cheaper cleaning lady. 
If you think about this, it becomes easier to understand why Dieter Zetsche and other entrepreneurs cheer Angela Merkel, since they expect new workers for their assembly belts, and also why the cultivated bourgeoisie [Bildungsbürgertum] is less opposed to such migration, whereas common workers tend to be more open to the slogans of PEGIDA. It´s not about irrational xenophobia vs. generosity and openness to the world, which can be  celebrated in TV commentary with a self-righteously schoolmarmish tone [oberlehrehaft]. In fact, it´s often self-interest that, consciously or unconsciously, hides behind the façades.
Even though the net effect of migration for the pre-existing population approaches zero, a benefit for Germans can be derived from immigration, since the new migrants end up in the segments of the labour force in which older migrants concentrate, i.e., migrants who have been in the country for longer. If you disregard the income of migrants who have been in the country for longer and you concentrate your wealth analysis on the German population, then you can indeed see a benefit for this population from further migration. 
In technical literature this is called migration added-value [Migrationsmehrwert], and the native [einheimische] population gets it because the new migrants lower the salaries of the migrants who migrated earlier.&quot;
