@Simon_Jester

There is a big difference between a group having more power than their numbers would suggest is fair and only them having power. I see a lot of explicit and implicit claims that it is solely white men who have or had power, which is false.

Secondly, power is contextual and multi-faceted. I see a strong tendency by those who believe in the ideology under discussion to ignore the contexts and facets where white men are or were not so powerful.

Thirdly, I often see power in a certain context be conflated with using that power selfishly. This ignores the existence of altruism, as well as ways in which those who seem (very) powerful are actually restrained and/or directed in how they use that power. It&#039;s a lot less obvious that having disproportionate power equals oppression in general or oppression to the extent that the power is disproportionate, when those who are &#039;in power&#039; are severely constrained, including, for example, being forced into making sacrifices.

Then we haven&#039;t even addressed the issue that these groups that are identified are not exactly homogeneous, including in their (access to) power. The jobless Appalachian white man doesn&#039;t have the same power as the white men or black women who are in congress, nor do his interests naturally align with the latter. Or at least, that is what I believe. Those who strongly believe in &#039;whiteness&#039; seem to believe that Bubba has immense white male privilege and that his interests align more with Bill Clinton than Bill Clinton&#039;s interests align with Barack Obama.]]></description>

Yeah.

The antebellum South actually put a huge amount of effort into making it impossible for blacks- enslaved or free- to organize into any kind of political machinery that might upset the system.

&lt;blockquote&gt;On the definition of whiteness, why would anyone think the modern discourse on this is at all historically reliable? Most people trying to define whiteness are creating an ideological construction with limited ties to reality anyway, with the oppressive white (man) as a key plank. They’re going to manipulate history to support this view, just as any ideological movement does. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Should I be interpreting this passage to say that historically, American society in particular and Western society &lt;i&gt;haven&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; been dominated by individuals who happened to, as a collective body, be male and white?]]></description>

Hypothesis: if you actually take aside a scholar of American race relations who says something like &quot;the concept &#039;whiteness&#039; is defined in opposition to &#039;blackness&#039; and historically grew out of a desire by Anglo-American colonists to separate and distinguish themselves from African slaves and importantly from black freemen,&quot; and ask them the following question:

&quot;So, do you think &#039;whiteness&#039; as Americans understand it was &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; defined in opposition to the Native Americans, or was this irrelevant to the development of the American concept of &#039;whiteness?&#039; &quot;

I think most of the race relations scholars would say &quot;oh yeah, that too, white was totally seen in opposition to both &#039;black&#039; and &#039;red&#039; and tended to define itself as a &#039;pure&#039; absence of either of the above, but with a different relationship to the &#039;reds&#039; than to the &#039;blacks&#039; for various reasons.

It&#039;s not so much that the role of conflict with, and then extermination of, the Native Americans is ignored by &quot;modern racial commentators.&quot; If they&#039;re not talking about it much, it&#039;s because &lt;i&gt;modern&lt;/i&gt; concepts of whiteness aren&#039;t defined in terms of &quot;we&#039;re not a bunch of Injuns,&quot; because Native Americans haven&#039;t been a relevant demographic any meaningful number of Americans felt any fear of since the 1890s.]]></description>

I assume you mean &quot;corporate greed&quot; is more used when there is lots of corporate greed?

Cooperation is different though. Corporate greed is considered bad while cooperation is considered good. When corporate greed is high, people are likely to complain about it. When cooperation is high, people are not likely to complain about the lack of cooperation, nor (I think) are they going to praise themselves over the great amount of cooperation.]]></description>

A Cherokee friend of mine introduced me to the phrase &quot;born Indian, died white&quot;, meaning that lots of Native Americans assimilated, whether intentionally, by force, or just sort of casually (or all of the above in different ways at different times) to the point that when they died, no one made note of their heritage. If no one said anything, &quot;white&quot; might end up on their death certificates, especially if they were mixed race. I can&#039;t imagine this phenomenon is as widespread for other races, and that feels significant but I&#039;m not sure where to go with that.]]></description>

@angularangel

If you have questions about anything that you find unconvincing, feel free to ask--I enjoy the discussion. But if you&#039;re burned out on the topic, I&#039;m not trying to lecture you on terminology or anything. I just think it is an interesting subject. There is literature about this, but I don&#039;t know what the best recs are--here are two I do know about: 

https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/590649?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents

This one deals with the polarization of the Civil War Era v. now:

https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2018/1019/Risk-of-a-new-civil-war-Today-us-and-them-differs-from-1850s

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Even when the parties agree on what to do about a particular national problem, they view each other suspiciously and put winning as a group over all else...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That is what I think is key--you can&#039;t settle anything with partisan polarization. You can settle things under other types--with ruthless finality, often with violence. I think partisan polarization arises naturally from certain large social and technological changes, and that is what has happened here. A change in the level of abstraction results, and a realignment occurs around it. I see it as driven by material conditions that cause predictable behavioral changes. I read a lot of newspapers from the 1860s-1880s, as part of a research project. It is odd to see in real time how the partisanship so easily reasserted dominance after the war in terms of rhetoric and political definition, if not in yet in practice. A shallow, broad, universal vagueness. I&#039;m done now, I promise!]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Arguably therefore increased modern partisanship reflects the availability of more perfect information, whereby it is easier to coordinate punishment of dissenters, and where party adherence is not filtered through local issues but is rather a broad statement of political position, reducing intra-party conflict by ensuring more shared views. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

I agree with this assessment of the dynamic. I don&#039;t think they succeed in harmonizing the dissenters so much as crushing them, though. The lack of filtering through local issues, broad appeal, and organized information used in opposition to dissenters makes politics more abstract. That is what causes the unhealthiness of high partisanship (all conditions have unhealthiness, I&#039;m not saying it is inherently bad, but I think that is what defines it--people begin sounding really irrational in specific ways). You can&#039;t actually make some of the local conflicts unimportant and thus harmonize everyone---you just crush dissent. Things are unrealistically simple and continually purified. 

Where information and coordination is lower, there are many more options among party members and strict partisan lines don&#039;t set the whole playing field. Things can be just as divisive, or more so, but the conflicts are less broad and stream-lined. It is probably somewhat more rational but chaotic and selfish. I think it is a pendulum. Low partisanship often goes with unrest, because pressing, volatile, concrete issues have transcended party.]]></description>

That is what causes the unhealthiness of high partisanship (all conditions have unhealthiness, I&#8217;m not saying it is inherently bad, but I think that is what defines it&#8211;people begin sounding really irrational in specific ways). You can&#8217;t actually make some of the local conflicts unimportant and thus harmonize everyone&#8212;you just crush dissent. Things are unrealistically simple and continually purified. </p>
<p>Where information and coordination is lower, there are many more options among party members and strict partisan lines don&#8217;t set the whole playing field. Things can be just as divisive, or more so, but the conflicts are less broad and stream-lined. It is probably somewhat more rational but chaotic and selfish. I think it is a pendulum. Low partisanship often goes with unrest, because pressing, volatile, concrete issues have transcended party.</p>

Honestly I think the &quot;elite&quot; part may be inaccurate - it&#039;s more about having too much supply vs demand in an employment market. This might mean second and third sons of wealthy farmers (or plantation owners) who won&#039;t inherit the farm but are still looking for a position with decent status, or second and third (and fourth, and bastards) nobles sons, or today&#039;s college graduates, or even working class people who feel they&#039;re being forced into a bad economic bargain, or really any large enough segment of the population that feels they&#039;re getting the short end of the stick and is upset enough about it to rock the boat.]]></description>
