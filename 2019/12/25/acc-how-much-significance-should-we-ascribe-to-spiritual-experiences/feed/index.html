I&#039;ve always been curious about prayer flags and prayer wheels. I know some Buddhists have things akin to the Catholic rosary, where they can keep track of where they are in a practice with a number of elements or repetitions (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_prayer_beads), but prayer flags and prayer wheels seem like something else entirely, notably because you don&#039;t have to mentally interact with the text at all in order to use them! I remember visiting a Buddhist temple in Asia that had a huge prayer wheel on the roof that guests were invited to turn (I think containing the Diamond Sutra or something), but we couldn&#039;t even *see* the text inside, and perhaps a majority of the visitors to that temple had never studied it. That seems like a particular ritual that has a technological or magical element at least because of all of the other experiential elements that it doesn&#039;t include.

I&#039;ve heard the idea that turning a prayer wheel counts as a recitation of the texts inside it, but it&#039;s interesting that this should be so in some sense even for people who aren&#039;t familiar with them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/12/25/acc-how-much-significance-should-we-ascribe-to-spiritual-experiences/#comment-834729&quot;&gt;ReasonableFideist&lt;/a&gt;.

Thank you so much for this detailed response. 

Your kayaking story is a great example of how spiritual experience has utility. I&#039;ve heard so many similar stories of people who inexplicably &quot;knew&quot; that some sort of action would either have profoundly positive or negative effects. This gut feeling/instinct/conscience is a certain type of spiritual epistemology that almost always leads to better outcomes. In the Christian tradition, most of these kinds of experiences would be attributed to the activity of the Holy Spirit. I, too, have had these kinds of experiences, and they are impossible for me to ignore or dismiss. 

You ask a few great questions here: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;One, why do some people have religious experiences and others don’t. Two, why would a “God” create these conditions, rather than just provide objective evidences, or even just show up himself. What interest could he have in hiding himself to some, but revealing himself to others and only in ways that were not provable to those outside the subjective experience?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I think a partial answer to all these questions is to see God as a relational entity. People who have experiences with God are usually those who want them. It&#039;s kind of like how most of us end up being friendly to people who are first friendly to us. That&#039;s not a perfect analogy, but it gets the point across. God responds to people who want to interact with Him. I believe that the nature of spiritual experiences is predicted by two intersecting characterizations of God: 1) He wants a relationship with people. 2) He has given free will to humanity, and he respects that free will. 

In partial answer to the issue of objectivity, you present an idea that the spiritual experiences you have had are the result of your &quot;spiritual work&quot; and that they do not arrive for the purpose of convincing you. This is absolutely in parallel with my own experience. If I put in the time and effort to talk to God, He &quot;talks&quot; back in a multitude of ways (although never audibly). 

I am also curious why God does not seem to present objective. concrete, unmissable evidence of His existence (other than like the vast overwhelming beauty of the universe and the laws of physics, etc.). But perhaps it is because He wants us to come to Him. I love your inclusion of Kierkegaard, whom I greatly admire. Kierkegaard characterized God and the spiritual life as foundationally relational. As you state, the Kierkegaardian conception of belief is not about facts or objectivity, but about a subject-subject relationship in which humanity finds identity in God. 

Again, thank you for your thoughtful response to this piece.]]></description>

Your criticism is absolutely valid. I think it was a case of &quot;sorry this letter is so long, but I didn&#039;t have the time to write a short one.&quot;

My process of writing is to attempt to capture all the relevant details of my research as completely as possible, and then edit from there. We ran out of time to really cut it down. I guess I preferred to let it be overkill, rather than miss an important point.]]></description>

The Seven Secular Sermons blog post was an excellent read. Thanks for sharing!

I can understand why the literature is methodologically agnostic, but after reading this ACC it indeed does seem like a dead end.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve never been convinced by the argument from dreams, to me dreams have always seemed totally categorically different from waking reality, with no chance whatsoever of confusing the two.  

I think when people say &quot;it&#039;s so convincing&quot; they&#039;re just remembering the dream and trying to convince themselves (and us) that it &quot;seems real&quot; just for the sake of the argument.  The only way you could possibly have a thought about the dream (about whether it&#039;s convincing or not) at the time you&#039;re dreaming is if you&#039;re lucid dreaming, but that&#039;s a different experience again, and again, there&#039;s no confusion there either - you&#039;re awake in your dream and you know that you are dreaming.

And funnily enough (quite as per the Yoga categorization) mystical experience, the non-dual kind, is itself another state of experience that&#039;s unmistakable and different from waking or dreaming states (and I&#039;d actually include drug experiences in the category of waking states).  It&#039;s at right angles to both of them.]]></description>

So many people are commenting on the length of this entry as a flaw. Obviously it was intended as a way to symbolically include not only the explicitly discussed Near Death Experiences, but the more common and spiritually significant Near Life Experiences (NLEs) such as high school and SQA meetings. 

(I agree though... come back with some spiritual technology that can extend telomeres, or quit wasting our time ;)]]></description>
