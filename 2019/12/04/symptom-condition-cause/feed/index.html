Followup, having read the book:

It seems like the first straightforward description of dukkha I&#039;ve seen. Like, *extremely* straightforward except that it&#039;s framed as specifically about smoking and nicotine withdrawal, and very obviously extendable to all other addictions based on confusion of different sorts of reinforcement, but with less of a clean &quot;quitting&quot; behavior possible in the general case, since how exactly do I know whether I&#039;ve quit dukkha, when the nature of generalized addictive behavior is to be confused about why you&#039;re doing what you&#039;re doing?

As far as I can tell the rest of his books are kind of crap attempts to translate this insight into other cleanly definable domains.

Carr generated this apparently by just mindfully smoking, and realizing that he was smoking to alleviate vague feelings of dissatisfaction which were making it harder for him to cope with other stuff, and the way smoking &quot;helped&quot; was just by making him less anxious about not getting to smoke.

It makes sense that if addiction to cigarettes is mostly due to confusion, a sufficiently clear and vivid description of exactly what dukkha is and how it works, as applied to the cigarette pattern, would cause the relevant confusions (and therefore strength of addiction) to dissolve.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is one problem with this analysis: Unlike either fluid in the lungs or depression, autism diagnoses are for life. They do not go away when your symptoms go away. I have a very concrete example of this, because my son has a diagnosis of autism which he gained at the age of three due to being

- close to non-verbal
- restricted and repetitive interests
- unusual sensitivity to sound and sensation
- other classic autism markers such as not doing joint attention, or pointing.

We did a shit-ton of early intervention with him. He learned to talk, and right now is in the top 5% of his age group for language skills. Interest in a wide variety of things followed gaining the ability to talk about it. Sensitivity to sound and touch went away by itself. The only remaining &#039;symptom&#039; of his early diagnosis is a tendency to not notice people are talking to him if he&#039;s thinking about something else (and he self-describes as &#039;massive nerd&#039;). There is no way on this planet he would ever receive an ASD diagnosis if he were being tested right now, at age 12.

And yet he still has a diagnosis. Because the theory the diagnosis is based on is that what his autism actually is, is some difference - whatever it is - in his internal brain structure which caused the symptoms in the first place. The theory goes that, just because we did a bunch of work and got rid of the symptoms, doesn&#039;t mean that the whatever-it-is isn&#039;t still there.

Under those circumstances, it makes complete sense to point out that different people who exhibit, or USED to exhibit, different clusters of the sorts of behaviours that might get you an ASD diagnosis, almost certainly have different whatever-it-is&#039;s and therefore it doesn&#039;t make real sense to have that they have the &quot;same thing&quot;. Particularly when different people can have actual opposite symptoms that are counted as contributing to a diagnosis either way (for instance, either tactile hypersensitivity or hyposensitivity; hyperfocus or impulsivity; won&#039;t speak or won&#039;t shut up) and there is no specific core group of symptoms that you have to have for a diagnosis, as long as you have enough of the possible symptoms]]></description>

4 is an appropriate response to 3.

For example, &quot;Let&#039;s discuss the contract&quot; in response to &quot;Crazy weather this week&quot; is a Power Move, asserting dominance and status by breaking the small talk script; doing so is of course simply following a different script, and results in friction when used by someone of insufficient power and status. 

I don&#039;t label most of the nodes in my own map, and I don&#039;t feel like going through the effort to make labels that will be understood by people who deny that there is a territory to map.]]></description>

I was wondering if it was the case that the vast majority of people diagnosed with autism are high-functioning. Well, it appears that some studies find that to be the case, others find the vast majority to be low-functioning, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autism.org.uk/about/what-is/myths-facts-stats.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;averaging across these studies&lt;/a&gt; we can say that low-functioning and high-functioning autistics are about half-and-half. (This is defining low-functioning autism as autism plus IQ less than 70.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/12/04/symptom-condition-cause/#comment-827734&quot;&gt;Doesntliketocomment&lt;/a&gt;.

To give you an example from a popular movie, Fight Club.  The protagonist is being fired.  Most people have a limited selection of &quot;scripts&quot; in this situation:

1) Beg for their job.
OR
2) Gracefully accept termination.

Our protagonist, however, is obviously a very enlightened rationalist who realizes that he has more options available to him than just the limited range of scripts.  For example, he can:

3) Beat himself up, accuse his boss of doing it, and threaten to sue the company, eventually ending up with a large cash settlement.

This is a perfect example of &quot;going off-script.&quot;  Scripts are essentially a set of behavioral expectations created by the cultural norms of society.  When none of the pre-existing scripts lead you to a desirable end-state, you can simply tear up the rules and write a new script for yourself, which may or may not have better end results.  Most people don&#039;t think of this, since they are so conditioned by cultural norms that they don&#039;t realize that stepping outside of those boundaries is an option, or that there is no benefit to obeying a cultural norm if it is disadvantageous or discriminatory against you.  Why play by the rules if the game is rigged against you from the start?

Another example is the French Revolution.  When dealing with an oppressive class of elites, the script for the underclass is usually:

1) Guilt trip them into giving you fairer treatment,
OR
2) Unionize for better wages

However, the French people decided to go &quot;off-script&quot; and choose a different option:

3) Kill everybody in the elite upper classes, take their stuff, install a new government of demagogues, inexplicably change your calendar, and make lots of questionable choices in your first carefree flirtation with sexy sexy democracy.

Obviously going off-script doesn&#039;t ALWAYS lead to good results, but it&#039;s important to remember that you always have the OPTION of going off-script if the outcome of an existing script is undesirable to you.  Making it clear to others that you are willing to go off-script can also be a useful negotiating tactic.  For example, if the french nobility had realized that the peasantry were willing to go off-script, Marie Antoinette might have been a bit less cavalier with her remarks about eating cake.

Generally speaking, the smarter and more resourceful you are, the more opportunities you have to go off-script, or to write your own scripts which you then propagate to the rest of society.]]></description>
