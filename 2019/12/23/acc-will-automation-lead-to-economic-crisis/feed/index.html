					<description><![CDATA[The supposed &quot;stagnation&quot; of income since 1975 is one of those Big Lies.

Income has approximately doubled in real terms since 1975.

This is obvious if you look at literally anything. Houses have gotten almost 1000 square feet bigger, and have vastly more and better creature comforts - AC, central heating, no lead paint, better insulation, wired for internet access, ect. And at the same time, cars have gotten vastly better, people have twice as many TVs per household, and we have vast numbers of things that people lacked in 1975 - better health care, computers, cell phones, smart phones, internet access, VHS, DVDs, video on demand, satellite TV, streaming, ect.

Once you realize that is obviously all impossible if people haven&#039;t gotten any richer, you realize that the actual answer is that the claims are just the result of pure manipulation by monstrously evil people for political gain.

CPI (the inflationary statistic they&#039;re using in the graph) itself is pretty useless; it overestimates inflation by more than 1% per year, which is a cumulative effect which obviously is going to make the number wrong. The opposition to moving to a more accurate inflationary statistic is political; beyond the fact that it would undermine all the claims of the far left, it would also mean that various agencies and other programs have had their funding grow much faster than inflation, as the &quot;automatic&quot; inflationary adjustments have actually given people more money than they should have.

But it also ignores the fact that non-wage compensation (which is also paid for by employers) has grown vastly since 1975 - in fact, it has grown much faster than wages have.

Once you realize that the &quot;disconnect&quot; graph is just a flat-out lie, you stop having to make excuses for why people have so much more stuff and such a higher standard of living despite their income supposedly not having grown.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think that nobody is talking about a big issue - that the growth of the ratio [total production]/[total employment] is at historically LOWER levels, exactly the opposite of what should be expected if there is a big automation going on.

My guess is that most of the automation are occurring not at production level, but at consumer level - not machines used in factories or even offices, but more gadgets that people use at home (like smartphones).]]></description>

Well said. I agree with pretty much all of this. I would love to work 20 hours a week, and I could comfortably survive and save on it if I got anything like the hourly rate I could expect on a full-time job with my skills. But the jobs just don&#039;t exist. If I want to work 20 hours a week, I&#039;m doing something (a) less interesting and (b) much lower pay. It seems to me that one of the great challenges of the 21st century is to get us all working less hard and having a bit of leisure time for once.

And I&#039;m in Europe. I understand it&#039;s much worse in the US.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Minor pedantic point: &quot;So we know from experience that employment is able to adapt to extensive automation. However, these changes took place over millennia, centuries and decades respectively.&quot;

This is an incorrect use of &quot;respectively&quot;. It should be used when there is a list of things that each corresponds to a particular one in another list of things, not just plonked on the end of a list of things. It tripped me up when reading it, because I assumed I&#039;d misread something, and that you were saying one type of change took place over millennia, another took place over centuries, and a third took place over decades. So I went back and read the sentence twice more to clarify. The sentence would make perfect sense if you just removed the word &quot;respectively&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This write-up&#039;s points seem cogent and well-supported and I was persuaded that automation is unlikely to cause economic crisis. But I&#039;m probably an easy audience for this because I believe the pace of automation will be slower than expected. (Main reason: Designing &#038; building robots is still very expensive relative to human labor, we shouldn&#039;t expect *that* to get much cheaper because it&#039;s skill-intensive and capital-intensive, and if it gets significantly automated then there are good reasons to believe we&#039;re close to the Singularity anyway.) My main reservations are:
- I can&#039;t tell how energetically the other collaborator (Doug Summers-Stay) was opposing this conclusion
- Not much attempt at rigorous or numeric analysis, even to the point of estimating probabilities or laying out scenarios
- Narrow definition of &quot;economic crisis&quot; that boils down to framing it almost entirely in terms of GDP. Structural unemployment due to rapid automation and out-of-control disparity of incomes can&#039;t be dismissed as forms of economic crisis.

This was a shorter entry that reached clear, solid conclusions with well-written arguments and lots of pretty graphs. Maybe I&#039;m looking a gift horse in the mouth here, since I dinged other entries for being wishy-washy, but unless it&#039;s clear what arguments and counter-arguments were considered I have trouble distinguishing this from a FAQ-type document that takes a specific point of view. The reliance on analogies and thought experiments exacerbated this problem. So I didn&#039;t get the kind of content from this write-up that would make the adversarial-collaboration aspect worthwhile.

I rate this collaboration as a 7/10 (no particular scale or judgment implied; this is just for my own reference). As always, many thanks to the authors for putting in the work to create this.]]></description>

Scott did a whole post on this. It definitely should at least include a caveat that the chart is hotly contested. Most people find that when using the appropriate inflation measures, etc., compensation has increased a lot more than 9% in real terms since 1975]]></description>
