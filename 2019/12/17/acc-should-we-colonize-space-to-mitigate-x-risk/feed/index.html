Humanity as we know it is the only vaguely plausible mechanism to create gods-worthy-of-the-name (not demons-worthy-of-the-name, or blahs-worthy-of-the-name), as well as preserve all life in the universe (or at least continue the line of meaning for the struggles of that life), and/or create new universes friendly to life (of any kind, not just as we know it).

Is a truly loving, caring, wise, and good-intentioned God not worth saving?

Given these plausible truths, I am curious to know why you think humanity is not worth saving, and why you added the qualifier &quot;as a whole&quot;.]]></description>

I agree that keeping people out is physically possible, but it&#039;s probably not politically possible in a lot of scenarios.

If you locate your terrestrial lifeboat inside an existing country, you will be bound by its laws, which will include allowing people entry.  Yes, even if it is private property.

If you aren&#039;t in an existing country, you are creating your own country.  I know you mentioned the North Pole as an example.  Even if you&#039;re allowed to settle there (and you probably won&#039;t be), it will get complicated fast.  You will basically be part of great power politics.

In many cases, neutrality is not really an option.  For example, if you are on friendly terms with Putin&#039;s Russia, you almost certainly can&#039;t also be on friendly terms with the United States.  And you need to be on friendly terms with somebody to get access to financial markets, goods and supplies, colonists, etc.  But if you&#039;re in the US camp, why wouldn&#039;t Putin target an ICBM at you for when the SHTF?

Space colonies avoid most of these issues because they are truly cut off from Earth-- militarily and economically.]]></description>

You won&#039;t be mobbed if you build it in central antartica, or on rockall, or somewhere else that Joe Bloggs can&#039;t get to. To stop any visitors being a problem, a really solid door and lock is recommended. Medieval castles used boiling oil to deter unwanted guests. Any of this getting built depends on a lot of people caring about X risk. If they don&#039;t care enough to put in an air system, they don&#039;t care enough to do the other things either and they are just regular builders.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Overall, a planetary system of lifeboats would be able to survive anything an offworld colony would survive, outside of a rogue AI or grey goo scenario.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I would expect an off world colony to survive a grey goo event. Grey goo being dumb but very effective replicators, and basically being something that couldn&#039;t happen by accident, and would take significantly more expertise to build than Drexler style nanotech. I don&#039;t think an of world colony would survive rouge AI. The colony will probably have a radio receiver, and the AI will beam itself across. Otherwise, the AI will build a rocket. Mars is made of atoms that could be paperclips too.]]></description>

Thanks to everyone for contributing your perspectives for me on why we should try to avoid extinction, I appreciate it. I see I am in a minority in my viewpoint that non-human animals and possibly the biosphere of Earth itself constitute sentient beings with a value potentially equal to the value of human sentience. I see no way to disprove this from my own limited vantage point. The beauty and grace of the natural world absent human intervention seems inherently valuable. I don&#039;t think that human intelligence and enjoyment is necessarily the highest good in the universe. It could be, but my perspective on this is necessarily biased by my human viewpoint. Even if human intelligence is the apex of intelligence, is our experience then necessarily more valuable than the experiences of thousands of other species all facing extinction because of our actions? Maybe, but why? It could simply be our bias that makes us think that our type of conscious experience is &quot;richer&quot; or more valuable. Who knows what goes on in the minds of dolphins or apes or whales? And drawing on the ideas of the prior AC re: vegetarianism and the relative weights of conscious experience for non-human animals, would the richness of the human conscious experience alone outweigh the value of all the non-human experiences, in their combined variety, which will be lost forever in the current human created mass extinction? Should we strive to unleash this killing power to the rest of the universe, where there are potentially other biospheres with their own rich tapestries of consciousness which we could destroy by using them for our own purposes like we are doing here? To me, there is not enough evidence that we are worthy, as a species, of inflicting that kind of risk on the rest of the universe, whatever it turns out to contain. 

I appreciate that we are tribal primates programmed to want to survive and to me that seems the most honest reason to support the premise, though I don&#039;t think it holds much ethical weight on a rational level. I&#039;m not in favor of going extinct, but I don&#039;t think we are so special that it would be a tragedy to anyone other than ourselves if we do, and I suspect it would open up possibilities for richness and beauty which are currently foreclosed by human domination of the planet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think people are way too optimistic about the potential for &quot;terrestrial lifeboats&quot; to succeed.  If the lifeboat isn&#039;t secret, it will be mobbed by people trying to get in as soon as whatever bad event you&#039;re trying to protect against happens.  People are not just going to stand politely outside and die for the good of the species.

But keeping the lifeboat secret is a nearly impossible task.  Basically you need to have a group of people living cut off from the world for generations with nobody giving away the secret.

There is also a strong temptation for anyone on Earth to use the resources that Earth provides.  For example, why not use the regular air supply rather than creating a closed air system?  It&#039;s so much easier-- and in the short term, safer.  But in the long term, it could make the lifeboat useless if the atmosphere gets poisoned.

So the whole terrestrial lifeboat thing is kind of like the people who say they could get an MIT-equivalent education with just their library card.  Sure you could, buddy.  In theory.  In practice, after a few months, you&#039;re going to be sitting on your couch playing XBox for 8 hours a day because the environment around you is not keeping you focused.]]></description>

I may be in the minority here, but I consider insulation from memes (broadly defined) to be a non-negligible X-risk-style benefit of the closed-system colonies being considered.

Not quite the same as what you&#039;re describing but my hunch is that geographical &quot;separatism&quot; won&#039;t cut it anymore given the Internet&#039;s effect on culture / politics.]]></description>
