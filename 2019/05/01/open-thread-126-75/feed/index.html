&lt;blockquote&gt; Couldn’t HBO make more money by stretching things out for a full length season or two?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This assumes that they can generate enough quality material to keep viewers hooked. Given than in this last season of 6 episodes, the first 2 are mostly filler, I doubt so. You can only have so many scenes of characters drinking and cracking sex jokes before the viewers give up.]]></description>

Indeed Sam is smart in the sense a stereotypical nerd is smart: good at technical stuff but with horrible social skills, completely unsuitable for politics. Another example is Qyburn.

Contrast with Tyrion, Tywin, Littlefinger, Varys or even Maester Pycelle who used to conspire all day long. Except for the unballed one, these are all dead or reduced to cute little mascots.]]></description>

John Schilling-

That would indeed have been stellar.

But I&#039;ve always thought the dirty-faced flowermonger Eliza Doolittle was way prettier than the belle-of-the-ball Eliza Doolittle. It would be really tough to pull it off.]]></description>

Oh, I didn&#039;t realize he was behind TAS. I do have to look into that.

I do kind of regret not living in the alternate universe where Warner et al said, &quot;OK, so Emma is growing into gorgeous - &lt;i&gt;how do we hide that until the Yule Ball scene&lt;/i&gt;?&quot; and somehow pulled it off.]]></description>

Yeah, it confuses me too. Even if GoT is just the enticement that makes people sign up and forget to cancel, it works better if it&#039;s more enticing.

There are limits to how long you can stretch it out. I read all the books, and have to say I think GRRM went off on a lot of tangents that weren&#039;t really all that interesting. Hmm. I wonder if the explanation for both might be that he just never came up with a resolution that he really liked.

There are lots of gaudy potboilers on cable that are what you might call &quot;situation dramas&quot;, where the setup is to watch the characters deal with whatever is thrown at them and you can watch it forever without ever tying everything up in a nice bow. But this is not that kind of story.]]></description>

I mean the last episode showed that Winterfell has a Starbucks branch so a detonator isn&#039;t totally out of place...

Seriously though, they seem to have forgotten about Wildfire and Cercei&#039;s borderline-pyromaniacal obsession with it. 

It&#039;s been a while since she blew up the Sept of Balor: even with their Game of Thrones jetpacks the characters have to have spent at least a month in transit. That&#039;s more than enough time to make a cache of Wildfire and store it under the Red Keep as a trap for anyone dumb enough to fly her dragon into stone-melting range.]]></description>

In Goblet of Fire, where Krum invites Hermione to the ball, and she dresses up, she becomes quite attractive even in the book.

So Hermione Granger was never a hideously ugly character, just a geek girl who doesn&#039;t care much about her appearance.]]></description>

I am open to marrying religious non-Spanish people, but not religious Spaniards (as opposed to Basques/Catalans), because we would have a clash of a lot of identity issues (such as teaching our children Basque also), that I wouldn&#039;t have with a foreigner. 

The Spanish extreme right is also deeply nationalistic, and they deny my identity, my feelings, and my ancestry as a Basque. That is too large a divide to cross.]]></description>
