					<description><![CDATA[I would just like to say thanks for linking to John Salvatier&#039;s blog post (Reality has a surprising amount of detail).  As an engineer by training and trade, that boiling water example hits home for me.  I often feel like the point he is trying to make is not well enough appreciated by many people, so I&#039;m glad to see it get some exposure here.

Edit: Reading a bit further, it seems like this post is touching upon some of the same themes, if not the same particular message.]]></description>

England&#039;s 350 years of peaceful power transfers, I suppose.
Governments are better managed today than they were 200 years ago. Organizational science, I think, is an improvement on Aristotle&#039;s &lt;i&gt;Politics.&lt;/i&gt;]]></description>

Logged in to say this is a great comment. I hadn&#039;t even considered that dogs and cats might be able to &quot;notice confusion&quot; and become relieved by understanding (even though a cat&#039;s trademark attribute is curiosity!), even though my pets have definitely exhibited that kind of behavior.

It suggests that (obvious though it may seem when said explicitly) an animal&#039;s &lt;i&gt;desire&lt;/i&gt; to understand is not necessarily correlated to its actual &lt;i&gt;ability&lt;/i&gt; to understand, and that the neural structures that cause this are far older than the primate family (otherwise cats and dogs wouldn&#039;t have them).]]></description>

Eli beat me to it, but to echo them: the second law is a situation where the &quot;end state&quot; is a product of the application of some surprisingly simple mathematical models applied rigorously*. This is not an example of a system where indeterminate mechanisms lead to predetermined outcomes. Do you have any better examples?

* Depending on your preferred thermodynamic model, you can actually derive 2nd law behavior from entirely different premises. Independently, it can be distilled to either &quot;combinatoric growth is &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; fast&quot; or &quot;there&#039;s no such thing as the opposite of random&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Has anyone engaged David Deutsch on the subject of Kuhn?  He has the best critique of Kuhn I&#039;ve yet seen in Ch 13 of his The Fabric of Reality, which I won&#039;t retail here not so much because it is too involved, but because in various ways the whole book leads up to it.  I despair of synopsis, therefore the general inquiry.

I find Deutsch exasperating (my fault, not his) because even when I&#039;m pretty sure he&#039;s wrong, I usually can&#039;t marshal a good counter-argument.  So I seek help on this wherever I turn.

Full disclosure, I buy the Many-Worlds &quot;interpretation&quot; of quantum mechanics, just as I buy the dinosaur &quot;interpretation&quot; of fossils.  I&#039;m no huge fan of Yudkowski, but I agree on this.  Sure there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2014/06/30/why-the-many-worlds-formulation-of-quantum-mechanics-is-probably-correct/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;problems&lt;/a&gt;, so let&#039;s address them instead of ignoring/stonewalling the issue.  I know a bunch of physicists, including a couple of regulars at CERN, who are willing to discuss physics with me (especially after a few drinks). If only in a isn&#039;t-that-cute-a-guy-without-a-physics-PhD-wants-to-talk-physics kind of way.  Anything from dark matter to muon tomography. But raise Many-Worlds or any challenge to the Copenhagen Interpretation and it all shuts down, can&#039;t get anything out of them but straight down the line Bohrian Complementarity/shut-up-and-calculate. 

But even though I generally am persuaded by Deutsch re physics, I have difficulty accepting a lot of his philosophical positions, especially his radical optimism.  Input would be welcome, and a bite-sized place to start would be Deutsch&#039;s critique of Kuhn.  I realize that I am assuming (and then some) that someone among SSC&#039;s commentariat has read Deutsch&#039;s book(s) and is willing to post something about it, but I take crazy chances the way.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sometimes it seems impossible to translate a single fact and poor translations lead to apparent contradictions. It seems that people have to learn the new paradigm, like a new language, for basic propositions to be coherent and integrate with other knowledge.

Also, we can’t have facts independent of paradigms any more than we can have sentences independent of languages.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And yet, as we know from programming languages, what&#039;s expressible (in principle) in one sufficiently powerful language is expressible (in principle, not necessarily with any convenience) in all of them.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Drawing a line between explanations that use that sort of claim and explanations that appeal to, say, the second law of thermodynamics is tricky to say the least.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Except that the second law of thermodynamics simply says: the total entropy, measured globally, of a closed system will tend to increase, precisely because, by definition, there are more ways for it to do so than not.

Things don&#039;t &quot;gravitate&quot; to increasing entropy.  There are just more ways for entropy to increase than decrease, so on average, it increases.

Note that many interpretations of Second Law-style fluctuation theorems for open systems actually come to opposed conclusions: an open system which &lt;i&gt;predicts&lt;/i&gt;, can in fact act as an &quot;entropy pump&quot; that concentrates negentropy locally as a method of increasing entropy globally.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;In conclusion, all of this is about predictive coding.

It’s the same thing. Perception getting guided equally by top-down expectations and bottom-up evidence. Oh, I know what you’re thinking. “There goes Scott again, seeing predictive coding in everything”. And yes. But also, Kuhn does everything short of come out and say “When you guys get around to inventing predictive coding, make sure to notice that’s what I was getting at this whole time.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
If you ever wanna do research instead of clinical work, give me an email, and maybe we could find something for a psychiatrist to do in our predictive coding of emotions lab!]]></description>
