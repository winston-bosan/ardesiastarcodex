I&#039;m an interested skeptic on the Integrated Information Theory approach.

Calculating even magnitude estimates for values for the IIT Phi of human brain is of course computationally intractable. 

I had heard the example of an ornate analogue audio amplifier and guitar wah-wah pedal with feedback having what seems like an absurdly high Phi. I had guessed that even this apparently anomalous example would still be way below a human brain, but don&#039;t have a good sense of that.

I&#039;m sure there are other edge-cases of IIT that disagree with our intuition of what conscious processing might be. Still, IIT might be a fruitful way of attempting to get some grip on investigating consciousness.


Your blu-ray example is interesting to me!
Why would a playing a blu-ray disc have a high Phi? I would have interpreted the &quot;information&quot; in nodes is fixed, in the 25 GB on the disc. The information is read from the disc, and decoded though a fixed algorithm, and pixel changes are sent to the screen. Since this is the end of a shallow cause-effect repertoire tree, with no feedback, I would have guessed the Phi would be fairly low.

Can you share why you think the blu-ray Phi might be high?

If I recall correctly, Christof Koch gave an example of a Turing type machine reading petabytes of tape, and writing the same (or trivially modified) to another tape. Despite the petabytes, the IIT Phi here would still be low-to-zero here.]]></description>

As far as I understand, yes. He started out by assuming that the Philosopher&#039;s Stone was somehow possible (despite zero evidence to the contrary), and set out to discover/create one. By contrast, he also noticed (and/or read) that the celestial and earthly bodies moved in a certain way, and tried to figure out why that was. These two processes are almost exact opposites of each other. The fact that his alchemical studies &quot;shed no light on the relevant laws of nature&quot; is not a bug -- instead, it is a failure mode of the faith-based process.

And on a sidenote: yes, I understand that technically the very notions of &quot;process&quot;, &quot;evidence&quot;, and &quot;difference&quot; could be called &quot;foundational concepts&quot;; but if you follow down that road, you end up in a place where nothing is real, people argue over what the meaning of &quot;is&quot; is, and nothing useful generally gets done.]]></description>

If you have a body of doctrine that is internally incoherent, and tell a lot of people that they are supposed to believe it, then you should expect (1) that lots of people will decline to do so and (2) that many of them will do so in similar ways (attempting to change as little as possible while restoring coherence).

The self-contradiction you profess to find in criticisms of Christianity is (in this instance) largely imagined. In particular, when Bugmaster said &quot;without rhyme, reason, or resolution&quot;, I don&#039;t think he intended to assert that there are no patterns at all in which heresies crop up. (If he did, then he was wrong, and I expect that on reflection he will agree that he was wrong.)

The fact that heresies keep popping up is evidence that Christianity is wrong, but not terribly strong evidence. What it is quite strong evidence for is the point Bugmaster was actually making, namely that it is &lt;i&gt;not very well anchored to reality&lt;/i&gt;: if two variants of Christianity arise, the means for determining which is more correct are rather poor. Of course this state of affairs is quite compatible with Christianity being &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt;: it&#039;s what would happen, e.g., if a benevolent god handed out some revelations, accurate but incomplete and liable to misinterpretation, and then withdrew and declined to offer any clarifications or corrections no matter what the human race did with those revelations.]]></description>

But did he follow a different process for alchemy?  If we had asked him, would he agree that he was following a different process?  We recognize the process as different, but is that just because his foundational concepts were so far from modeling reality that his experiments shed no light on the relevant laws of nature?]]></description>

Right, but like I said, you don&#039;t even need the full Newtonian mechanics; you just need to know the acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the Earth (which you assume to be flat, implicitly). You don&#039;t even need to use calculus (explicitly, that is).]]></description>

If you are designing a trebuchet from scratch, the critical point isn&#039;t the shape of the Earth. It&#039;s a good enough feel for (Newtonian) mechanics to realize that the maximum range, velocity held constant, is at an angle of 45°, but the maximum velocity is with the arm vertical (because that&#039;s the minimum potential energy of the counterweight), so you need a sling designed to let you have both at the same time.]]></description>

Like I said above, it&#039;s the process you follow that gives you predictive power, not just raw intelligence. Newton utterly failed in his alchemical endeavours, for this very reason; and he succeeded at his scientific research for that same reason.

That said though, modern scientists are more likely to be non-religious than non-scientists; and of those scientists who are religious, most are of the &quot;there might be a God be he/she/it is this complex metaphysical quasi-entity&quot; flavor, not of the &quot;the Earth is 6000 years old and you will BURN in HELL for eating SHRIMP !!11!&quot; flavor. There could be multiple reasons for this, but one of the reasons, IMO, is religious faith. Science is all about answering questions; but faith tends to provide ready-made answers while at the same time forbidding inquiry into certain topics. This is why, IIRC, Newton (or maybe it was someone else, I forget) did not bother investigating how the Sun, the Earth, and all the other planets came to be -- because &quot;God ordained it so&quot; was enough of an explanation.]]></description>

Yes, I agree, historically trebuchets were more art than science; I just used them as a convenient illustration. I was thinking of how a modern person might approach building one, not how medieval people were actually building them, historically speaking.]]></description>

Once again, I don&#039;t see the difference between &quot;geometric intuition&quot; and &quot;a model of reality based on math&quot; (as long as you count geometry as being part of math, which I do). I understand that you could say, &quot;deep down, reality is made up of particles&quot;; then someone else comes along and says, &quot;actually, it&#039;s quantum probability packets&quot;. Yes, these are two different models, and one of them is more accurate; however, I don&#039;t think this fact is particularly earth-shattering. Models improve as we gather more data. Unless, perhaps, the second guy is claiming &quot;yes, it&#039;s quantum probability and that&#039;s it, I&#039;ve now devised the 100% perfectly accurate model of reality which can never be improved upon&quot;. In that case, yes, such a statement would be earth-shattering... if it were true.]]></description>
