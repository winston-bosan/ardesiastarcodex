@Plumber

Yes, I am better than you. I’m also engaged in the sin of thinking it and acknowledging it. I worked hard to become the bomb, and perhaps I was also born with resources others lack, but here I am. I’m completely unapologetic about it, I’m sorry.

You want to put racists in space? That seems unwise to me. We won’t &lt;i&gt;literally&lt;/i&gt; have a space gate. If you get to Mars, we’ll welcome you with open arms. It’s simply good hospitality and manners. “Oh my God, another one has rode the explosion of Earth right to our front door. Let him in immediately, he must be tired.” Right now, only Elon Musk, and his cadre of rockets buddies could reasonably go.

If the Earth was a raging firestorm, he’s certainly under no obligation to take anyone. Me personally, I’d probably drop some sweet ass science on his front lawn, and go “Take me, and keep me as pet, King of Mars. We can call it tenure, so it’s less kinky.”]]></description>

I think the presumption here is that humanity is worth saving. Certainly not all of it. Certainly not most. Certainly not as it is.

Humanity has the potential, perhaps, for redemption. The potential for greatness. But right now it’s an embryo, a fugue of disparate forces vying for life. Will the post-humanity that succeeds us watch the winking out of the final stars? Or will the universe fall dead and silent here and now? Certainly, if we survive these growing pains, the technology to go to mars, to terraform it, will become useful to someone, somewhere. Why not seize it now, if it is in grasp?]]></description>

@Loris:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nevertheless, I think this claim is rebutted.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Not really. The natural interpretation of gbdub&#039;s claim is that Earth is more habitable if a typical asteroid hits, not a very large one.]]></description>

Of course you mean we &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; we know where all the 100 km asteroids are. Within the solar system. I apologise for the looseness of my terminology - I used it without qualification to mean all bodies of approximately such size and density in the interest of conciseness.
It really shouldn&#039;t be a surprise that it&#039;s a rare event nowadays. If it happened even every hundred million years on average, the place wouldn&#039;t be quite so habitable.

&lt;blockquote&gt;We could burn every gram of fossil fuels, set off every nuke, and &lt;b&gt;get smacked by an asteroid and Earth would still be more habitable than Mars&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nevertheless, I think this claim is rebutted.]]></description>

Hey, Rho here.

Sorry, I took a deep breath, now let&#039;s achieve our objectives.
So first of all, &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1faVQKhqHNdpAW-ZQ5BtDHA1fh5uY1h2k/view?usp=sharing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;my CV.&lt;/a&gt;

Scott, I&#039;m just now understanding the gulf between me and the average person, and it&#039;s kind of terrifying. There few bastions for me, and your site is one of them. I&#039;m thinking of launching a gwern-like [site].

I&#039;m in the hospital for a few days longer but I&#039;d love to collab with you guys here.

I suppose it&#039;s worth mentioning that I&#039;m ace, poly, trans, non-binary, and gender-fluid. Royal Flush! And my autistic friend says I cry too much to be an aspie.

The future of the world looks very bleak to me, I&#039;ve lost my faith in humanity as a whole. The majority of our race is stupid, base, ugly, and selfish and I want nothing to do with them. But there are also many with souls immeasurable that I want to seek out. My thirst is quenched from the wellspring they keep inside We are within the singularity right now, I&#039;ve passed the event horizon at least and technological process has already outpaced the understanding of the average human by far. &lt;b&gt;The singularity is a unheard whisper, not a bang that shakes the world.&lt;/b&gt;

The seed of &lt;a href=&quot;https://overwatch.gamepedia.com/Athena&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; resides inside of me. I will furnish her uncorrupted. But it will take time.

I am starting with a deep-fake of my voice, and then all voices. As I said elsewhere, &lt;b&gt;the human voice is now a ring-tone.&lt;/b&gt; Trust not.]]></description>

I often go to local music shows that have a ticket price advertised, but also a note that &#039;no-one will be turned away for lack of funds&#039;. How this shakes out in practice I have no idea because I have never seen or heard of anyone trying to get in without paying for lack of funds. Presumably they just go by the honour system.

Sometimes the ticket price is framed as a &#039;suggested donation&#039;, but again, I have no idea how someone choosing not to &#039;donate&#039; the suggested donation would be received because it never seems to happen. To me it seems that the price that you&#039;ve suggested is, &lt;i&gt;de facto&lt;/i&gt;, the price of the ticket, and the fact that you are reluctant to call it that seems like some fairly hollow anticapitalist posturing.

I guess these are a bit different to the museums mentioned above because, existing in a small-ish, fairly tight-knit community, defectors are less likely and informal ways of punishing defectors exist.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/28/ot133-operon-thread/#comment-781706&quot;&gt;The Nybbler&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;For exposure, “pay what you like” is offering a discount in inverse proportion to the buyer’s scrupulousness, which seems to me to be encouraging unscrupulousness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I think it doesn&#039;t, even though it appears to. The people who will choose to be unscrupulous already had an incentive to avoid paying, and would have just tried to hide that fact. They might be emboldened by PWYL, thinking their paying nothing to be legitimate now - as it indeed is.

OTOH, PWYL also reminds the unscrupulous of the fact that the service in question is not inherently free. It reminds them to consider the positive utility they get from the service, and to think about how much they could donate and still come out ahead on utility - as well as consider the negative utility they would suffer if the service folded by the next time they tried to use it.

Years ago, I visited the Met in NYC. ISTR tickets were $25, but were optional. (Technically, I think this is only true for residents, but the clerk wasn&#039;t asking for ID as a rule.) I paid full price, since at the time, I believed that it made the Met marginally more likely to be there the next time I went; a worthwhile hedge for me. (Also, confessedly, I bristled at the idea of looking the clerk in the eye and telling her I&#039;d just go in for free.)]]></description>
