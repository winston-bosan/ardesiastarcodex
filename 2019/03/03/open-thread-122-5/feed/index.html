&lt;code&gt;@&lt;b&gt;Guy in TN&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;
&quot;I do indeed think the welfare state is worth it. Much of the things that have made my life better (schools, roads, parks, funding of research, ect) I could never have paid for by myself. The amount I pay in taxes is far too small to ever purchase such items on the market.

And I’m one of the people who can currently work. If you can’t work (disabled, elderly, children) then you have no hope of receiving income on the labor market. I don’t think we should design our economic institutions to exclude allocating wealth to such people&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

+1 

Thank you Guy in TN!

I very much &lt;i&gt;like &lt;/i&gt; having public bridges, fire fighters, libraries, police, roads, and sewer systems, and wanting to replace &quot;one person, one vote&quot; with &quot;one gold piece, one vote&quot; seems strange to me.

I get that libertarians don&#039;t like the coercive aspect of the modern state, but trading in getting bossed by the police (when at least I have &lt;b&gt;some &lt;/b&gt; say on what the laws are) for getting bossed by the hired goons of the local &quot;ring-giver&quot; land lord/tycoon/warlord seems a bad deal to me.

But the choice isn&#039;t between Somalia and the Soviet Union anyway - Canada, for example, seems pretty nice.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;its very hard to imagine that in our society, you could make the 1% own 37% and not end up with the 99% being a net-drain on the government budget&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No it isn&#039;t as the 99% - 1% divide isn&#039;t static and the bottom 99% aren&#039;t homogeneous.  It is very difficult to claim that the 90-99th percentile in income earners are a net drain on the government, nor the 80-90th.  Something like 70% of the US (not sure if individuals or families) will spend at least a year in the top 20% of income.]]></description>

At only a slight tangent ...

Guy in TN, and perhaps others in this discussion, are assuming that the measure of what you contribute to the system is taxes paid in. That&#039;s too simple, because taxing something alters its price, which affects people consuming it.

For a simple example, suppose the supply of something is perfectly elastic--if it sells for $10/lb, producers will produce as much as anyone wants, at any lower price nothing. You impose a $1/lb tax on it. The price rises to $11/lb, because at any lower price none is produced. All the money is being paid in by the producers, but the cost is being born by the consumers.

Most goods and services we consume are in neither perfectly elastic nor perfectly inelastic supply, so in practice if you tax something, part of the cost is born by producers, part by consumers. The division doesn&#039;t depend on which of them actually hands the money over.]]></description>

So, I misspoke when I typed that &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt; of the 99% are a drain. I meant to say that &lt;i&gt;most&lt;/i&gt; of the 99% are a drain on the system (in line with my original response to Paul), but clearly in my quote, I mistakenly upped that number. This is my bad.

&lt;blockquote&gt;And if, in fact, you are a net drain on “the system”, most of your fellow 99% are not.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is just an empirical question. We can answer this: does &#062;50% of U.S. citizens pay less in taxes than they receive in benefits? The only sticking point I see is how to quantify non-monetary benefits (schools, roads, ect) in dollars, since we can&#039;t say, for instance, what buying military defense would cost on the market exactly.

Some quick googling tells me that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/tcja-increasing-share-households-paying-no-federal-income-tax&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;44% of all people don&#039;t pay any income taxes&lt;/a&gt;. Now granted, that&#039;s not the only one tax, but its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/taxes/how-much-do-americans-really-pay-taxes-2015/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;by far the biggest&lt;/a&gt;.

Some back of the napkins calculations on benefits: the transportation budget for the U.S. government in 2014 was $416 billion. Divide that by 319 millions people, at you get $1,300 per person. On transportation alone! That essentially negates the average sales tax in many cities, and we havn&#039;t even touched all other other benefits.

I am just not seeing how we could keep this number under the 50% mark...]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is all such a bizarre tangent to me. Of course you have to set up your welfare system such that, if it is to be sustainable over the long term, its takes in more than it pays out.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes, and the point is that given the stated goals of many politicians that will not be the case long term. The people in the middle will be discouraged from work, thus discouraging pay in and encouraging them into the pay out class. The people at the bottom will get a large influx of unearned resources, discouraging any incentive to become pay in. That is why most EU welfare states are funded with VATs, which are just universal flat taxes. Taxing the rich has never been effective because they are rare and have much less money than most people imagine. 

While most narratives center around the top 1% vs. the bottom 50%, the reality of economics is about the 40-60% vs. the 0-20% and which norm will prevail. Most people work for minor incremental improvements to their lives and the lives of their children/grandchildren. For a guy earning 40k a year the extra 5% in taxes and extra 5% in benefits is often very meaningful.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;The only way you get the 99% being a “drain on the system” is if you are using the government to progressively tax the rich and use their money to provide services to the poor.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Given that we live in a government that has the norms of progressive taxation, welfare spending, and democratic rule, its very hard to imagine that in &lt;i&gt;our society&lt;/i&gt;, you could make the 1% own 37% and not end up with the 99% being a net-drain on the government budget. Like I said earlier, the &quot;99% will be a drain&quot; is not intended to be a universal economic rule, but in relation to the system we have today.

&lt;blockquote&gt;You can’t simply assert that the existence of a wealthy elite makes everyone else a “net drain on the system”, for either the whole-economy or tax-and-spend definition of “system”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Is your objection here based on causality? Do you think I wrongly assert that &quot;the &lt;i&gt;existence &lt;/i&gt; of a wealthy elite...&quot; is the cause of the 99% being a net-drain? That&#039;t not my position. The &lt;i&gt;cause &lt;/i&gt; of the distribution of wealth is our economic institutions, which includes both property law and the tax/welfare system. I don&#039;t blame the wealthy elite for the law of the land, which is largely the result of democratic process.]]></description>

<p>Given that we live in a government that has the norms of progressive taxation, welfare spending, and democratic rule, its very hard to imagine that in <i>our society</i>, you could make the 1% own 37% and not end up with the 99% being a net-drain on the government budget. Like I said earlier, the &#8220;99% will be a drain&#8221; is not intended to be a universal economic rule, but in relation to the system we have today.</p>
<blockquote><p>You can’t simply assert that the existence of a wealthy elite makes everyone else a “net drain on the system”, for either the whole-economy or tax-and-spend definition of “system”</p></blockquote>
<p>Is your objection here based on causality? Do you think I wrongly assert that &#8220;the <i>existence </i> of a wealthy elite&#8230;&#8221; is the cause of the 99% being a net-drain? That&#8217;t not my position. The <i>cause </i> of the distribution of wealth is our economic institutions, which includes both property law and the tax/welfare system. I don&#8217;t blame the wealthy elite for the law of the land, which is largely the result of democratic process.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/03/open-thread-122-5/#comment-727834&quot;&gt;Guy in TN&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;We’re talking about different things. Paul’s question, I believe, was in regard to government revenues, which I reference as “the system” in my statement. For the purposes of whether you are a net-drain on the tax system or not, it doesn’t matter how much wealth you produce, but how much you pay in taxes minus what you receive in benefits.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That doesn&#039;t change the analysis, or the analogy.  If you have a flat tax and a roughly balanced(*) budget, which pretty much has to be the case for the egalitarian baseline, you just multiply all the numbers by 25% or 75% or whatever the tax rate is, and the people who weren&#039;t net drains on the total-economy system are still not net drains on the government tax-and-spend part of the system.

And that&#039;s still true even if 1% of the population are filthy rich and making sixty times as much money, paying sixty times as much taxes, and receiving sixty times as much government services as anyone else.  The only way you get the 99% being a &quot;drain on the system&quot; is if you are using the government to progressively tax the rich and use their money to provide services to the poor.

You can&#039;t simply assert that the existence of a wealthy elite makes everyone else a &quot;net drain on the system&quot;, for either the whole-economy or tax-and-spend definition of &quot;system&quot;; you need to add and defend the assertion that the net effect of the system&#039;s policies (e.g. government taxing and spending) is to make the rich poorer and the poor richer.  Is that in fact what you believe?
