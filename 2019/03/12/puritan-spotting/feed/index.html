I don&#039;t think the Honor is from sf at all—it&#039;s a virtue name.

But her brother&#039;s middle name is Miles and her sister&#039;s name is Iselle. So one each, sf and fantasy.]]></description>

In the Albion&#039;s Seed time-frame, most American Jews were Sephardic (there also just weren&#039;t very many of them (about 2000 in 1790). New York was an early hub, as well as other port cities (Philly, Charleston, Savannah) and some Caribbean colonies -- pretty much all were merchants working the triangle trade.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why not Quakers? They were also quirky New Englanders but they didn’t produce any historical horrors until Nixon. The real puritans were assholes. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eh, they don&#039;t even come from the same parts of England. Puritans were usually East Anglian/Essex/London people, the Quakers were more middle/north England.

The Puritans were an older sect, stretching back to the initial conversion of England to Protestantism (and immense frustrations over Henry VIII&#039;s eccentricities), while the Quakers were part of the religious enthusiasm and experimentalism of the Commonwealth era.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/12/puritan-spotting/#comment-730110&quot;&gt;Eponymous&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Have you actually talked to any of them? You might be surprised.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#039;ve worked with most of them.

I&#039;ll be honest: Where the hell do you all live where the tradespeople who are white aren&#039;t just native whites? Few of them are &#039;Borderer&#039; here in the Philly area, they&#039;re all just native Philadelphians. Some you can trace back through various immigrant groups over the last few centuries, some have been here forever (I worked in a package shipping shop with a guy who had lived in my hometown since he was born in the late 70&#039;s and whose family had lived there since the 18th century -- an ancestor of his shows up on local tax records from the early 1700&#039;s: Propertyless).

Doctor, I think you may have a bit of a persecution complex. The &#039;Blue Tribe&#039;, as it would be understood from Scott&#039;s initial post on the matter, isn&#039;t just &#039;rich, urban whites from coastal cities&#039;, it&#039;s a lot of different types of people.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In regard to where they&#039;ve gone.  I&#039;ve invented a syndrome called &quot;Scotlandization&quot;, based on the electoral map of one of Margaret Thatcher&#039;s victories.  It showed that the Conservatives won no ridings in Scotland.  I wondered how Thatcher could win.  But Scotland has only 10% of the population of the UK; how Scotland votes doesn&#039;t really affect things.  Hence, &quot;Scotlandization&quot;, when a region with a distinct political culture becomes so depopulated as to become politically irrelevant, despite its aspirations to tell everyone else what to do.

In particular, New England is Scotlandized within the United States.  As a regular reader of the &lt;i&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/i&gt;, I can tell you that the remnant Puritans believe in their hearts that they are the moral compass of the country.

I suspect the reason that New England has become Scotlandized is that it is a combination of a large rural area with poor farming with a single metro area that (for various specific political reasons) tightly controls the building of housing, and thus has a high cost of living.  The result is that people emigrate from New England, and to a great degree, they&#039;ve been immigrating to Texas (which has very loose zoning laws).  So the migrant Puritans are isolated in their new homeland and are reprogrammed into Borderers.

One could also consider Europe as becoming Scotlandized in the world as a whole.]]></description>
