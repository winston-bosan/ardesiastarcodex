Bacon and sausage must be cooked before eating, while jerky and meat sticks are ready to eat. They&#039;re used in completely different ways.]]></description>

As someone who has experienced drug-induced mania, I too immediately thought of this. I don&#039;t think your story is abnormal in the least - the desire to eat something as conveniently and quickly as possible (to disappear the hunger) follows the rest of the logic of that state.

I think a necessary adjacent study would be to compare rates of beef jerky consumption in bipolar mania patients with beef jerky consumption in methamphetamine users. Then cross-check other gas station and packaged meal foods.]]></description>

Per-capita income includes everyone, not just wage-earners.  So it&#039;s dragged down by students, children, and those weird old guys who wander around college campuses and you think might be professors but also might be bums.]]></description>

Meh, hard to tell from that link. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The per capita income for the borough was $45,566 (+/- $5,208). About 6.5% of the population were below the poverty line&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Median household income there is $100k, but I guess it depends on your definition of &quot;wildly different&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How could we tell that the causal arrow goes from beef jerky-&#062; mania rather than mania -&#062; beef jerky?  It seems likely that people who are manic have different cravings.  I know personally that mood is linked to wanting different foods?

Suppose mania leads to protein cravings and also to very short time preferences.  If someone wants protein and they want it right now, they are likely to to buy jerky or other cured meats.  Those who are hospitalized for mania must be exhibiting mania before they are hospitalized and eat jerky while manic, before their mania gets them hospitalized.]]></description>
