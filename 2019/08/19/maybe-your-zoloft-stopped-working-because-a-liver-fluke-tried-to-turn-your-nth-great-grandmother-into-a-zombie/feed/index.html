No coincidence that elephants also bury their dead and have &quot;funerals&quot; to mourn them (or contemplate the cause of death to better avoid it).  And animals with greater brain size and social cognition are are much more able to detect potentially ill members of their group and avoid them (or nurture them, if genetically related).]]></description>

Smartest comment on here. 

It&#039;s no coincidence iodine is extraordinary anti-septic and kills just about anything in even tiny doses, and very bizarre the body relies on a system subject to so much breakage and a very historically common nutrient deficiency as its master regulator of movement levels (i.e. most able to produce rapid movement or total lack of it similar to the animal parasitism examples).

It would be very difficult to get enough iodine to over-rev the system from food sources, and any high consumption of it would naturally be very rough on the parasite. 



As to dopamine: Scott fails to mention it&#039;s pretty tough to get access to the brain, or at least takes some time, and the sophisticated viruses and bacteria that do get in may by that point have a much more complex strategy than turn the person crazy.  There&#039;s a reason people have a real instinctual fear of psychotic or unstable people--evolutionarily speaking this is a defense against brain parasites affecting these systems.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Not that any of them object to humans as a snack, just that the direct predator-prey relationship necessary for a parasite to become dependent on it isn’t really there for most potential evolutionary-environment predators.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Well just because non of the predators alive today hunt humans  primarily, does not mean that non in the past did.
We know that the introduction of Homo Sapiens to an environment is strongly corelated with extinction events for mega fauna in that environment. Which is even true for Africa shortly after behavioral modern humans developed.
I would not be surprised if every predator that primarily hunted for the genus Homo had nasty case of getting extinct, in the last 300k years.]]></description>

IIrc there are some wolves in Ethiopia, but they tend to hunt alone rather than in packs, and aren&#039;t individually very large; otoh, there is direct evidence of predation on early humans by large cats (specifically, skulls with puncture marks that match up to leopard teeth). Lions (especially solitary males not hunting for a whole pride) certainly aren&#039;t averse to taking a human if they find one alone. Hyenas and wild dogs probably could take humans as well, but again the prey that they  actively *look for* is more on the order of horse-sized.  Not that any of them object to humans as a snack, just that the direct predator-prey relationship necessary for a parasite to become dependent on it isn&#039;t really there for most potential evolutionary-environment predators.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Coming from a biology background, my thought was to extend this logic further into evolutionary history. What if organisms evolved into larger sizes due to this parasitic pressure. It is easy to forget, but more than half of all species on the planet are parasites. Every productive autotroph and heterotroph has multiple specific and non specific parasites. So there is a strong reason to believe that parasitism is a major driving factor in evolution.

So overall the reason why we have any larger animals at all could be /partially be to support anti parasitic complex behavioural and immunogical pathways. It is expensive, slow reproducing, large animals which are more fragile vs smaller organisms. But there is an upward pressure on size due to the big advantages that come with complex pathways such that smaller organisms such as insects developed very different survival by massive numbers in each reproductive round type solutions.

Not to be silly and say evolution planned out complexity, more a survivorship of larger organisms when they became complex. 

As for Scott&#039;s objection about, &#039;why not this easily manipulated pathway&#039;... There are limits to biology and in a speculative hand waving non specific way I can at least argue that in evolution you can&#039;t get to some end points from some starting points. Seritonin is very old and bacteria have it for other purposes and can hack it to be useful. Perhaps some of our big organism signaling is newer or super toxic to small parasites, or some other resason we picked a few simpler pathways due to an incompatibility with parasites. Perhaps the other counter is that we have some simple pathways because we lacked a route to make them both complex and functional.]]></description>

Controllability correlates with scrutability because you need controllability to run an experiment.  If you get a different result every time you run the same test, you won&#039;t learn much.  That&#039;s true whether &quot;running the test&quot; means injecting a chemical into the cell, or inserting a gene into a parasite that secretes that chemical.]]></description>
