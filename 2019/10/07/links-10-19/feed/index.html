I mentioned the confidence interval issue on my post here as well (Oct 11th at 9 AM)

I think your second to last point was what motivated me to make my post in the first place though. The number of lives saved is somewhat small compared to the money spent. Heck, would people not be better off if we just game them a monthly cash grant the size of medicaid in those cases?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was interested in the study showing that giving people free health insurance does make them live longer.  

I am anything but an expert in statistics, but I was interested enough to struggle through the study, to get the gist, and here&#039;s what they came up with: 
They looked at people who were poor enough that they probably didn&#039;t have health insurance before ACA kicked in.  They focused on &#039;the poorest of the poor&#039;, those who would have been eligible for medicaid after ACA kicked in.  Many people living in states that adopted the ACA expanded medicaid option did sign up for medicaid, while those living in states that didn&#039;t adopt the medicaid option, of course, didn&#039;t.  So they had a natural experiment.  They had mortality data for &#039;all adults&#039; but they focused on the 55-65 age group.  This is a real drawback of the study.  They say they also analysed the data for &#039;all adults&#039; and provided that information in &#039;the supplement&#039;, but gave no links to the supplement.  I couldn&#039;t find the supplement, presumably it is hidden behind a paywall.    Presumably the supplement shows that people of all ages are less sick than people 55-65 and thus, benefit less from health care.  Seems dishonest to publicize the results for the sickest group and hide the data for &#039;all adults&#039;.  
Anyway, they came up with about half a million people total in this age and income group to look at.
The delta between the group that was in states that adopted ACA and states that didn&#039;t was very small, but real-- a 0.132 percentage point decline in annual mortality  (out of every 1000 people, 1 fewer died when provided with medicaid than without).  They looked at 4 years worth of data, and it was statistically significant in all 4 years, but not great levels of statistical significance— 5% in 3 of the years, and 1% in one of the years.   If you want to look at the actual results, with error bars, they are shown in figure 2 of the study.  The error bars on the results are pretty wide. They don&#039;t provide the actual +/- on the results, another drawback of the study, they just graphically show the error bars in figure 2.  If I had to guess I would guess that the error was, roughly,  0.132+/- 0.1.  Like I said, the error bars are pretty wide.
They say that the average mortality per year for the people in the age and income category they looked at was about 1.7 per cent per year, so the decrease due to getting health insurance was from 1.7 people per hundred dying per year to 1.568 people per hundred dying per year-- or, if you include the error bars, roughly going from 1.7 people per hundred dying per year to 1.568+/-0.1 (1.468 to 1.668 people per hundred dying per year).  
This seems like an almost trivial delta, and the +/- uncertainty range almost swamps that tiny delta, but,  all four year&#039;s results are statistically significant, and the tiny small decrease in average mortality is multiplied by about half a million people, which ends up with an estimated additional 4,800 fewer deaths occurred per year among this population due to Medicaid expansion.  Probably would have been a lot more honest of them to highlight the uncertainty level,  and include the plus/minus uncertainty levels on the number of fewer deaths.  Just based on my eyeball estimates of the error bar size from Figure 2  something like 4,800 +/- 3636 fewer deaths per year, which would have been a much more honest statement of their level of knowledge.][I got 3636 from (4,800)1/1.32=3636] 

One of the biggest problems with the study, for the larger question of &#039;does providing free health care affect mortality outcomes&#039; is the fact that people in the group they looked at have much higher mortality rates than average, being both older and poorer than average--&#039;adults aged 55-65&#039; obviously have higher mortality rates than &#039;all adults&#039; and  &quot;the annual mortality rate for individuals ages 55 to 64 in households earning less than 138 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) is 1.7 percent, more than 4 times higher than the 0.4 percent rate experienced by higher-income individuals of the same age&quot;.    So it is difficult to know how well the results translate for the general population.  Presumably it is even lower than the not very impressive reduction of 1 person per 1000 treated.  If someone could did up the info from the supplement, we would get at least a partial answer, at least it would tell us what the results were for &#039;all adults&#039; in that income bracket, instead of just 55-65 year old&#039;s in that income bracket.   Presumably the number is even less impressive, since they chose to bury it.  How much lower the number would go if they had been able to look at people in all income categories is hard to say.
Anyway, the very tiny level of results leave me wondering, still, what is going on with medical care in general.    I think we spend something like 20% of our annual GDP on health care.   If the only delta of all that spending is really only 1 fewer death per thousand per year, OR LESS, I really wonder if all of that money is really, functionally, being thrown away?  
However, another drawback of the study is that the number I am using in the denominator, the 1000, is people who got health insurance, not people who went in for treatment.  That number of lives saved is presumably higher when you look at the number who actually were sick and went in for treatment, but how much higher, I have no idea.]]></description>

@Ant
Uhm, I am paying ~25ct/kwH, after conscious decessions for a local, provider. I could easyly lower that if I wanted.
Also I&#039;m paying 19% VAT on that, while our french neighbours are paying 5.5% on energy.

So I would take that source with, an grain of salt.]]></description>
