You could be right. I might need to look back over those few episodes to see if the idea of keeping the Janet-babies going was only brought up post-swap. 

Many of the things I see in the episodes just don&#039;t seem related to ending the show. They do have 13 episodes so there are time for side-quests, but it does not feel tight.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;You can’t say: “I’ll sleep for a time,” but rather have to say something like: “I’ll sleep for some time.”

Yet you also have “once upon a time,” but this refers to a long period, that clearly isn’t an instant. So doesn’t it make more sense to have “once upon a period?”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&quot;I&#039;ll sleep for some time&quot; would be more weird that &quot;I&#039;ll sleep for a time&quot; I think. The latter sounds archaic/formal but the former is just odd. 

&quot;Once upon a time&quot; does not refer to a long period- in fact I think it does refer to an instant. Of course it is only used as the intro to fairy tales.]]></description>

They definitely haven&#039;t &lt;i&gt;given up&lt;/i&gt;, since they put in explainers in this episode like the bit about why Bad Janet can now impersonate Good Janet when she explicitly couldn&#039;t in a previous episode. (Which might come into play later...this ultra-sophisticated Bad Janet is effectively a new character, now).

There&#039;s a suggestion in a previous episode ( &lt;i&gt;Janet(s)&lt;/i&gt;, I&#039;m pretty sure) that Janet thinks marbleization might be reversible--she suggests the desperate plan that Michael marbleize her while the humans are in her void and then &quot;find a way&quot; to bring her back once it&#039;s safe.

Janet could leave the neighborhood without it shutting down as far back as Season 1; it remains unclear how exactly that works. The implication here though seems to be that Bad Janet really took over all of her responsibilities, spoofing the neighborhood grid (or whatever it&#039;s called) as well as disguising herself. That seems like it would need to be a plot point next episode if so--does Eleanor need to make a deal with her to keep the lights on? If not, we could assume that Good Janet got all the babies working pretty well autonomously before being marbleized and Bad Janet was lying when she claimed to be micromanaging them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good Place spoiler for episode 4.

I think the writers have given up on having any consistent plot. I could sort of forgive it with Mindy St Claire, before they realized they wanted to have everyone go to the Bad Place in later seasons. But now in Season 4 we have Janet being marbleized, which I seem to remember was permanent. And this also does not shut down the entire experiment, when Janet is needed to keep the whole Janet-babies occupied.

I will stick it out, because the writing within each show is funny enough to continue to the end. But it is time to end.]]></description>

@ John
&lt;blockquote&gt;that’s &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the extreme Red Tribe version of the draft.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I don&#039;t believe anyone said it was, which is rather my point.
&lt;blockquote&gt;coming from a generally Blue-ish space.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is nearly as important with the rhetorical as with the kinetic, to distinguish between sender and receiver. The heuristic that disregards both proposals that advance Blue goals and those that are pitched to be more palatable to Blues is coming very close to selecting against competence.

&lt;blockquote&gt;That said, Dan L, I think you chose a bad example, because:
&lt;blockquote&gt;the notion that “the United States should implement mandatory military service for all young men and women” is an extreme Blue Tribe position.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Is definitely a Left Wing position, enough so that I’m not sure it could be classified as an extreme one.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
You can &lt;i&gt;find&lt;/i&gt; it on the Left, sure. Slim minority among Democrats, noticeable majority among Republicans, significant plurality overall. I think it&#039;s a &lt;i&gt;very good&lt;/i&gt; example in how some folks will see their opponents liking a thing, and assume it is both representative of and limited to that opposition.]]></description>
