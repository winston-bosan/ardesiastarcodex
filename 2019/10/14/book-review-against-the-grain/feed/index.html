					<description><![CDATA[Gatherer-hunter to intensive agriculturalist isn&#039;t a dichotomy, but a spectrum. The gatherer-hunter might return to a known good spot, might spread some seeds around for a later return, might be semi-nomadic around such a managed plot, might be into extensive agriculture combined with gathering and hunting, might be mostly an agriculturalist but with some foraging, might be an intensive agriculturalist. 

Some of these steps might be nice, some might be risk-reducing, some might result from environmental pressure, and some might result from overpopulation and social effects. Asking &quot;how could anyone want to go from being a hunter-gatherer to an intensive agriculturalist when the latter is crap?!&quot; is a bit like when creationists claim that a fully developed eye couldn&#039;t just pop into existence. Which is true - there has to be a progressive pathway, and then it suddenly seems inevitable instead.]]></description>

This is important. A lot - a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; - of the &quot;barbarian&quot; states were also agricultural societies. How do you think the Franks or Goths made their living?]]></description>

I would also imagine that the beer avoids another downside of grains - when you mill grain in crummy mills, you get some stone residue in it, which is murder on your teeth. In a beer, this would supposedly sink to the bottom.]]></description>

It works (for a value of &quot;works&quot;).

&quot;In fact, Nordic grog was a complex brew, McGovern and his colleagues found. The ingredients included honey, cranberries and lingonberries (acidic red berries that grow in Scandinavia). Wheat, rye and barley — and, occasionally, imported grape wine from southern Europe — formed a base for the drink. Herbs and spices — such as bog myrtle, yarrow, juniper and birch resin — added flavor and perhaps medicinal qualities.&quot;

I think it&#039;s solid - it&#039;s all about reserves and risks. No matter how well fed you are in general, you will die in a really bad year. In the agricultural society, there is some amount of trade and emptying of granaries to cushion this.

&quot;It&#039;s great until it isn&#039;t&quot; seems to be the description of hunter-gatherer life.

Further, nutrition is about a lot more than calories - the gatherer-hunter is likely have a mixed diet with reasonable amounts of protein and all the other non-calorie nutrition one wants, while the agriculturalist will subsist mostly on calories that have little else going for them. This explains why agriculturalists were shorter.]]></description>

Re: population density

The standard explanation here is that while you can normally get away with little work in a gatherer-hunter society (I invert the name to put the most important bit first), you also don&#039;t have any food reserves, so when something goes badly wrong, people die in droves.

I have the same criticism as you do - if &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; was great, then we would have had a Malthusian population expansion until things were no longer all great.]]></description>

The part about continuous population decline vis runaways made me raise my eyebrows. If this happens in every state, how can they keep raiding each other to steal slaves? Where do the masses run to? Why would I take in some starved runaway if I&#039;m a barbarian living in the marginal land they&#039;re running away to? How do we sustain such a continuous flow from much more densely populated land if we&#039;re too marginal to support a state of our own? Why wouldn&#039;t a king realize he can get a bunch of immigrants if he just treats his people better, reducing tax rate but increasing revenue? Wouldn&#039;t the first state to attract instead of scare off farmers have a comparative advantage in both revenue and manpower?]]></description>
