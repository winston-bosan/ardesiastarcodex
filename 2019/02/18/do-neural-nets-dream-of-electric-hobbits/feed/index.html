I would like to make the argument that the smallest unit of meaning is the sentence (used somewhat loosely): that at least is the level where the combination of morphemes functions at the level of meaning. Morphemes have significance, but the significance is multivalent and under-determined out of the context of a sentence. It&#039;s at the level of the sentence that the meaning we&#039;re familiar with arises, at least in normal human speech acts.

This is at least a contributor to my skepticism that a system like GPT-2 might function in a way at all analogous to human communication.]]></description>

Hi -- I was wondering if you could direct me to any sources on the concept of exotic binding of LSD and ketamine? I&#039;m quite interested in the effect of these two drugs on feelings of wakefulness/dreaming.]]></description>

Saruman also boasted to Gandalf of being &quot;Saruman the Wise, Saruman Ring-maker, Saruman of Many Colours&quot;.

I have my doubts about whether the author of &#039;Leaf by Niggle&#039; really hated allegory as much as he claimed to in that Foreword.]]></description>

That&#039;s surprising. The whole point of the NP versus P distinction is that there are things which are easy to recognize but hard to produce. Is &quot;sensible English prose&quot; not such a thing? (Of course, there is isn&#039;t a hard line between sensible and not, but I think the analogy is reasonable.) For that matter, why did spam filters so thoroughly win the war on spam if it is so easy to engineer something to pass a filter?]]></description>
