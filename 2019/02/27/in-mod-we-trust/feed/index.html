					<description><![CDATA[They&#039;re hiring people with no skills at the bottom of the SES ladder ($28.8k/year is a pretty paltry wage). These people are probably mostly not very well-educated and are probably on the bottom of the general intellectual/psychological spectrum.

I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if some people cracked under that stress, and let&#039;s face it, a lot of this stuff is directed towards the bottom of society to begin with.

I would wager they&#039;d probably encounter far fewer problems if they had people undergo a psychological battery of tests and hired college graduates, but moderation &quot;seems&quot; like a low-end job.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Aren’t there rhetorically-skilled people on every side of any issue though? &lt;/blockquote&gt; No. (And not all issues have just 2 sides.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/27/in-mod-we-trust/#comment-726957&quot;&gt;Reasoner&lt;/a&gt;.

My point is that this method won&#039;t detect &quot;that stuff&quot;, or any category of &quot;stuff&quot;.

For example: people leave the news feed after viewing all kinds of content, simply because they have to stop somewhere. Since the news feed is already ranked by how much FB thinks you want to see each story, most of the time, your stopping point is just a function of how much time you&#039;re willing to spend scrolling through the feed and how well the stories above that point held your interest.

When people take action to hide the content itself, I believe that&#039;s already tracked and used in the model. Page admins can see how many followers hid a post or unfollowed/unliked the page in response to it. But other than feeding that back into the ranking model, it&#039;s hard to justify any more serious action, because most of that content will just be stuff people found uninteresting or disagreed with.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is very little wrong with Facebook that wouldn&#039;t be solved by moving to a subscription model. Facebook doesn&#039;t fix itself because bilking advertisers with fake impressions from fake profiles is stupidly profitable. It&#039;s not sustainable but Facebook is not run by strategic thinkers.]]></description>

Right - strong negative effects. And zero evidence that self-enforced &#039;quality&#039; has any bearing on those effects. But if you want to make the argument that social media is a social good - which I would oppose - then you don&#039;t have to worry: the people most responsible for it (the engineers and product managers) are very well compensated.

Common decency - or &#039;being good&#039;, or pious, or a good comrade, or other ill-defined subjective notions - has nothing to do with the functioning of labor markets. Such considerations bring nothing constructive to the discussion.]]></description>

The working conditions and the salary are two different issues. The working conditions (at least the &quot;no paper etc.&quot; parts) are for ass-covering, rather than money-saving.

As for the salaries, if unions or anything else forced companies to pay higher than market-clearing salaries for a particular kind of work, then some people who would like to get this kind of work even at the current wages (in the sense that they would be better off than in any other option available to them) couldn&#039;t get the job.

You talk as though there was something especially evil about Facebook preferring money to flow to them, rather than anyone else. Who doesn&#039;t?]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;There’s a train of thought that thinks of wage laborers in certain positions as “wage slaves” who have no choice but to work some kind of soul crushing position (I’m not a proponent of such a line of thought, but I can understand the reasoning). Even with that it’s not quite the same as the Omelas story, but as far as metaphors go, it seems pretty close. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
There is a large difference between &quot;in order for your society to work, someone must have a horrible life&quot; and &quot;in order for your society to work, someone who has a horrible life, and will any way, has to be part of it.&quot; 

The view you describe makes FB the second case--if it didn&#039;t hire those people, they would have at least as bad a job somewhere else, which is why they agree to work for FB.]]></description>
