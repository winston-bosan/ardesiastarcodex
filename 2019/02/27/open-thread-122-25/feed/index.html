More or less I agree. A big problem in education discussions is people thinking they can take apples and make lemonade. Its a major policy failing because we have this system that&#039;s job is just to kind of shuffle kids through and reveal how smart they are, not a system that imparts great value. Yet everyone thinks they can use this system to fix all the social problems they perceive.]]></description>

In &quot;home-schooling&quot; our 14 year-old son there&#039;s a bit more in out-of-pocket expenses, mostly in computer repairs and replacement, but also in transportation as we outsource some classes to a local community college that&#039;s further away than the middle school. 

I&#039;d be inclined to have him just go to the nearby Catholic school which is close to our house, but my wife vetoes that idea.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Also, homeschooling isn’t cheap once you consider the opportunity cost of a family member (typically a parent) having to forego a paying job to stay at home to teach.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Consider this hypothetical:

Second income of $40,000.
Daycare costs of $40/day X 250 working days = $10,000
Taxes on income = $10,000
Additional clothing/gas/vehicle/etc. = $5,000
Strain of second working adult = Variable, mostly non-monetary.

For most working families, a second job isn&#039;t nearly as lucrative as it might seem.  Add in the emotional and mental strain of having no one at home, and then paying someone else to raise your kids, and it&#039;s not hard to see how it might be a wash at best.  If you had to pay a housekeeper, an accountant, and a personal shopper, you would be behind from working.  With a second full time job, now somebody tired from a long day of work has to do those things.  

Same thing with the fact that you already pay taxes for the schooling you aren&#039;t getting.  It&#039;s a cost either way, so it can be discounted against either choice.]]></description>

&lt;i&gt;It depends on what you mean by implement, and what you mean by better methods of education.

Homeschooling make it clear that you can get solid educational outcomes with limited outlays.&lt;/i&gt;
I wasn&#039;t thinking of homeschooling. 

Also, homeschooling isn&#039;t cheap once you consider the opportunity cost of a family member (typically a parent) having to forego a paying job to stay at home to teach. A family that chooses to homeschool their children also doesn&#039;t get refunded the portion of their taxes that support the local public school they could otherwise be sending their children to, which should also be considered. 

Homeschooling also only provides a good education if the family member in charge is a good teacher, and most adult&#039;s aren&#039;t. It&#039;s a solution that therefore only works for a small minority of families.]]></description>

@The Nybbler

An issue is that helmet-wearers are known to be considerably more risk averse in the first place, probably due to selection effects (a risk averse person is more willing to bear the cost of wearing a helmet). Your meta-study notes a result which is consistent with this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Other studies show that crashes with helmeted cyclists on average are less serious than crashes with unhelmeted cyclists, even when cyclists with head injury are excluded from the comparison (Spaite et al., 1991), and that helmeted cyclists on average show less high-risk behaviour than unhelmeted cyclists&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They argue that they reduce this issue by making a comparison between injury types, rather than looking at absolute numbers, but that assumes that more severe crashes result in similar types of injuries than less serious crashes, which seems unlikely to me.

In the conclusion, the study explicitly notes that no hard conclusions can be drawn about selection effects:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The results from the present study do not allow conclusions about possible effects of bicycle helmet use on behaviour adaptation or selection effects.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

---

Anyway, the issue remains that all these studies are inconsistent with whole population data. Helmet laws didn&#039;t seem to have reduced the head injuries in Australia, New Zealand and parts of Canada. A more than doubling of helmet use in the US coincided with a 10% increase in head injuries.

Of course it is possible that there were other changes that offset these huge benefits that your study claims, but I suspect that those benefits are largely false. My guess is that any effects are more likely to be in the single-digit range than multi-digit.]]></description>

@DavidFriedman

I remember 2 arguments in the book.

One was about assortive mating + upward mobility leading to a brain drain among those in lower class occupations. 

The other was about race, heredity, race, and IQ. And race again. 

The first part seemed interesting. The second part seemed to be a very American kind of axe grinding. 

If he&#039;d stopped with the first part, I&#039;d have liked the book, and it probably wouldn&#039;t be a byword of villainy among some portion of those who&#039;ve heard of it - &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; of whom may even have read it.]]></description>
