					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/17/open-thread-121-5/#comment-722136&quot;&gt;Tenacious D&lt;/a&gt;.

From where we&#039;re standing bribery erodes the rule of law, but I&#039;m under the impression that historically it&#039;s sometimes done the opposite (immediate disclaimer: I&#039;m fuzzy on details and not an expert of any kind). I&#039;m thinking of the feudal-to-modern transitions in Europe, particularly in England. As I&#039;m given to understand it in broad terms, the ur-feudal condition is a hierarchy of landlords, and it gives way to a central state as the monarchs realize it&#039;s less risky to have some smart-but-disposable commoner running things for them than a powerful vassal who might rebel. But, since the new guys aren&#039;t landed aristocrats, they don&#039;t have an independent source of revenue. There&#039;s no real financial infrastructure, so you can&#039;t just send out paychecks -- the solution is to have everything be revenue-positive in the first place, and letting them take a cut, such that a job as tax-collector/judge/magistrate is the official license to collect bribes. The hypostasis, where everyone gets used to there being a state, comes later; bribery precedes the environment where you can even articulate a debate on whether to crack down on bribery.]]></description>

I&#039;m not baconbits, and I realize this thread is super dead now, but a)this heavily selected for sedentary people.  People who do not see gains from exercise are probably more likely to be sedentary, so people who do not see gains from exercise will be over represented in a selection of sedentary people.

The other issue is small sample size.  The error bars on applying results of 3 people out of thirty to the general population have to be pretty large.

I also have another issue with the study, but it isn&#039;t clear if it is an issue with the research or just the article&#039;s presentation of it.  They appear to be going purely off of the increase in oxygen consumption, but ignores the base rate of consumption (before starting the program).  Do the 3 people who saw no increase have a higher base rate than some of the others, meaning they did not need to increase oxygen consumption to perform the training (or, alternatively, do their bodies use oxygen more efficiently having the same result)?  Just going off of increase in O2 consumption and body fat % doesn&#039;t seem like enough to me.  More fitness markers need to be tested, and I&#039;m not even convinced they analyzed one of the two they used (O2 consumption) correctly.]]></description>

Huh what?  Why would they need some sort of centuries old documents to make them &quot;archdukes&quot;?  They already have the noble heritige, and everyone knows that already, they don&#039;t need more documents to prove that.  The main reason why they can&#039;t rule Europe is simply that the peace treaties after World War I explicitly forbid that.]]></description>

I hadn&#039;t heard about this, but coincidentally I did get an email today saying that a project had been cancelled that I had contributed to on PledgeMusic, which seems to be having a similar meltdown. Now we may never get to hear the full expanded remake of Mike Batt&#039;s The Hunting Of The Snark.]]></description>

That kind of thing obviously can happen, but it would seem so difficult to cover up for such a large company, and so likely to lead to actual jail time, that I just can&#039;t imagine this is it.

Naturally, there will be a major announcement in about ten minutes that the Etsy payment errors were the result of a ponzi-style setup where they [tried] to make it look like an accident.]]></description>
