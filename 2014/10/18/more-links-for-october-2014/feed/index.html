Kinda agree, but I tend to use the term &#039;phyg&#039; when I am criticising LW, because it&#039;s a way to get people to think of me as part of their in-group.]]></description>

Looking at this, LW scores very low on all of these measures of cultishness except perhaps wisdom/knowledge claimed and wisdom/knowledge credited which are medium at highest. Plausibly a couple of points for dogma as well since they don&#039;t like relativism, but I think that is it.]]></description>

I&#039;d like to express that I got the rhetorical point of this proposal and didn&#039;t get hung up on its extremism. Frequently, extreme policies that would be terrible ideas to enact can clarify a certain effect that might be achieved through more moderate means, and it kind of annoys me when they mindkill people.
(Though on communication consequentialist grounds you probably should try to avoid them)]]></description>

If there&#039;s a risk that your question will be perceived as weird or awkward, then it&#039;s still hurting you to ask. 

And &quot;a person&quot; didn&#039;t get *continued* affirmative consent..]]></description>

ADifferentAnonymous- It&#039;s not hard to come up with a similar scenario involving penetration.  Just use a rape case where the alleged victim consented to getting into bed naked with the alleged perpetrator and engaging in oral sex and manual genital stimulation.  The alleged perpetrator believes he is engaging in foreplay, so he moves naturally from foreplay to penetration when the moment seems right.  She reacts negatively.  

Unless her negative reaction is clear enough, there&#039;s a good chance penetration will have occurred before her reaction can be noticed, interpreted, and her partner can respond.  If her reaction is &quot;silence&quot; or &quot;lack of resistance,&quot; both of which affirmative consent rules focus on, they will be particularly hard to notice and we should expect lag time.  Under an affirmative consent rubric, we might say that the guy reasonably believed that he had affirmative consent from her positive response to his foreplay.  But his belief was incorrect.  So he failed his duty to ensure he actually had ongoing affirmative consent, and engaged in at least a few moments of penetration before noticing his partner&#039;s silent &quot;lack of yes&quot; and stopped.

Or just imagine a scenario where a woman consents to sexual penetration, then changes her mind while penetration is ongoing.  Per affirmative consent rules her partner has an ongoing affirmative duty to have affirmative consent at all times, and &quot;silence&quot; and &quot;lack of resistance&quot; are not consent.  Lets assume that she does not verbally communicate (that is, is silent), and does not clearly non verbally communicate (resist).  At best, she has a negative expression on her face (though the scenario doesn&#039;t even require that).  There will presumably be lag time between the changing of her mind and the point where her partner figures it out.

Veronica d will no doubt continue to spin scenarios of two people reaching tremulously, haltingly towards each other, maintaining eye contact, and sharing an unspoken bond that makes each completely and reliably aware of exactly what the other welcomes.  But some of us have sex without vulcan mind melds- awkwardly, clumsily, doing our best, communicating, MIS-communicating, and apologizing when we get it wrong.

You&#039;d think that someone in the kink community would be more concerned about a rule that effectively prohibits reliance on safeword systems, but whatevs.]]></description>

You can do &#038;&#035;x1f36a; &#x1f36a;

or &#038;127850; &#127850;

Usually it accepts unicode, but apparently not the cookie.]]></description>
