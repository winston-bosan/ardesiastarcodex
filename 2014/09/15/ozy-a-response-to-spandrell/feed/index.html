I got a very good hypothesis from my computational complexity professor: It could be like Sickle-cell disease. One recessive gene gives you evolutionary advantage in the environment with malaria. It could be just like that with a complex of genes responsible for propensity to homosexuality. Part of those genes might give you some kind of advantage (artistic creativity and whatnot).]]></description>

This is presumably because men who think catcalling is acceptable behavior won’t do in the presence of a man that might not think catcalling is acceptable behavior.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;That isn’t a solution, it just passes the buck one step further. Why does such a massive and common problem with prenatal development persist? Why hasn’t natural selection solved it?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Why hasn&#039;t natural selection solved all developmentally-related conditions, like autism? I don&#039;t know, but maybe prenatal development is hard to optimize. Maybe homosexuality is only an issue in the presence of certain genes. Prenatal development adds another layer of developmental noise.]]></description>

The Wikipedia article was only intended to show that a prenatal hypothesis for homosexuality is popular. It was not intended to summarize all the research on the subject. For those who are interested, see this &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/news/features/33520/index1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;popular article&lt;/a&gt; and this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3138231/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;journal review&lt;/a&gt; for a start.

So here are the physical or prenatal factors that relate to homosexuality:
- Birth order
- Digit ratio
- Handedness
- Oto-acoustic emissions (inner ear physiology)
- CAH women
- &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness_and_sexual_orientation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Left-handedness&lt;/a&gt;
- Maternal stress (weaker evidence)
- DES exposure (weaker evidence)

While some of these studies are stronger than others, this is an impressive collection of evidence.]]></description>

I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s exactly responsive to this specific subthread, but I have a metaphor I&#039;d like to try out to illustrate something:

Bob smokes three packs a day for years.  Eventually, he develops sufficient lung damage that a lung transplant is the only way  he will live beyond the year.

Alice and Bob are talking.  Alice asks how Bob is doing, and Bob says, &quot;I need a new lung.&quot;  Alice says, &quot;I&#039;m not sure you deserve a new lung.  You&#039;ve been heavily smoking for years.  Probably there are other people deserve that lung transplant more.&quot;

The thing is, they can both be right.  Bob is correct when he says, &quot;I need a new lung.&quot;    Alice is correct (for some moral systems, anyway) when she says, &quot;You don&#039;t deserve a new lung.&quot;  The problem arises when Alice (and Cathy, and Dianna, and Evelyn, and Frank the Ally) assume that &quot;I need a new lung&quot; is connotationally equivalent to &quot;I deserve a new lung.&quot;  Bob might mean it that way.  But he might not!

(Where this metaphor breaks down, though, is that Henry from the other post &lt;i&gt;IS&lt;/i&gt; like Bob, except that a bunch of women are lining up to give him lungs.  Whereas Ben, who was born with a congenital pulmonary flaw, gets chased with pitchforks and torches whenever he mentions he needs a lung.)

[I suggest that responses to this be forked elsewhere, to restore column length.]]]></description>
