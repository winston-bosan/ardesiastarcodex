					<description><![CDATA[For a long time I vaguely believed that concern about caffeine (e.g. not drinking normal tea before bed) was mostly food purity similar to organic/non-GMO/fat-free/etc, because I&#039;ve consumed large amounts of caffeine both regularly and irregularly and have never felt neither any effect nor any withdrawals. This was dispelled when in college I saw people have so much caffeine their hands started shaking, but to this day it&#039;s never worked for me.]]></description>

I have this exact phenomenon. I think I first experienced it when I would visualize the setting of fiction I was reading as some sort of version of a place I was familiar with, &quot;adapted&quot; to the description in the book.  I wouldn&#039;t realize this until later reflection.

But I have realized over the past several years that when I think intensely about /anything/ even if it is just purely conceptual, I will visualize some place just as you describe. The thing is that it is not at all distracting or noticeable when it happens, it&#039;s not till i pull out of it that I realize I was vividly imagining some completely unrelated location.  It honestly seems helpful, as I associate the memory with the location, and it helps me &quot;get into&quot; the thought.  I have noticed that when my brain uses a location this way, it will often use it  several times successively. But I haven&#039;t ever noticed a particular concept changing the location it is associated with.  Because it&#039;s all subconscious, it&#039;s hard to keep track of.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/17/what-universal-human-experiences-are-you-missing-without-realizing-it/#comment-45602&quot;&gt;Alicorn&lt;/a&gt;.

Tickling is spectacularly painful to me.  I have been assaulted unduly many times in my life and tickled... I&#039;m not sure of relative frequency rates.  Too much, but I have a distinctive bias about what constitutes too much.  Were I choosing on basis of pain levels, I would swap a very few of the most painful assaults into ticklings, but only a very few.  The cases where I would rather be tickled are exceptions.  I have a sincere general preference for being punched rather than tickled.

When I&#039;m tickled, I laugh uncontrollably, cannot breathe, and cannot express pain by any verbal or nonverbal means save crying, which is interpreted to be from laughter.  When the tickling lets up, standard expressions kick back in, and I will wail and groan with it.  If I did not start crying while being tickled, I will surely start crying then.  If I am only &quot;slightly&quot; tickled, people notice that my laughter is accompanied by exaggerated pain responses in between every forced-laughter-tickle-response.  They also notice that I beg them in horror to stop and never do it again.  More sustained tickling is the torture that gives me no mouth with which to scream.

When I was little, my family tickled me often, and responded to my post-tickling crying by tickling me more.  This got seared into my memory from an age when memories do not usually form that permanently.  Precisely no member of my family stopped when I developed the verbal skill to beg them to stop.  Some of them did at least stop when I became articulate enough to specify that I wanted them to stop because it hurt a whole awful lot.  The rest of them continued for several years in spite of my post-tickling protestations until I began punching, kicking, pulling hair, clawing skin, and generally doing whatever I could to break through the forced laughter and share the horrific pain I was in so that they would believe me when I asked them to stop because it hurt.  To this day, my response to people who do not give time or attention to the &quot;slight&quot; cues and go straight for sustained tickling is a berserker fury that does not care who is on the other end of it or, sadly, whether or not I have warned them not to tickle me.  I cannot leave that state until they stop tickling me, and I don&#039;t know how much time after because berserking ruins memory, but generally enough to hit them several more times with everything I&#039;ve got.  It hurts so much.]]></description>

I went to a Ron Paul rally that almost worked.  Seemed to be built out of pure fake-it-till-you-make-it.  Never had another celeb that I cared to fake it that hard about, so my other experiences are all, uh... strictly worse than yours.  Being around people who are LOUDLY EXCITED tends to make me randomly cry with probability dependent on extremity of noise.  People just being loud doesn&#039;t do this, people just being excited doesn&#039;t do this, but people being LOUDLY EXCITED is hell.  I can watch a video of such an event with equanimity; I tune out the crowds.  Actually being in such an event makes me feel like I&#039;m packed in like a sardine in a barrel of monkeys.  The uncanny valley of *nobody around me seems like an actual person anymore* is ridiculously aversive.

I think it&#039;s introvert-extrovert linked.  My need to talk to people is negligible.  My tendency to randomly adopt opinions from others, even temporarily, is supremely disturbing to me when it happens.  I gather it occurs at a lower rate for me than it does for most people.  Mobs can&#039;t co-opt me unless I&#039;m very well convinced that I already agree in every particular, and even then I tend to drift out of alignment with them at random.  I&#039;m almost never part of a crowd and I almost never want to be.]]></description>

&#062; I think that’s more a function of politics being (ideally) about ideas, and flag-waving groupthink jingoism being destructive to the exchange and evaluation of ideas.

Politics being ideally about ideas is somewhat of a semantics change. Politics are not ideal, they are political. Everything is ideally about ideas.]]></description>

What are the real differences between &quot;threats to reputation&quot; and &quot;being offended&quot;? This is a serious question. In my experience, most things that offend people are things where that person has involved their ego in in it extensively and an outsider is appearing to assign it lower status than said person feels it deserves. This could be construed as a &quot;threat to reputation&quot;]]></description>

Another important distinction (imo) is how people react to being offended may differ as well. Being accused of cheating is a direct blow to the ego, some may respond by becoming angry/offended/whatever, while others may be dismissive and lower their trust/mental status of the offender, which would not outwardly appear as &quot;being offended&quot;]]></description>

Yeah, warm colours give me the thought of warmth, when cool colours give me the thought of cool. I think that&#039;s fairly normal.

I don&#039;t have synethesia with most anything else, though I do have memories as a kid of associating letters/numbers with colours fairly heavily. Now the only thing really like that is if I force myself to pick a colour for letters, a few of them will have associated colours. A-red B-light blue S-yellow T-forrest green. But I have to force myself to think about it in order to experience anything.]]></description>
