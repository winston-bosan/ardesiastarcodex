You&#039;d think, but my SiL who is bright and educated and normally rational claims that she&#039;s a vegan because of the torture to animals in the barbaric conditions of modern factory farming, but she won&#039;t eat the beef and pork that me and my siblings raise on our little hobby farms, where she can and does go outside and see the animals being care for.

&#062; how is this different from just playing devil’s advocate with oneself?

The difference is that in addition to good arguments, you&#039;re supposed to subject yourself to the withering scorn and incomprehending stares of a society where everyone knows that you&#039;re completely and straightforwardly wrong, and is hard-pressed to see you as anything but a willfully evil monster. After spending some time in such a world, aren&#039;t you at least going to wonder whether you&#039;re just rationalizing when you talk about how the cows we eat wouldn&#039;t exist otherwise, in the same way the antebellum slaveholder rationalizes that his slaves wouldn&#039;t know what to do with themselves if they weren&#039;t slaves?]]></description>

I shouldn&#039;t have said &quot;there is virtually no natural selection&quot;, because natural selection never stops. 

I was correct to say &quot;IQ is now negatively correlated with fertility, and the most intelligent aren’t even at replacement fertility.&quot;

That is, natural selection hasn&#039;t stopped, but has reversed what it is selecting for. Natural selection is having a dysgenic effect rather than a eugenic effect. Bruce Charlton describes it as &quot;The modern world is selecting for pure fertility&quot;, i.e. just fertility, not intelligence or good qualities. Intelligence is being sacrificed for fertility.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/05/dont-be-an-asch-hole/#comment-96678&quot;&gt;Said Achmiz&lt;/a&gt;.

Why should it follow from dogs being friendly that eating their meat is wrong? I have eaten dog; it&#039;s not the tastiest meat available, but it&#039;s not bad. I have also kept a dog as a pet, which I would not have eaten unless absent any other form of available nutrition. The same goes for cat and rabbit.

Would it be wrong to grow and kill human babies for organ harvesting? Well... no. Assuming a suitable situation where in vitro development can follow in vitro fertilisation, and hence the process isn&#039;t generating a vast cohort of weeping mothers giving up their newborn children, there is no real distinction between a child of one month and any other animal. They barely even demonstrate sentience. 

We kill animals (including many, many pigs, who appear to be really rather intelligent) for meat, organs, glue, leather, and a multitude of other resources, and I don&#039;t see that there is a Schelling fence between a one month old human and any other animal with equivalent self-knowledge and sensitivity. We don&#039;t eat people because the people to be eaten quite reasonably object; if it were to be possible in a similar situation as above to grow human beings in a confirmed vegetative state from birth, they would be a (inefficient and rather energy-intensive, so probably not worth the bother) valid source of meat.

I realise while writing this that F. and I are actually saying almost exactly the same thing; the lives of people and animals have very similar moral importance. The difference is that you&#039;re assigning this importance a value somewhere greater than that of tastiness or convenience, and I&#039;m assigning it one which is somewhat less than either. Other factors (sentiment, specific informed objection on the part of the creature to be eaten, legal issues and so on) generate a scale whereby some creatures are valued higher and treated better than others, but ceteris paribus (i.e. assume they&#039;re all brain-dead) the value of the fact of their being alive doesn&#039;t differ across species as far as I&#039;m concerned.

TL;DR: If you eat pork but wouldn&#039;t eat (not-someone&#039;s-pet) dog or (parentless-vegetative-state-stranger) human, I am confused by your ethics. If you refuse to eat meat but use insecticide, rat poison, glue, leather etc, or support the elimination of malaria by use of DDT, I am similarly confused. If you don&#039;t eat meat because you think it tastes nasty, I completely understand - I won&#039;t try to feed you things containing myoglobin if you don&#039;t try to feed me things containing chlorophyll, deal?]]></description>

Do you think the Holocaust and meat-eating situations are moral-philosophically analogous?

(No, I&#039;m not trying to Godwin this; I&#039;m not asking if you think meat eating as &lt;i&gt;as bad&lt;/i&gt; as the Holocaust or any such thing. I just want to know if you think the nature and structure of our disagreement is analogous to one we might have with an unrepentant sociopathic Nazi.)

By the way, I didn&#039;t say/ask anything about morality being &quot;subjective&quot; or &quot;objective&quot; or whatever; I think that&#039;s a red herring. I only asked if you were ok with me eating meat. I guess the answer is no? If so, are you at all uncomfortable with the fact that a fellow human being, who is not (to my knowledge) a sociopath, just cannot be convinced to behave in a way you consider moral?

Also, would you try and stop me from gassing all the Jews or what have you? If not, why not? If yes, why wouldn&#039;t you stop me from eating meat? (This goes back to &quot;is this analogous to a disagreement re:holocaust.)]]></description>

&quot;I won’t try and stop you&quot;

If you mean physically, I would never try to stop a person from eating meat, but it doesn&#039;t follow from morality being subjective. My subjective morality might authorize me to try and stop you.

I&#039;m no moral philosopher and have no strong opinions on moral philosophy, but it seems to me that there are no universally persuasive arguments for slavery being bad, the holocaust being bad... there&#039;s always a slave-owner or nazi who says &quot;no I disagree with your premises&quot;. But there are anti-slavery and anti-holocaust arguments that rely on very common intuition, and just like that there are arguments against meat that rely on very common intuitions.]]></description>

&lt;i&gt;I’m thinking of the animal welfare activists who oppose hunting and still eat meat.&lt;/i&gt;

Ok, fair enough.

&lt;i&gt;I guess this means that there are no objective moral values, but I’m not a philosopher.&lt;/i&gt;

I suppose my followup question would be: are you ok, then, with the injunctions and rules that result from your moral intuitions, to be non-binding upon those who don&#039;t share those intuitions?

In other words: are you ok with saying: &quot;I don&#039;t eat meat, and if you, like me, think animals have value, then you also shouldn&#039;t eat meat; but if you&#039;re the sort of person who doesn&#039;t share any of those moral intuitions, then it&#039;s fine for you to eat meat, and I won&#039;t try and stop you&quot;?]]></description>
