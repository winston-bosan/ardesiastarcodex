I thought there were European languages for which only one text existed, but a fast search hasn&#039;t turned up any examples.

Supposing that there is such a language with only one or a few texts, it&#039;s embedded in a cultural context-- it&#039;s related to other languages, and it&#039;s about human beings on our familiar planet. The texts have been studied.

My assumption is that those texts wouldn&#039;t be a great starting point for a hard-to-decipher language.]]></description>

Let&#039;s try a slightly different question. 

How cryptographically secure is a foreign, unknown language? For example, suppose you landed on an alien planet and found a library of (text-only) books written in Klingon - and you don&#039;t know any Klingon, you&#039;ve never met a Klingon, you&#039;ve never even heard of a Klingon, and, of course, you don&#039;t have any Klingons around to interact with. All you&#039;ve got is all the Klingon text you could ever want. Could you decipher any of it?

Alternatively, could modern codebreaking techniques have deciphered the messages sent by the Navajo code talkers of World War II without using any prior knowledge of the Navajo language?]]></description>

This is the sort of tripe I&#039;m talking about. Not even trying to be funny, but instead repeating the same cliche phrases to the point where it&#039;s beyond dull. You remind me of those who spam sex chats with &quot;Who wants to talk about my sex wife&quot; or &quot;Does anyone want to discuss brutal thai prisons&quot;. No finesse. No creativity. Only a mechanical churn of crap.]]></description>

I recall reading of statistical tests applied to dolphin calls, which had been unable to distinguish them from language (but *did* distinguish monkey calls). So if I were constructing such a thing I might just get some dolphin recordings and make up a transcription alphabet.]]></description>

Scott accepts the libertarian argument for strictly non-negative utility of advertising purchases?

I hope you reconsider, not because I&#039;m bothered by you having that belief, but because if you reconsider you&#039;ll probably do it with data and stuff and write an awesome post about it.]]></description>
