Its an old article but I want to point out books bound in human flesh would not bother me at all. I am not sure I would outright purchase one but I would vaguely consider it. Assuming I was sure this would not lead in any way toward people getting killed. 

Though I think I have an extremely unusually low level of digust toward most things (except bugs).]]></description>

Or you could instead precommit to flipping a coin to choose between the two, at the time that the sensors tell you that missiles have launched. That might still be an effective deterrent, if the aggressors judge that the positive utility from the hypothetical attack is less than half the negative utility of the hypothetical counterattack. And it would give a 50% chance of saving the world if a sensor mistake happens.]]></description>

Thirded.

I agree with your interpretation of Kant.  However, complications quickly arise over who gets to define the action.  Is lying, for example, necessarily about deception?  Maybe the liar claims that he just likes saying the opposite of the truth sometimes, and he doesn&#039;t care what the listener believes.  If we &lt;i&gt;define&lt;/i&gt; lying via deception, the falsehood-teller denies that he is &quot;lying&quot;.  Etc.

If Kant has a satisfactory answer, I&#039;m not aware of it.]]></description>

Thank you.  Some hypotheticals deserve a good fight.  If only to point out just how far into the hypothetical realm they reside.]]></description>

Actually, the purpose that the maxim is directed at is canonically supposed to be part of the maxim for Kant. He just leaves it unstated in nearly all of his examples, at massive cost to clarity.]]></description>

That post is amazing. It expresses a lot of things about utilitarianism that make sense to me as though I have been thinking them all along even though I never quite put them into concepts so clear.]]></description>

The idea of a mixed strategy would be foreign to Kant, but truer to the spirit of universalization.  To wit, behind every maxim is a motive.  The motive indicates the Real Maxim.  The Real Maxim is then tested.  I think this is what Scott&#039;s trying to get at.

For example, if I offer the maxim &quot;everyone give all their money to someone named Paul Torek&quot; the Real Maxim is self-love.  As Scott discussed, this leads to Levi seeking money for Levi and Paula for Paula.

The Real Maxim in the nuclear terrorism case is &quot;save my city, extremely important, and if possible save my general too.&quot;  The mixed strategy captures that perfectly.]]></description>
