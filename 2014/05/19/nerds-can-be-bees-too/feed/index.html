Your point is good, but everyone else&#039;s point is good as well. I will put Multiheaded on probation. Next time after this he posts something really bad, he gets a three week ban (same escalation I used for James).]]></description>

I have noticed a trend of Piano turning almost every topic into very strongly phrased and very non-subtle versions of neoreactionary positions. I have also noticed some, er, unfortunate phrasing, like:

&quot;“Streaming is bad”? You and everyone else of your approximate IQ should commit suicide, how’s that for streaming? Without streaming, the less able slow down the more able, and you eventually get to the point where tards are “accomodated” into normal schools and everyone is miserable.&quot;

&quot;A woman being attracted to a masculine man is noble. Homosexuals are “fucked in the head”, to speak rashly. Being attracted to androgynous people is half that. This.&quot;

&quot;@Slow Learner. You live up to your name. Read every the words in parentheses...That solves what you’re pointlessly complaining about.&quot;

&quot;@all y’all “Fair distribution of sex” is solved by Christian marriage. Y’all make epicycles look like platonic solids.&quot;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Therefore, Piano is banned from commenting on this blog - him, his children, and his children&#039;s children - for one month&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]]></description>

Way down the chain from the comment that this is actually a reply to, but

&quot;Oh, no, I actually understand and to a certain extent “agree,” in the sense that, like, about 90% of dating-thoughts are liable to be something like Oh God What If I’m Doing Something Wrong and feminism can of course give you new things to be (aware that you are) wrong about. &quot;

To me, far more than giving specific things to be afraid of being wrong about, the paralyzing effect of feminist memes was the *non*specific things I worried about being wrong about. What instilled me with fear were not the item lists of things not to do which I would see and think &quot;Oh no, I&#039;ve done that!&quot; (because I bent over backwards to be careful, I avoided all the behaviors that anyone would think to put on a list,) they were the constant disclaimers that the lists were not exhaustive. And the reminders that people are offended by different things, and the onus is always on the person doing the offending not to, not on the person who is being offended to change their preferences. 

I was always careful, but carefulness need not to, and by all means shouldn&#039;t lead to paralysis. But being careful is never enough to prevent all mishaps, when you&#039;re dealing with wildly varying thresholds. What really became paralyzing was being constantly reinforced in the perception that acting with good intentions, exercising caution, and being considerate of others&#039; responses wasn&#039;t good enough. If I ended up offending someone regardless, it wasn&#039;t merely an unfortunate accident, I was *at fault,* and if I completely and gracefully acceded to any sort of rejection rather than attempting to defend the propriety of my actions, and the person continued to be offended anyway, then the sympathies of the communities where I was seeking guidance would mostly lie with the people who had suffered offense, no matter how extensively I had tried to prevent it. 

While not all the members of those communities would have ascribed to such an explicit formulation, this was the practical upshot, since with the Just World Fallacy laid over the constant preoccupation with guarding women from the unwanted advances of men who lacked respect for their personhood, absent a balancing interest in the concerns of men, the idea of a man being unjustly lambasted for failing to intuit a woman&#039;s idiosyncratic preferences *even after acceding to those preferences and withdrawing all advances,* would seem unworthy of serious consideration.]]></description>

@Piano

&#062;All you need for tech advance is a decent smart fraction, which we and other countries had. 

We didn&#039;t just advanced technologically.  Our whole economy  and society grew.  And if we hadn&#039;t had a nonsmart fraction to do menial jobs the smart fraction would have had to do them and not had time to advance technology. It&#039;s basic Comparative Advantage.

&#062;A woman being attracted to a masculine man is noble.

It is if she&#039;s attracted to other things in addition to his masculinity.  Being attracted to someone purely for their sexual characteristics is generally considered to be &quot;shallow.&quot; Shallowness is not regarded to be a noble trait, to say the least.

&#062;Homosexuals are “fucked in the head”, to speak rashly.

I&#039;d dispute that.  I&#039;d say that if a person&#039;s desires are fully ego-syntonic then they are not &quot;fucked in the head.&quot;  As far as I know most homosexual&#039;s desires are ego-syntonic.

&#062;Being attracted to androgynous people is half that.

If you mean that finding androgyny attractive is halfway to being homosexual, that is simply not true.  That theory would predict that homosexual men are primarily attracted to effeminate men, but in fact homosexual men are often attracted to manly, masculine men.  In fact, in the unlikely event you know anything about Japanese gay porn, you&#039;ll find that gay porn with androgynous men (yaoi) is targeted towards women, whereas gay porn with masculine men (bara) is targeted towards gay men.]]></description>

@Ghatanothoah 
All you need for tech advance is a decent smart fraction, which we and other countries had. Very smart people can get along better with other cultures than others, because they can better consciously hide racism etc. A woman being attracted to a masculine man is noble.

@Piano

who

Putnam is the guy who did the study that showed that there might be lowered trust in multicultural societies.

&#062;produced the present

You stated that multicultural societies are not successful if their IQ is too low.  I pointed out that if this statement was true then America should not have succeeded the way it did in the past.  This indicates the present stagnation has some other cause.

&#062;wat

That was just one example about how people are nicer than they used to be.

&#062;can’t fix bone structure

Actually it can, with some surgery.  But there are lots of other ways to be ugly beside bad bone structure (bad skin and teeth for instance) that health care has fixed.

&#062;masculinity not noble
explains a lot

I didn&#039;t say &lt;i&gt;being masculine&lt;/i&gt; was ignoble.  I said being attracted to someone just because they were masculine was ignoble.

&#062;i’m semi-fucked in the head
&#062;cool, I’m not

If I understand correctly you&#039;re saying that people who strenuously argue against NR ideas are &quot;semi-fucked in the head.&quot; I suspect that it is more likely the case that NR ideas are just terrible and poorly thought out.]]></description>
