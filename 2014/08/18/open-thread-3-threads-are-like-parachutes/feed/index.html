Then he doesn&#039;t need to ask. He can explicitly say, with his link to Patreon, that he discourages donations, especially from people not making a lot of money, and requests donations to a Givewell charity instead. But realistically, I will not bother to increase my charitable giving, and I would be happy to make a recurring donation to subsidize this blog. I would appreciate it if he would allow that.]]></description>

Those don&#039;t *quite* map to the trolley problem because they are of the form &quot;subset of group A dies as opposed to all of group A&quot; whereas the trolley problem is &quot;group B dies instead of group A,&quot; which is the part that makes the thought experiment feel problematic.]]></description>

I have a decidedly non-D&#038;D4E mechanics system specced out, if you guys are interested.

It also has a pseudorandom AI that&#039;s extremely simple to implement (it was originally designed to be implemented by hand, by smart 12 year olds, without a computer).]]></description>

Somewhat related, I once had the experience of a dream sorta-continuing after I woke up.  The dream became a lot less vivid than they usually are, but still I was relieved when it went away.  I agree about the sci fi and epistemological horror; I immediately thought that someone (with more talent than me) should write a fiction like this.  Only, obviously, the dream doesn&#039;t go away, at all, ever.  Or until the end of the story.  Or reality goes away.  Or they both go away; movie fades to black.  Or...]]></description>

Seconded.  Sortition gives extremists a little more hope than statsism, because there is always a chance that this year&#039;s legislature will be biased in the direction you favor.  And when it is, the legislation you favor will pass and everyone will see what a good idea it is.]]></description>

I&#039;m a big fan of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Methods of Rationality Podcast&lt;/a&gt;, which started off as an HPMOR audiobook but has since branched out into readings of other stories and essays. There&#039;s no original content (yet), and I&#039;m not sure if Eneasz plans to continue after HPMOR is done, but I hope he does.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Rationally Speaking&lt;/a&gt; is co-hosted by Julia Galef, president of CFAR, and produces some pretty good discussion. It&#039;s not SSC-level, and I am not a huge fan of Massimo, but it&#039;s about as good as you can get for a rational podcast right now (as far as I know).

Not quite in the same vein, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/127413729/podcast/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Planet Money&lt;/a&gt; is an economics podcast from NPR which I think the SSCosphere would enjoy as light listening. Their series on the creation of a t-shirt is, and I mean this sincerely, fascinating.]]></description>
