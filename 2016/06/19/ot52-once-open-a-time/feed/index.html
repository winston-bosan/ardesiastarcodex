If you want to keep it apples to apples, though, you&#039;re going to need to add some time to the 40 hour workweek for cooking, grocery shopping, etc.  Obviously that&#039;s not going to add up to 20 hours, but it&#039;s more than nothing.]]></description>

He was definitely on the right track.  We still see some traces of old Georgist policies in eg some American and Australian states.

However, I don&#039;t think I buy his account of recessions coming purely out of land speculation.  The market monetarists seem to have a better explanation there.

(Ideally we both finance government from land value taxes, and tell the central bank to target nominal GDP.)]]></description>

Alas, lots of people seem to believe that one man&#039;s gain is necessarily another man&#039;s loss.

If you hold that position, then you don&#039;t even think about how to increase the size of the pie.]]></description>

&quot;This should ensure an economically efficient allocation of refugees across countries&quot;

Only if the welfare of the refugees is left out of the calculation. They might have preferences between the U.S. and Mexico, say.]]></description>

I believe there is evidence for an ancient battery, although I don&#039;t know how good the evidence is, whether there is another plausible interpretation.

The obvious thing to do with a battery is electroplating--a lot easier, cheaper and safer than fire gilding.]]></description>

&quot;Responsible to whom? In what way? On what basis? Who or what enforces this responsibility?&quot;

&quot;Responsible&quot; meaning that it is your fault. Insofar as anything enforces the responsibility, it is your conscience.

Is the unstated assumption of your comment ethical nihilism, the idea that normative beliefs are all illusory?]]></description>

&quot;Yeah, celebrating other people getting torture for eternity is funny and not horribly sociopathic.&quot;

It isn&#039;t funny but it is interesting, given that what was being quoted was a reasonably traditional view of one of the world&#039;s more successful, in the past and present, religions. There is much to be said for a conversation including a sizable range of world views. 

The belief in an all powerful, all wise creator god raises interesting issues for a libertarian world view, despite which a fair number of libertarians are also theists.]]></description>

@GravShort: (not stalking you, cross my heart)

Accelerationism works great in contexts where the stakes are smaller: e.g. people leaving an organization, or getting thrown out of it (also known as &quot;getting fired&quot; in organizations that employ people).  This would be analogous to burning down the barn, as opposed to the world.

Maybe people who use the tactic repeatedly in smaller-stakes games are just reflexively reaching for it in higher-stakes contexts, without recognizing the shift in stakes and the accompanying increase in both the expected costs and the costs should the downside come to pass.

You can test this by seeing whether focusing on the high stakes actually makes them abandon (or give less support to) accelerationism.

Hey, Scott-and-all-the-other-mental-health-professionals-here, can&#039;t some family therapy approaches be semi-fairly described as accelerationism?  Basically getting people into a big argument in the therapist&#039;s office (where it&#039;s safe) so as to demonstrate how the existing dynamic just can&#039;t go on?]]></description>

@Gravitas Shortfall:

Do you want a President Trump?

Because &lt;i&gt;that&#039;s&lt;/i&gt; how you get a President Trump.

(We had a long, not-always-productive thread about this in the context of the UK leaving the EU.)]]></description>
