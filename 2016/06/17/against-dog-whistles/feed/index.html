&lt;blockquote&gt;Going through the field of Republican canditates it strikes me that I don’t recall anyone, other than Trump, making remarks about Carly Fiorina, but I revall lots of comments about Cruz’ punchable face. And bot Christie and Huckabee have been targets for weight comments most of their careers. When I think about who does and who does not attract appearance comments, it’s not so much sex as how much you deviate from the standards of conventional attractiveness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is the usual pattern. When people say &quot;Women are unfairly targeted by $THING&quot;, what it almost always means is &quot;Women are targeted much, much less by $THING than men are, but since I view women as innately precious and cherishable and men as innately disposable and degrading, I get upset and remember it when it happens to women and do not become upset and do not remember it when it happens to men.&quot;

It&#039;s exactly the same kind of thinking that leads activists to say that it&#039;s proof of how much society hates and threatens women when 25% of the homeless in a region are women, or 10% of murder victims in El Salvador are women. They are literally and not figuratively incapable of perceiving bad things happening to men, and so always conclude women are disproportionately victims, even though this is never true.]]></description>

Anonymous, it&#039;s a blue tribe school in a very blue area, and if I misunderstood or misremember, the same is true of others who attended that school.

You seem very determined to believe that blue tribe couldn&#039;t possibly speak that way. Why? Is your logic &quot;that phrase is anti-Semitic, and blue tribe isn&#039;t&quot;? Because if so, you might consider believing me when I say that no, that phrase is perfectly normal.]]></description>

I think it depends on how sarcastic the remark is. Someone who repeatedly judges all women after an encounter with an individual woman probably has some sexist tendencies. But if said in a clearly facetious way, then it just means they have a (perhaps off-key) sense of humor and aren&#039;t necessarily sexist at all.]]></description>

I absolutely think all the small hands talk is trying to emasculate him in the eyes of his supporters, who are thought (by those invoking small hands) to be especially likely to find small hands/effeminate qualities on men de-legitimizing. 

It&#039;s very unfortunate, the whole thing.]]></description>

As others have commented, I don&#039;t see this as a motte and bailey. 

If I have a broad definition of racism that includes actions motivated by both (1) belief in some sort of Darwinian racial hierarchy and (2) a (perhaps unconscious) desire to increase my in-group status via the subordination of blacks, I might very well think both are evil. And it certainly doesn&#039;t seem some sleight of hand is going on when I include both under a definition of racism. 

As for boorishness being sexist -- same thing. When someone says boorishness is sexist, they aren&#039;t relying on some strict definition at all. And when challenged, I&#039;m sure they are happy to explain their very broad understanding of what counts as sexist. 

The motte and bailey fallacy isn&#039;t happening here, or at least not necessarily.]]></description>

It wasn&#039;t even that much of a gaffe. &quot;Misunderestimated&quot; is a bad word, but &quot;overhyped&quot; and &quot;overexaggerated&quot; are bad in precisely the same way and I see people using them all the time.]]></description>

&quot;Misunderestimated&quot; was not a gaffe. It was a tongue-in-cheek mockery of the people who were misunderestimating him, and they were too blinded by superiority to notice. It sums up his entire political career in a single word - it sounds stupid, and it pisses off the self-described elites, but it&#039;s really not stupid at all.]]></description>
