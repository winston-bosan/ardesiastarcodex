					<description><![CDATA[Very overdue, but I noticed someone saying that the Cavaliers were pro-Nazi; but _Albion&#039;s Seed_ relates how they were eager to join WWII on the Allied side, to defend their old ally England. The book relates that all four of the core cultures had their own reasons to join the war: the Puritans welcomed the chance to crush a rival theocracy; the Cavaliers wanted to protect England; the Scotch-Irish, with their warrior spirit, didn&#039;t have to be asked twice after Pearl Harbor; and the Quakers could get behind the idea of non-violently supporting a war against the warrior spirit. (Note the Quaker/Scotch-Irish tension there...)

At the time, pro-neutrality sentiment was mostly confined to peoples outside the core cultures (New York in particular; the New York Times was defeatist for almost the entire duration of the war, and inexplicably buried stories about Nazi atrocities), and outright pro-Nazi sentiment tended to be confined to people very much on the fringes -- see http://harpers.org/archive/1941/08/who-goes-nazi/ for the general feeling at the time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/27/book-review-albions-seed/#comment-350297&quot;&gt;Alsadius&lt;/a&gt;.

Subbak:
Denmark ran into a similar irreconcilability issue back in 1989 (since certain international treaties bind countries to recognize each other&#039;s marriages) and we also didn&#039;t want to upset the other Nordics too much (and the conservatives were talking about our reputation as a country). The way this was solved was by inventing so-called &quot;registreret partnerskab&quot; (registered partnership, basically a civil union) where same-sex couples could have the usual kind of paperwork-signing-at-the-municipality-office wedding (&quot;usual&quot; is not sarcastic, it&#039;s quite common), but not be married in the church (Danish state church). We were very close to getting a whole different law there, though, where anyone living together with a partner of any gender would receive the right tax benefits etc. In the time afterwards, some churches came up with &quot;partnership blessing&quot; rituals which looked very much like marriage. Then in 2012 (!) Danish politicians somehow realized that we didn&#039;t have &quot;real&quot; gay marriage yet (also something with adoption rights, but it&#039;s simpler to think of it as signal politics) and, quite simply, wrote registered partnerships out of the law (though with an exception to convert an existing registered partnership to a real marriage), and (here&#039;s the cool part) added a small new clause to the existing marriage laws saying that any law regarding someone of specific gender in a marriage doesn&#039;t count for same-sex marriages, and that other countries aren&#039;t bound to respect our same-sex marriages.
This, however, had an interesting result: now that same-sex marriage was officially exactly like any other marriage, this also meant gay people had the right to a church wedding. Some of the priests were pretty pissed, and church minister basically said &quot;you&#039;re government employees, deal with it&quot;.

This turned into a long comment, but my main point is that the gay marriage irreconcilability issue isn&#039;t actually much of one, given that civil unions don&#039;t legally count as marriage outside of states that recognize them, but can be made arbitrarily close to marriage.]]></description>

Right, but one strategic choke point is populated by smart efficient economical Chinese, and the other is, ummmmm,                                       &quot;Evil Formerly slave-trading Caucausians&quot;?

					<description><![CDATA[A point of clarification: the Pilgrims that you probably associate with Thanksgiving were not Puritans, they were Separatists. They wanted to be separate from the Church of England, while the Puritans wanted to &quot;purify&quot; the church according to their doctrines. The Separatists didn&#039;t like the Puritans and actually banned their church in the settlement at Plimoth (modern spelling: Plymouth) IIRC.

The First Thanksgiving involved the Pilgrims. The Puritans came to Massachusetts later (and soon outnumbered the Separatists). And neither group wore hats with buckles on them, in case anyone was imagining them like that. That was an artist&#039;s misconception. They all wore typical clothes for English people at the time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;I&gt;90% of Puritan names were taken from the Bible. Some Puritans took pride in their learning by giving their children obscure Biblical names they would expect nobody else to have heard of, like Mahershalalhasbaz.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/27/book-review-albions-seed/#comment-351740&quot;&gt;hlynkacg&lt;/a&gt;.

&quot;And if you look at the military course of the war, it wasn’t like the Russians were winning until the revolution. They’d gotten their heads handed to them at Port Arthur and at sea.&quot;

So the Russians don&#039;t have the sea. Given time they&#039;d still crush the Japanese on land. The Japanese had scored a massive and decisive victory against the Russians on land... and the Russian army still outnumbered them!

The Japanese did not have a good position. They had neither the manpower nor the money to fight a long war. That is why they accepted the peace terms, even though they got very little of what they wanted.

&quot;The Finns lost in the end, but they did a truly impressive amount of damage on the way. Look at the relative casualties, and think about what would happen if the Soviets tried to pick on someone larger and with greater strategic depth.&quot;

The Russians attacked strong defensive positions in the middle of the winter fighting an enemy using partisan tactics. That isn&#039;t going to occur in Manchuria.

&quot;I’m aware of Khalkhin Gol, but that doesn’t mean the Japanese would have gone down easily on the defensive.&quot;

Why? 

&quot;Also, the Soviets had no particular reason to intervene in the Pacific.&quot;

This is presuming Japan invades the USSR, remember? 

&quot;Korea, coast of Manchuria, Vladivostok, Magadan, and so on. There’s a lot of coast up there.&quot;

The first two only matter if the Red Army crushes the IJA. In which case marines are pretty irrelevant because the Japanese just lost their field army. The second is going to be fortified by the Red Army and is a relatively small area. Stalin does not care if the people in Magadan live or die so threatening it or the other gulags is of no strategic relevance. The USSR has a couple tons less gold.

&quot;I’m not sure the U-boat war brings in the US automatically. It was well-established that submarines could sink escorted ships. US ships were barred by law from entering the war zone. If the Germans stick to the war zone, the British have nothing to legally complain about, and the US isn’t losing ships.&quot;

Didn&#039;t the Neutrality Acts only cover war material?

&quot;The US supplied a large portion of British manufactured goods. Not being able to buy those puts a huge dent in their economy. Possibly a fatal one.&quot;

You are thinking about this wrong. The question is &quot;do the British need those good to run the factories making tanks, planes and ships&quot;. And the more important question is &quot;does England have enough food&quot;? I know the second one was historically a close run thing.

&quot;So long as the Japanese don’t manage to damage the railroad itself.&quot;

In Manchuria or China? Those are both more numerous (so you can use alternate routes) and easier to repair (because there are a lot of people who live near by and the climate is not as horrible).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great review!  I just have a little fleshing out of one of his points.

&quot;And what happened to all of those indentured servants the Cavaliers brought over after slavery put them out of business?”  

We saw lots of them pass through our rural Eastern North Carolina school in the 1950s.  They were the children of sharecroppers.  The poorest and the dumbest of them were there only a couple or so years, to be replaced by the children of other itinerant tenant farmers. Most of them quit school as soon as it was legal to do so, at age 16, and never graduated from high school. 

&quot;My guess is going to be that the indentured servants and the Borderer population mixed pretty thoroughly, and that this stratum was hanging around providing a majority of the white bodies in the South while the plantation owners were hogging the limelight – but I just  don’t know.”

He guessed wrong on that one.  The former indentured servants remained in the flatlands and the borderers in the hill and mountain country, without much intermixing. I don’t thing the writer has much personal familiarity with the South.]]></description>
