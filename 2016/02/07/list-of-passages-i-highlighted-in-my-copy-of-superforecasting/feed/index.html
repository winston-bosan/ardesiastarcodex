Actually, I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlBa7LN08mk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;another talk&lt;/a&gt; where Hannam says something like what Machine Interface attributes to him:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In fact, they had no way of testing whether their science worked, at all. They had no experimental method, except for one or two exceptions, which never seemed to catch on as a movement. As far as the Greeks were concerned, the way that you do science is that you think about things very, very, very hard. And when you thought about something that hard, it must be true because it’s completely rational. And unfortunately, that means that when you get two clever people who disagree, they’ve got absolutely no way to tell which of them is right, because they both thought very hard. So Greek science is an awful lot of extremely clever theories with no way of telling which one is right.

I suspect the nature of the task was to predict one off events like whether a country will go to war in a given year or if a depression will occur.

In the coin flip example we assume that, even though it may be in principle determined, in practice there is an upper bound on the amount of information we can get about it&#039;s result (it&#039;s bias) and that actual experts may be able to exhaust that information.

Attempts to predict world events are just the opposite.  There doesn&#039;t seem to be any practical upper bound on how certain we can be about an outcome (surely there are such upper bounds but any serious expert won&#039;t be generating probabilities even remotely bumping up against them) and the extent of the information about these events is so large that no expert could fully exhaust the predictive information in the publicly available data.

This creates a situation where each expert is focusing in on some predictive information and ignoring others.  Thus, if two experts each reach a 70% probability estimate while each ignored information the other relied on the (assuming, plausibly, that factors predicting an event usually interact positively) it makes sense to estimate a greater than 70% chance of the event.

The difficulty is figuring out just how much more since it will likely vary by the type of problem being considered.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I participated in one of Tetlock&#039;s forecasting teams, so maybe this can shed a little light on why they succeeded.

I really liked Tetlock&#039;s book Expert Political Judgement and I&#039;m in a field that frequently has to make similar types of predictions. So when Marginal Revolution mentioned there was this contest I got really excited and signed up for Tetlock&#039;s group. I was interested in testing my skills (obviously amazing!) and seeing what I could learn that could be applied to my job. A week or two later Tyler Cowen mentioned that Robin Hanson was setting up a group, too.  He had a power point presentation explaining what their approach was going to be and it was extremely interesting. Really cool stuff.  However, since I had already signed up for one team I couldn&#039;t switch teams. I think one of the big reasons all the other groups underperformed and dropped out was that Tetlock had a far bigger group (I suspect, although don&#039;t know for sure) since he announced first and had the star power.  People who are excited about making accurate predictions probably know who Tetlock is and want to work for his team.

Making predictions was a slog.  There were so many frickin questions, and I knew nothing about most of them.  At best I could google a few stories, read them, and then make a rough judgement on based on my cursory reading.  I never felt like I had enough time to really understand the issues and perspectives.  He points out that the best people constantly update their predictions, but that just makes the time commitment way worse.  Like, of course updating helps.  If it&#039;s a 1% daily probability something happens, as you get close to the date it should go down if it keeps not happening.  But that&#039;s a pain in the ass and takes a ton of time even if you&#039;re not incorporating new information like you should.  I was lucky if I updated once.  Turns out I did pretty good. Like, above average, which I considered a success given how behind I was and how little time I devoted to each question.

The next year was better because you could read other people&#039;s opinions, which made it easier to synthesize the arguments and vote quicker.  But, I was burned out and dropped out partway into the year.  I&#039;m sure the reason that people who put 22% are way more accurate than the people who put 40% is because the &quot;40%&quot; guy is just guessing and it&#039;s really low information. The difference in thought between average and devoted people is super high.

I think it shows a couple things.  1.  It&#039;s not surprising that most of the superforecasters had a bunch of time on their hands.  He dismisses this at one point in the book, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s fair.  Being great takes a lot of time, and there are definitely rewards to simple diligence of 1-2 hours a day. It might not be a job, but it&#039;s a full time hobby. 2. Tetlock had the critical mass to create the superforecaster groups. This allowed them to create a culture of people who devoted a lot of time to it, invested their ego in succeeding, and were spending time talking to people who had the right attitudes that were conducive to accurate forecasting.

A lot of organizations recognize that they succeed not because of their structure, but because of the people.  I suspect the same thing is going on with Tetlock, where he had enough people who were excellent to make some strong teams. The aggregation and extremizing was the easy stuff.

This was the GMU approach I mentioned above.

I skimmed Hannam’s book, looking for discussion of the ancients. He is actually pretty careful about not talking about Greek thought, because it’s not relevant to his medieval topic.

However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLBUHdA-FG0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this talk&lt;/a&gt; is explicitly about ancient Greek vs medieval Christian science. I have a huge number of complaints about it. It contains many false claims about the Greeks. But all those pale to nothing before Machine Interface’s 

&lt;blockquote&gt;the greek method of accessing knowledge through pure reasoning was wholy inadequate and that observation, experiment and measurement were needed&lt;/blockquote&gt;

whereas, Hannam:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Their scientific methodology, really typified by Aristotle, was to use a method of observation and deduction. And they could be very, very fine observers. We have some fantastic descriptions of the prognosis of disease… But there was no tradition of experiment in ancient Greece. And Aristotle’s method of observation and deduction could not generate useful knowledge. The most tragic example of that is Greek medicine, which was, if no useless, positive harmful. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLBUHdA-FG0&#038;t=11m50s&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;11:50&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So Hannam says that Greek science was all about observation, not pure thought. And diagnosis is one of the successes of Greek science, almost opposite to MI’s memory of Hannam.

So that’s Hannam. I would go further and say that the Hellenistic Greeks were far more enthusiastic about experiment than medieval Christians. Many of my examples are things that he does mention. So while he makes many factual errors, I am much more concerned that he applies double standards for this and many other comparisons.

Experiment is such a vague concept that it is not productive to argue about. But Hannam made the much more concrete claim that this putative deficiency of Greek science made it incapable of discovering useful interventions. A great counterexample to this is the work Aristotle’s successor, Theophrastus, on plants. Maybe Aristotle’s work on animals was pure observation and pure knowledge of no practical value, but Theophrastus’s books contained many practical interventions which quickly spread over the Mediterranean. This not physics and engineering, but something as messy as medicine. Medical treatment is a definite failure of Greek (and medieval!) science, but it&#039;s just one example.]]></description>

The British intelligence services worked very well in the Cold War - all the Oxbridge communists were highly effective at collecting information on British government and military preparations and passing it to the Soviets - they just weren&#039;t on Britain&#039;s side. Not a problem in WWII as very few Oxbridge graduates were sympathetic to National Socialism.]]></description>

How many people were being killed by quacks in the 19th century? More than now, I wager, but I&#039;m sure it didn&#039;t come close to the numbers being killed by Tuberculosis.

People generally have an interest in buying treatments that work and won&#039;t kill them. The typical response is that anyone can sell hope to a dying man, but dying men tend to die anyway. Is it good to stop someone profiting unfairly from another&#039;s misery, if the cost is retarding the progress of medical science?

And this is with the rather unfair assumption that no FDA means unlimited legal quackery. In fact, quacks who outright lie or materially mislead have always been guilty of fraud. The FDA is primarily about &quot;protecting&quot; people from making contracts that they genuinely, with full knowledge of what they are doing, think are a good idea, but which imply some risk for them. About banning your doctor from saying, &quot;Look, this might not work, or might have terrible side effects, but it also might cure you. We can try it.&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For what it&#039;s worth, I&#039;d say Silver&#039;s most impressive accomplishment isn&#039;t predicting which party/candidate would win each state, but that 48 of 50 states had percentage share gaps (between winner and second place) within his 95% confidence interval by state. Literally could not have been better calibrated.]]></description>

The trouble with a war after Iraq rolls over the Arabian Peninsula is geography.  In the Gulf War, the troop buildup was in Saudi Arabia.  In the Iraq War, the troop buildup was in Kuwait.  Assuming Iraq rolled over the whole Arabian Peninsula, where would the US/UK build up their forces for the invasion?

Iran and Syria hardly were going to allow US troop buildups in their countries, whatever their desire to see Hussein knocked down.  Jordan opposed the Gulf War; they might be able to be convinced to be used as a staging area, but it&#039;s hardly certain.  Similarly, Turkey neither participated in nor allowed ground forces to operate from its territory in either the Gulf War or Iraq War, though it allowed air units in the Gulf War.  That would leave . . . . . . a difficult amphibious operation across the Red Sea from Djibouti or something, or from Diego Garcia direct across the Indian Ocean.

Anyway.  It would be uncertain there would be any ally from which to launch a ground invasion, amphibious operations are just plain difficult, and a 1991-style destruction of the Kuwait oilfields extended to the oilfields of the whole peninsula would be a major shock to the world economy.  Which might be enough to convince Hussein he can pull it off, even if the US leaders privately know they would 100% do whatever it takes to dislodge him in such a case.

So, assume you estimate, say, a 20% chance of Hussein taking the gamble that it would be too difficult to dislodge him after he seized the peninsula, with all sorts of bad consequences even if you do remove him in response.  Isn&#039;t it tempting to reduce that to 0% with a short war with few allied deaths?

If I&#039;m right, the mistake that the Bush Administration made was not military, but political.  Rumsfeld, the SecDef who was a former SecDef; Cheney, the VP who was a former SecDef; Rice, the National Security Advisor who was an academic expert in foreign policy; and Powell, the SecState who was a general -- they put together a perfectly competent military plan to solve two major foreign policy problems.  Which worked; in five weeks and with 172 Coalition military fatalities, Hussein was ended as a threat and the US could get its boots off the holy soil of Arabia permanently.

But to launch their short, effective little war, they needed to sell it to the public.  And the way they sold it, the lies that were told (thought of as just exaggerations; Hussein was a psychopath, WMD seemed to be real, and we&#039;d certainly make the postwar government nominally democratic for a while) dragged the US into a long, expensive quagmire.]]></description>

&lt;I&gt;The use of an inanimate subject with a verb normally associated with an animate one (“the doors open at 8”).&lt;/I&gt;

Good addition to a good list.]]></description>
