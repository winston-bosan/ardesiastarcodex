					<description><![CDATA[The correlations between IQ and various other &quot;positive&quot; indices raise a paradox: why does IQ exhibit additive heritability? As you notice, there do not seem to be tradeoffs between IQ and other traits; and IQ has probably undergone extensive positive selection. 

One possibility is that IQ = mutation load, and variation is the result of mutation-selection balance. Another is that the positive manifold is really not so extensive as most psychologists think, so IQ-type cognitive abilities were not important to success until very recently.]]></description>

Regarding development at birth for various species - be careful to consider litter size, and don&#039;t assume too much based on generalities.

Litter bearers tend to have smaller young because they are carrying many more at a time, and the more young at one time, the less developed they are at birth. (With cod being the ur-example of quantity over quality.)

Also - european rabbits are born more blind and helpless than puppies.  However, jackrabbits are a precocious species, as are guinea pigs.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/04/myers-race-car-versus-the-general-fitness-factor/#comment-353421&quot;&gt;Tom Hunt&lt;/a&gt;.

There are plenty of examples of &quot;super smart&quot; people that don&#039;t have exceptionally high reaction times--or even exceptionally high IQs.  (I don&#039;t have a citation, but a visit to a top university will prove this point quickly.)  So I wouldn&#039;t use reaction times as a gauge for what&#039;s possible with general intelligence.  Certainly as you go across species, reaction times aren&#039;t a good measure for overall intelligence, which proves there must be other extremely important factors in intelligence.

It&#039;s entirely possible that neuron signalling efficiency is the dominate source of variance in &lt;i&gt;today&#039;s human population&lt;/i&gt;.  But as the population distribution changes (whether from natural selection, or a genetic engineering program), the dominate source of variance may change.]]></description>

&quot;Not sure why one example of modifying for one type of physical extreme is a rat race, and the other is not.&quot;

Because the advantage of height in basketball is entirely positional. 

&quot;I assume that this genetic modification thing will be expensive and unusual, so there would likely be fewer peers.&quot;

Why? Rich people aren&#039;t going to use a completely untested procedure and it isn&#039;t clear why this would be substantially more expensive than IVF.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t noticed any discussion here of Heinlein&#039;s ingenious idea for what I think of as libertarian eugenics–let couples choose, from among the children they could have, which ones they do have. Do it by selecting separately on egg and sperm, combining the egg that has the mother&#039;s musical ability and doesn&#039;t have her poor circulation with the sperm that has the father&#039;s good memory and doesn&#039;t have his bad heart. That avoids a lot of the problems with other versions of eugenics, but could produce quite rapid improvement.

How do you tell what genes are in a sperm or egg without destroying it? You get the full genetics from any ordinary cell. Produce egg or sperm in vitro, destructively analyze the bodies thrown off in the process without touching egg or sperm, and subtract.
