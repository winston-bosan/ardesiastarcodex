					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/02/be-nice-at-least-until-you-can-coordinate-meanness/#comment-352199&quot;&gt;Tracy W&lt;/a&gt;.

There&#039;s some reasons for disproportionate punishments to intimidating actions /implied threats, that I&#039;d like to lay out:

1. Most defections are not punished. There are few enough people who are willing and able to take the physical (and legal) risk to put a disincentivising stop to bad behaviour. The more such people there are, the less disproportionate responses have to be, but the reason this guy is rampaging around like that is because there are not many such people. &quot;lunatic Vigilantes&quot; are the only unpredictable threat that such people face. A population sprinkled with them is massively more resistant to intimidation, extortion, riots, etc.

2. A directly proportionate response is not a disincentive. If I am a thief, -even a really incompetent thief who gets caught two thirds of the time, and all I have to do is pay back the money when I get caught, then I have no (outside) incentive to stop stealing. If I have to pay back twice the money, all i have to be i a marginally competent thief (51%+ success rate) for this to remain an industry my society encourages me to go into. If I&#039;m a really competent thief, -95% success rate, the punishment has to, before even getting into any other factors, be 20 times disproportionate to make thieving an even-expected-utility action.

3. pushing people around and getting away with it is not just pushing people around. It is a live oppurtunity to transition from your position of tyrant into violence, theft, rape, etc.

4. Little old ladies are not universally psychologically prepared to be around violence, and the implied threat of more. The harm done to the old lady is not primarily that she was moved several feet several times against her will, (though that is dangerous if she is frail), it&#039;s that a lunatic deliberately put her in close contact with his willingness to be violent, -in a position where she was helpless to stop him. And this lack of psychological preparedness is not a unique feature of little old laides.

5. Intimidation is also a thing. If there is an 80% certainty that over the course of this guy&#039;s life, he gets away with it, and that if he doesn&#039;t all that happens is he goes to jail, it&#039;s psychologically a lot harder for the little old lady to avoid fear, -she is much more likely reduced to the status of a non combatant. If there are genuine threats to the minityrant, it&#039;s much easier to adopt the mantle of soldier. It&#039;s the difference between waiting and hoping for the cavalry to arrive, and waiting to die, leaving it entirely in the hands of a demonstrating sadist.

5. Humans are often overconfident. If someone has a 95% success rate at their favoured anti-other-people activity (and probably 100% so far), but believes they have a 99%, 99.9%, or 100% success rate, putting them off doing so

6. For many people, violence is existentially satisfying. If it&#039;s not just about potential profits, but about being a hard man who doesn&#039;t shrink from the true face of the world, nor the risks, who &quot;sees&quot; that e.g. only wolves prosper among sheep, and only the strongest most worthy wolves, then you&#039;re talking about a whole different level of necessarry incentive. Unfortunately  criminal&#039;s / traitor&#039;s ideologies are strong forces in the real world.

7. Lowlifes and degenerates are not known for being particularly well attuned to subtle messages. They believe that force is a language, and that it trumps all others. Unfortunately, this is a very workable model of the world, and one highly resistant to being refuted except on its own terms (but not the individual acolyte&#039;s own terms, of course).

8. Humans don&#039;t like to see injustice paraded around, especially if it&#039;s injustice against them. There&#039;s a difference between a crime carried out surrepticiously, and one carried out of people for being too gentle to. Even purely on aesthetic grounds, what could be more appropriate than to prove them gravely mistaken? 

Intimidation is not just a temptation, or a profiteering thing, often enough it&#039;s a creed, and it begs out for the incidental, but final, refutation of an appropriate response.

&#160;

The only contention I might have with the above post is the possible implication that there were not higher levels of force which would have been, in an ultimate sense, more appropriate (though perhaps not in practice). I don&#039;t applaud his christian restraint, except insofar as it is a necessity in a society that thinks violence ought to be the monopoly of criminals, and men in wigs.

Nonetheless, and I mean that literally, none the less, I thank him for his service in defence of country, and what could after all have been my grandmother, -or even just my brother or father.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The more I think about this, the more unworkable it seems.

A universal call to &quot;be nice&quot; runs into problems as soon as we have rivalrous claims of what it means to be &quot;nice.&quot;  It may not be &quot;nice&quot; to keep Trans people&#039;s out of bathrooms of the gender they identify with. Others see it not &quot;nice&quot; to enter a bathroom that some had expected and were comfortable only with those who are anatomically of the same gender.

So, to make this system workable, we have to invalidate one of the claims. Instead of negotiating a compromise, those with the most cultural power have a total victory. Not only must those concerned about unisex bathrooms lose on this particular issue, they must also have their concerns invalidated as bigotry, hatred, and fear-mongering.

And, I don&#039;t think the proposed solution of &quot;organizing&quot; meanness makes things better. It seems this leads to things like passing ham-fisted laws rather than working things out on an individual level, and raising the stakes to the point where each side feels they have to dig in. My suspicion is that the people of North Carolina could have worked out better arrangements than the current Last Stand of the Culture War we&#039;re witnessing now.]]></description>

I&#039;m way late here, but &quot;husband&quot; is Saxon/Old Norse for roughly &quot;the freeman of the house&quot;; the hus- part is the same as in hussy (= housewife). In Swedish, for example, &quot;husbonde&quot; is still a word meaning &quot;master of the house&quot; or &quot;the man a servant works for&quot; and just &quot;bonde&quot; on its own means &quot;farmer&quot;.]]></description>

It isn&#039;t extremely expensive and you can do it yourself. At least for the population under discussion. The rich  are a different story, but temporarily embarrassed millionaires aside, that&#039;s not relevant to the discussion.

Also, I like that Atwood thinks his ancestors found an empty desert with no one living there and turned in into a land flowing with milk and honey. Good story, but seems a bit derivative IMO.]]></description>

Shame is bad.  The problem&#039;s not that Dan broke the build; the problem is that &lt;b&gt;the build is broken&lt;/b&gt;.  So a red flashing light indicating that we all have a problem is far preferable to a chicken or wrench or dunce cap indicating that Dan has/is a problem.

It should be everyone&#039;s top priority to get the build un-broken ASAP.  Maybe at first only a couple of people can pitch in usefully; that&#039;s OK, but they should be able to pull in others as needed.  (And don&#039;t underestimate the efficiency of simply reverting to the last working build and integrating Dan&#039;s stuff again.)

Next step is to figure out &lt;b&gt;why&lt;/b&gt; the build broke on the build server: did it work on Dan&#039;s machine?  Are there tests that only intermittently fail (that is, only intermittently do their job)?  Is something different about the configuration on Dan&#039;s box and the build server?

<p>Shame is bad.  The problem&#8217;s not that Dan broke the build; the problem is that <b>the build is broken</b>.  So a red flashing light indicating that we all have a problem is far preferable to a chicken or wrench or dunce cap indicating that Dan has/is a problem.</p>
<p>It should be everyone&#8217;s top priority to get the build un-broken ASAP.  Maybe at first only a couple of people can pitch in usefully; that&#8217;s OK, but they should be able to pull in others as needed.  (And don&#8217;t underestimate the efficiency of simply reverting to the last working build and integrating Dan&#8217;s stuff again.)</p>
<p>Next step is to figure out <b>why</b> the build broke on the build server: did it work on Dan&#8217;s machine?  Are there tests that only intermittently fail (that is, only intermittently do their job)?  Is something different about the configuration on Dan&#8217;s box and the build server?</p>
<p>Whatever the answer, make sure to fix <b>that</b>, with the same urgency that you fixed the build.</p>
