Is it possible that it&#039;s just being healthy (and well-aging) positively correlates with electability? I.e. not that presidents live longer but people that would live longer get to be elected. And maybe before TV age looking healthy wasn&#039;t as important :)]]></description>

One of the early fields in which Big Data was publicly available was baseball player encyclopedias:

Soc Sci Q. 2008 Jul 17; 89(3): 817â€“830.

Major League Baseball Playersâ€™ Life Expectancies*
Jarron M. Saint Onge, Richard G. Rogers, and Patrick M. Krueger

We examine the importance of anthropometric and performance measures, and age, period, and cohort effects in explaining life expectancies among major league baseball (MLB) players over the past century.

Methods

We use discrete time hazard models to calculate life tables with covariates with data from Total Baseball, a rich source of information on all players who played in the major league.

Results

Compared to 20-year-old U.S. males, MLB players can expect almost five additional years of life. Height, weight, handedness, and player ratings are unassociated with the risk of death in this population of highly active and successful adults. Career length is inversely associated with the risk of death, likely because those who play longer gain additional incomes, physical fitness, and training.]]></description>

&lt;i&gt;And she wets the bed, which is a sign of sexual abuse&lt;/i&gt;

Not a very good sign.   I know several people, including close family members, who suffered from nocturnal enuresis during childhood and adolescence, to the point where it was causing severe family stress and was causing crippling social isolation (teenagers will not have friends over, and can&#039;t go on overnight fieldtrips or camping trips, if they are plagued with this problem), that I very certain they were not sexually abused as a child.]]></description>

Have you read &quot;The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains&quot; by Nicholas Carr? The book&#039;s main argument would agree with what you wrote. He gives an example at one point of a study comparing users working with easier (more tools, shortcuts, guidance, and hints) programs vs. more difficult ones for some given task, and the users with the harder program came up with better, more elegant solutions, were more able to accomplish the task without computers, etc. I haven&#039;t checked the original studies he cited, though.]]></description>

Guys, don&#039;t forget selection bias. Being sick often will probably make you less successful and less wealthy, while at the same time often leading to an earlier death.
Also, people tend to amass money over the course of their life. If you die young, you simply have less time to get rich.
Inheritance might compensate this to some extent, but I would be very surprised if it did so completely.
Always keep in mind that the effect you&#039;re trying to explain might be spurious before coming up with explanations.

This does not explain the early deaths of (earlier) presidents, but then again, small sample size. And, as Nassim Taleb points out, one of the most effective legal ways to kill someone is to assign them a personal doctor :)]]></description>

Awesome comment. 

Can you share your Excel spreadsheet using Google docs or something?  Would love to take a gander and check out individual presidents, causes of death, and so on, in one sheet.]]></description>
