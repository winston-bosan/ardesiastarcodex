&quot;Also, short of forcing people to take up medicine at gunpoint, I’m not sure that we could increase the output of doctors all that much. What would you suggest?&quot;

To Harry, I would suggest

(i) Reconsideration of credential requirements of doctors, and

(ii) Reconsideration of institutional disincentives to potential doctors.

[With &quot;doctors&quot; being a placeholder for &quot;providers of medical advice and care&quot; in a broad sense that would include psychologists, coaches, nurse practioners, and perhaps many other things we might be able to imagine.]]]></description>

It&#039;s one thing to be floridly delusional and yet another to have the specific delusion that would mean you would fail of &lt;I&gt;mens rea&lt;/I&gt;.

Grammar does not in fact dictate ontology, as witness that literally anything can be cast as &quot;being TERM&quot;.  If I go for a walk, I am being a person going for a walk, making &quot;a person going for a walk&quot; a status by that argument.

First off, of course someone like Feynman could choose to lie, but he&#039;s disinclined to because he&#039;s keeping track of what&#039;s being said, and responding as if we should speak English to each other, rather than go-along-to-get-along -ese. That&#039;s the kind of person he is. Without people who see the importance of truth, or are otherwise against the degradation of &quot;consensus reality&quot;, there&#039;s no force against self indulgence, self interest, narrow mindedness, or any of a million things constantly chipping away at the sanity of, and constricting, &quot;the consensus&quot;.


-It&#039;s not a case of being pedantically honest. It&#039;s a case of being dedicated to the principle of honesty. If that causes you to fail a psych test, the problem is with the psych test, not with a person choosing to simplify their lives by always being literally and directly honest, or choosing not to pander to bullshit of the highest order.

You can consider this a quixotic and ridiculous position on the benefits of literal communication if you&#039;re particulary short sighted, but what it absolutely fucking isn&#039;t, is a mental illness.

Personally, I&#039;m willing to lie if it&#039;s convenient, and I&#039;m not inclined to contradict people when they&#039;re wrong, unless it&#039;s necessarry. But without people who are willing to maintain the truth for it&#039;s own sake, it&#039;s a slow downward slide, because the beneficial effects of a less deluded society are long term and hard to track, aka &quot;nebulous&quot; or &quot;imaginary&quot;, in the mouth of any half assed demagogue, asshole, or moron, while there are a million selfish and stupid reasons to lie or delude yourself right now.

People with attitudes leaning in that direction are a necessary counterbalance against people like that psychologist. If people are weak, self indulgent and selfish, there&#039;s a natural slide away from truth. Enough people are those things that we need people who are willing to shunt things right back to truth around. They are important. If they&#039;re happy to do so, and if they decide to make doing so their default mode of existence, rather than something they calculatedly do, or shift gears into, when necessary, that&#039;s even better.]]></description>

Mark Atwood that argument looks fairly close to circular. Surely resisting mental trauma is a sign of good mental health, ipso facto? So one has to delineate in which cases it&#039;s a sign of bad mental health. Imo these cases can be modelled as cases in which someone such should &quot;break down and catch fire&quot;, reevalute their whole life, and dedicate it henceforth either to charity or a noose.

Imo the important point is the distinction between killing and murder. Killing is by default wrong, but it can be the best of bad options, and it can even be straightforwardly right, e.g. assassinating hitler (he got really lucky in avoiding death by this means. I&#039;ve heard it argued that this was a good thing in the end/on net though on the basis that he was an incompetent commander.)

It&#039;s not wrong to e.g. kill someone in the process of defending someone, if the odds were not sufficiently in your favour that you could afford to go for a specifically nonlethal ending of the threat to an innocent/citizen. (whether such a level of circumstance is necessary for it to be not wrong to kill in defense of oneself or others, is another question, but I think the case I outline is unambigious and unontroversial, even if uncomfortable). If someone were to kill an attacker in such a circumstance, it would be a sign of good mental health for them not to be traumatized by it. 

Conversely, killing someone for personal convenience or gain is straightforwardly, basically definitionally, wrong -It&#039;s exchanging a relatively small gain for oneself, with a massive loss for another person, one that dwarfs the gain one gets. (there&#039;s also the negative societal externalities of murder for gain, which may be even more significant)


So I think the problem is with people who collapse the distinction between murder and killing so as to consider it all to be &quot;just-killing&quot;, i.e. &quot;not-murder killing&quot;, or justifiable, not-wrong killing.

But imo in that case this hitman character is not so much mentally unhealthy as philosophically or morally unhealthy. Their &quot;emotional balance&quot; may be very stable in whatever objective ways can be measured. They may be kind to their friends and their dog -they just think that killing people for personal gain is ok.]]></description>

I specifically left out rape because there&#039;s never a good reason to do it. I was hoping you would recgonise that it&#039;s in a different class than stealing and murder. (lol)Imo not recognising that would be a pretty bad sign if I wasn&#039;t fairly sure it was just a relatively minor case of frivolousness.

Stealing is easy, even an unambiguous case springs instantly to mind: Stealing from the nazis to aid the war effort. 

Murder has a definitional problem, yes. I meant scenarios in which the legal definition and the semantically-faithful meaning of &quot;wrong-killing&quot; might be in contradiction. I&#039;m not going to bother listing one for this as it could start a fight but I trust we all agree that there is in principle a distinction between law and morality. (And by &quot;we&quot;, I mean all people with whom I&#039;m willing to discuss moral philosophy by choice). However yes, that&#039;s less a question of scenarios and more a question of definitions and classification choices (like some people hold that doing a bad thing is never right, even if it is clearly the best thing in the circumstance, because it&#039;s still bad. I don&#039;t agree but I have never seen a logical refutation of that viewpoint).]]></description>

I only said that the argument was bad, not that empathy isn&#039;t Jesus. 

It just so happens that I think empathy is totally-not-jesus, but I didn&#039;t bring it up in that comment: The structure of the argument &quot;people at large do bad things to people with that quality&quot; is simply a bad argument for convincing rational people. Whether that quality in question is &quot;no empathy&quot;, &quot;highly empathetic&quot;, or &quot;serial killer&quot;, the argument is 100% equally as bad, because it&#039;s simply a misleading dressing up of an appeal to public opinion.]]></description>

<p>I only said that the argument was bad, not that empathy isn&#8217;t Jesus. </p>
<p>It just so happens that I think empathy is totally-not-jesus, but I didn&#8217;t bring it up in that comment: The structure of the argument &#8220;people at large do bad things to people with that quality&#8221; is simply a bad argument for convincing rational people. Whether that quality in question is &#8220;no empathy&#8221;, &#8220;highly empathetic&#8221;, or &#8220;serial killer&#8221;, the argument is 100% equally as bad, because it&#8217;s simply a misleading dressing up of an appeal to public opinion.</p>
