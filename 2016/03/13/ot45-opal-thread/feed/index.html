May I point out that corporations are just 1 form of private company? I&#039;m not 100% sure how much various personal enterprises and LLCs take up in the GDP, but it can&#039;t be &lt;i&gt;completely&lt;/i&gt; insignificant.]]></description>

I have a notion that part of what happened (possibly related to revulsion at the Holocaust) is that American Protestants decided to distinguish themselves from Catholics by being more pro-Jewish-- with Judaism being seen as more like early Christianity instead of having a bunch of Catholic stuff mixed in.

The other route (more common in Europe?) is for Protestants to distinguish themselves from Catholics by being more anti-Semitic. 

However, this is guesswork about the motivations of a lot of people from a somewhat different sub-culture, so I&#039;m not sure I&#039;m right.]]></description>

Yes, some people use every post as an open thread. But more than 10x as many people use link posts that way. Regardless of what Scott wants, which he has never said, they &lt;b&gt;function&lt;/b&gt; as open threads, hence my choice of words.

Fuck disclaimers and fuck you.]]></description>

No they don&#039;t. Link posts are supposed to be for discussing the links Scott posts. Some people use them as open threads, but some people use &lt;i&gt;every thread&lt;/i&gt; like an open thread.]]></description>

Underlining your point, at least one person referred to the above comment as &quot;sealioning&quot;, implying it now refers to any attempt by the Hated Enemy to defend themselves, anywhere. https://twitter.com/mathew/status/714107536463503360]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi all, I wonder if any of you have followed the current shitstorm on Moldbug and have insight. Please let me know if I&#039;m violating any ban, even though I&#039;m trying to be careful (I&#039;ve been lurking for a while).

Basically, a programming conference accepted a talk by Moldbug, and decided to keep having it even after he was alleged to be a racist and advocating slavery: http://degoes.net/articles/lambdaconf-inclusion
Most boycotted the conference, but some are worrying about the &quot;censorship&quot;, and sharing some of Scott&#039;s fears.

I already (mistakenly?) asked about this on Twitter (and tried to *not* get noticed and catching Scott in the shitstorm by avoiding links and hashtags). https://twitter.com/Blaisorblade/status/713148081185943554]]></description>

While the insult are fun and all, cheap Chinese labor is having the jobs &#039;stolen&#039; by even cheaper labor in the third world. So if you want to stiff the people of Ghana, now is your chance!]]></description>

@ Shieldfoss 
&lt;I&gt;The first is that I do not in fact believe that “a sizable fraction” would become pure lotuseaters worth nothing.&lt;/I&gt; 

Are there no studies we could look at, of people who already don&#039;t have to work for a living (or not many hours). Retirees on adequate pensions. Semi-retired business owners or people living on their investments. Even trust fund babies.]]></description>
