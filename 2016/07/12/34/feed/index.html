					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/07/12/34/#comment-383907&quot;&gt;Jill&lt;/a&gt;.

Jill, I think what you&#039;re describing is a lot of responsibility to put on a struggling client. Someone who hasn&#039;t been through therapy before probably doesn&#039;t know what progress in addressing their issue feels like, and would probably believe a therapist who says &quot;We made so much progress today!!,&quot; especially if they do feel a bit better leaving their office than when they arrived.

I went to several psychologists when I was a teenager, and at the time I certainly didn&#039;t see myself as an active participant in my own recovery. I had the impression that I should simply answer the questions they asked, take the specific actions they requested I take, and essentially wait for them to perform their mysterious acts of healing without my undue interference, in order to get better as soon as possible. That impression led me to waste a lot of time obediently answering questions about my mother and taking multiple-choice tests, while waiting desperately for some sort of magic intervention. 

If I&#039;d been told in the first place what the expectations from my side were, I would have interacted with these therapists very differently (and probably decided right away not to work with the first few). I don&#039;t see how I was to know that I needed to invest active effort into recovering, have my own goals for being in therapy, ask my own questions and hold a true two-way conversation, speak up when I doubted the therapist&#039;s recommendations, etc. At the time, the only background information I had was my school counselor&#039;s recommendation that I see a therapist for my issues.

Like yellow and green anonymous, I still hold some resentment toward the therapists I saw who didn&#039;t have the foresight/professionalism/experience to ask a new client what they wanted out of the relationship or encourage an adolescent to treat them as a collaborator rather than an authority figure. I realize now (especially after reading your comments) that I wasn&#039;t contributing adequately, but I feel strongly that these professional therapists should have guessed that I was unfamiliar with the process and given me guidance on how best to work with them.]]></description>

Mark Atwood, based on my experience, that&#039;s not the type of planning they mean when they ask if you&#039;re planning suicide. They&#039;re looking for concrete intent to act, e.g., &quot;I&#039;m going to take the whole bottle of ABC pills and then throw myself off the XYZ bridge tomorrow night at midnight.&quot; The intent, details, and schedule are all necessary components. Simply having ideas about how you might commit suicide if you wanted to does not merit committing you against your will. (Though it might result in additional questioning.)

Except for the fact that we&#039;re paying people a very large amount of money to do something that we could pay literally anyone to do with minimal training, instead of twelve years of higher education.

That would suggest that a great deal of the enterprise is ultimately a scam on some level.]]></description>

See I&#039;ve read exactly the opposite advice in the past (thanks reddit) and did the script exactly as Mark did,  which was how it had been recommended. I also had to repeat every step of the conversation. The rational for location first is that if that&#039;s all they get before your phone dies unexpectedly, they&#039;ll just send this your way which is a pretty good failure mode. This is just to make a meta comment on taking advice.

But I wonder if this example is more another instance of the thing where I ask someone how to spell a name but then am somehow totally unprepared for the answer when they rattle off letters. Maybe it doesn&#039;t really matter what the first sentence is, it just won&#039;t be fully processed since our brains aren&#039;t ready yet, apparently even for experienced  operators. Perhaps precisely because they expect the first sentence to be side track, as it is much of the time. Maybe that&#039;s why starting with your name works.]]></description>

@John Schilling

30K. Wow, the sad thing is I have a pretty solid idea of how simplistic many of the metrics are. And yes.  Pretty much everything is edited in some way. 

I wrote a set of tools for trying to do exactly this and the hard part isn&#039;t figuring out if an image has been edited in some way, unless you&#039;re dealing with someone who knows exactly how you&#039;re going to analyze it it&#039;s trivial, the hard part is spotting malicious editing. 

Pretty much everything has been lightened, darkened, rotated, cropped, re-saved at different quality levels etc etc etc. 

Most of these kinds of edits are &quot;allowed&quot;. 



My initial hope was to write my tools and then run the images from a few news sites through them. Unfortunately almost no images on public news sites are pure. 

The tools are however useful for newsrooms who are getting what are claimed to be raw/virgin images direct from the camera. Better again if they know the make and model of the camera or have a dataset of clean images from the same camera. 

I ended up with something which could generate a pretty decent report on an image and highlight areas of an image likely to have something odd going on. 

Still. 30K, fuck. I remember my brother telling me about when he discovered a product on the market roughly equivalent to his final year project wrapped in a slick interface for 250K. I think I now know how he felt.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Personally, all I wanted from life was to make a decent living by using old-school-yet-not-quite-analysis psychodynamic psychotherapy to help people, just like the characters in &lt;i&gt;Spellbound&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Dressed to Kill&lt;/i&gt;. But my dreams were dashed when it came to light that per science psychodynamic therapy is not necessarily an effective way to help people. I&#039;m also not sure I could get paid very much money to do that. Whether these facts are related, I don&#039;t know.

P.S. I continue to pay somebody else a serious amount of money to use psychodynamic therapy on me. I have advised myself that this kind of thing might be better suited to me than it is to most people, and even then I sometimes wonder. I enjoy it, at least.]]></description>

It sounds like you&#039;re making that up, Jill. What guarantees that the patient will know? What guarantees that even if they do know, they won&#039;t stop knowing if their therapist, -the expert, -who they have come to, perhaps in desperation- tells them otherwise? Perhaps with the great confidence with which some or all therapists are prone to speaking on subtle matters they understand little better, no better, or indeed worse than, anyone else.

It would certainly be convenient, if the laws of physics prevented such a thing happening, but unfortunately that sounds like bullshit.

Therapy is a fraught profession Jill. (perhaps not all the time but)

I had the impression from one of your comments that you had faced that.]]></description>
