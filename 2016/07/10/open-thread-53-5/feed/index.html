Actually, the plot of the 5th generation of Pokémon games, Pokémon Black and White, revolved around that game&#039;s version of Team Rocket, (each game has a different one) Team Plasma, being a PETA-like organization which objected to people capturing Pokémon and making them fight, and when around stealing Pokémon to &quot;liberate&quot; them.

(Of course, in the end its revealed that the leader of the team didn&#039;t actually believe his rhetoric, and was just stealing them so he would be the only one with Pokémon, and everyone eventually comes around to believe that the dynamic Dr. Dealgood is talking about below, where the training builds a bond of friendship between people and Pokémon which is better for both parties, is for the best.  Still, it was surprising to see a Pokémon game actually go there.)]]></description>

Oh sure, there&#039;s value in putting on the plays for the students. But the value is just for the students who have to put it on, unless they do a very good job (and dedicated high schoolers can; I was in a very good production of &lt;i&gt;Midsummer&#039;s&lt;/i&gt;). My point is just that watching a bad performance is as bad or worse than reading it.]]></description>

@Nicholas - &quot;For example: If the capability we are discussing is “a person reads a written message”&quot;

That&#039;s not the capability in question. The capability is getting your thoughts into another person&#039;s mind as rapidly as possible and regardless of distance. the platonic ideal would be instantaneous high-bandwidth telepathy of unlimited range, basically some sort of mind meld. Postal services, email and instant messenger are ways of approximating that ideal; we can easily rank them by how close they get to it.

&quot;Do we compare the crudeness of Ming Vases and Walmart plastic cups, and conclude that we have more primitive cups than the ancient Chinese?&quot;

red solo cups and ming vases are objects with entirely different purposes. Even a red solo cup compared to a drinking gourd is a bit off, because the solo cup is a hyperspecialized design while the drinking gourd is a generalized design. but even here, there&#039;s an obvious ranking: people who only have drinking gourd tech are less advanced than those who can make drinking gourds and ming vases, who are less advanced than those who can make drinking gourds, ming vases, and solo cups. utilitarian &#060; refined &#060; optimized. making a utlilitarian, general purpose object is easier than making a highly refined object for a specific purpose in tiny batches at fantastic expense, which is in turn less advanced than making a highly refined object in massive batches at minimal expense.

Ditto for roman roads; the point of a road is transportation. The ideal would be instantaneous teleportation with unlimited distance and payload. Our roads let us move more farther, faster, cheaper, ergo they are unquestionably more advanced.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Seeing a poor high school production is probably worse than reading.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ideally, the point of a high school production would be to get the student performers at least to actually study enough of the play to understand the words they are enunciating, etc, and so deliver some of that meaning to their fellow students in the audience.  That&#039;s probably the best possible way to build understanding of the material in that environment.  If instead you&#039;re just going to train a bunch of teenagers to recite without comprehension, why bother?  

Obviously that is going to happen anyway; I don&#039;t have a feel for how common it is.]]></description>

I think my experience the opposite. I always found the plays easier to understand when watching them rather than reading them. I&#039;m not necessarily able to understand every word while watching it, but seeing the context of the lines in action and hearing the actors&#039; inflections and body language can communicate enough to make up for not knowing exactly what they&#039;re saying all the time. I may not know exactly what this one character just said, but he&#039;s clearly really angry and the other guy and he&#039;s threatening him and that&#039;s exciting. If I really want to know exactly what was said I can look it up in a dictionary later.

Note this only really applies to good productions, where the actors have carefully studied the play are able to deliver all the lines with intention and meaning, and the staging enhances the action in the script. Seeing a poor high school production is probably worse than reading.]]></description>
