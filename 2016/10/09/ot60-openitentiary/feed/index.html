&quot;Wouldn’t all those explanations of why Jesus rising from the dead can’t be fake equally apply to all Muhammed’s miracles?&quot;

@ Glen:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Or the first teller of the tale made up that detail. To me, &lt;b&gt;the fact that nobody would have been in a position to overhear some conversation&lt;/b&gt; suggests artistic license was taken; to you it suggests somebody must have been been close enough to overhear. That kind of sums it up for me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You haven&#039;t actually shown this even *is* a fact. Ruling out counter-evidence on the grounds that it conflicts with your unproven theory is bad rationality.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dead bodies look very different from live bodies and dead tortured bodies look even MORE different.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Dead bodies look at least somewhat similar to live bodies, because people are able to identify whose they are. As for torture, Jesus had been scourged (which was generally done to the back), made to wear a crown of thorns (on the forehead) and crucified (nails through the wrists and ankles). His face would no doubt have been fairly bloodied from the thorns, but that would have been washed off when they were preparing the body for burial, and there’s no reason to think that his face would have been more notably disfigured than most other dead bodies’ are.

&lt;blockquote&gt;(a) is Right Out if our goal is to rank based on how likely some scenario was.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I’ve asked you before to justify why we should investigate the Crucifixion with an assumption that materialism is correct, and you pointedly refused to answer.  I don’t expect you’ll give an answer now, either. But, for the benefit of anybody reading this, I would like to point out that this *is* just an unargued-for assumption, that materialism has a variety of well-known intellectual difficulties, that &lt;a href=&quot;http://philpapers.org/surveys/results.pl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;at least a significant minority, and possibly a majority&lt;/a&gt;, of philosophers aren’t naturalists, and that assuming naturalism a priori is, therefore, no more than begging the question in favour of your case.


@ John:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Behold, nothing deserving death has been done by him; I will therefore chastise and release him”. Luke 23:15
Less explicitly, Mark 15:14, Matthew 27:23, and John 19:12. Per the only source material we have on any of this, the Romans rather clearly wanted Jesus to wander off and not bother them any more.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Pilate personally wasn’t convinced, but once he’d handed over Jesus to be executed, is there any reason to think that Jesus wouldn’t be treated like any other condemned traitor?]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Romans thought Jesus was a traitor and a leader of anti-Roman rebels. They wouldn’t just leave him around somewhere where he could wander off.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Synoptic Gospels all report Jesus’ conversation with the two thieves, so apparently someone was close enough to overhear that.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Or the first teller of the tale made up that detail. To me, the fact that nobody would have been in a position to overhear some conversation suggests artistic license was taken; to you it suggests somebody must have been been close enough to overhear. That kind of sums it up for me.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Plus, there’s the fact that after the crucifixion they took down Jesus’ body to bury it. You’d have thought that they might have realised it wasn’t him, either when taking the body away, or when washing it and preparing it for burial.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dead bodies look very different from live bodies and dead &lt;i&gt;tortured&lt;/i&gt; bodies look even MORE different. 

So depending on how similar they looked it&#039;s possible somebody &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; have spotted the error while preparing the body, but there&#039;s no reason to think it especially likely unless they had some prior reason to be &lt;i&gt;suspicious&lt;/i&gt; that it wasn&#039;t him.

And with that...I give up. You and I are playing a different game with different rules. I take it for granted that writers - even biblical ones - can be unreliable narrators. When I think about how magic tricks look different in memory than in the moment, much of the old testament seems to fit the mold pretty well.

If our choices are:
(a) &quot;miracles&quot; actually happened
(b) writers at some point in the chain between then and now &lt;i&gt;invented&lt;/i&gt; &quot;miracles&quot; out of whole cloth
(c) Witnesses of the time were &lt;i&gt;fooled into thinking&lt;/i&gt; they perceived miracles (and retroactively remembered details supporting it)

To me, (c) feels like a generously charitable interpretation that is surprisingly defensible. If we can&#039;t make (c) work, (b) is the fallback next-best option. (a) is Right Out if our goal is to rank based on how &lt;i&gt;likely&lt;/i&gt; some scenario was. 

If your preferred interpretation is that something happened which had never happened before in the entire history of humanity, you&#039;re...not really well-positioned to be claiming some alternate option &lt;i&gt;seems a little unlikely&lt;/i&gt;.]]></description>
