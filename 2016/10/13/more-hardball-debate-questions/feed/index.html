@ Titanium Dragon
&lt;i&gt;The problem with this is that there’s no evidence that police officers, in stressful situations, are any more likely to shoot black people; the only study I’m aware of on the subject matter suggested that police officers *aren’t* any more likely to shoot black people, all other things being equal.
&lt;/i&gt;
Scott did an article on this, concluding that shootings were about the same but other police violence with  blacks was more frequent.*  I don&#039;t recall whether escalation from the other violence into shooting situations was considered.

* at least in some areas]]></description>

I&#039;ve taken an IAT and it suggested that I thought Asians were nice but dumb (though not to a significant level), which is pretty much the opposite of the stereotype - and contrary to my own personal beliefs, at that.

Having looked at the literature on them, frankly, I&#039;m not impressed.]]></description>
