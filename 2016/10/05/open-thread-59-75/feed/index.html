@ David Friedman

CN - This is a mixture of my own reasons and my Typical Mind speculations about the reasons of other Democrats.
 
1) is most certain as it&#039;s based on fact, ie the record of Billary in the 90s.
2) many did, but I at least would have supported any Billary Surrogate, Gore preferred of course.
3) depending on what is meant by &#039;politician&#039;. When in a job, Hillary does a good job and polls well. Some people like to say she is bad at campaigning, but I like her methods: appearances with small groups to talk in depth about their particular concerns. And I like her positive appearance and manners; if nothing else, she&#039;s demonstrating emotional stamina, consistency, ability to raise the spirit of others and keep them on focus. She has done a good job of attracting the supporters needed for the primaries and for the general*. I followed 2008 closely, and there too she had a very near majority of the  primary votes.
4) dunno what people mean by a &#039;machine&#039;. Whatever it is, it didn&#039;t help her in 2008 (which really was rigged for Obama ;-).

&lt;i&gt;why Hilary has been the obvious Democratic candidate for so long–all the way back to 2008&lt;/i&gt;

In the 2008 primary she demonstrated her ability, stamina, etc.  My guess is that in 2016 no one serious in either party dared run against her; they knew she&#039;d win and he&#039;d get tagged as a loser.  Before 2008 I dunno; she had won well as NY Senator. Or maybe the 90s reputation had carried that far.

* In November 2008, exit polls showed she would have got more votes than Obama did. Nice when she wasn&#039;t on the ballot and her Hillary-Only supporters couldn&#039;t be exit polled because they had stayed home.]]></description>

I once calculated the amount of money I&#039;d get if I published my homebrew pen-and-paper RPG.  Using very generous sales figures, it was a survivable figure, but not a generous one.

The market is pretty thin - I think I calculated that there are at most around 3,000 brick-and-mortar stores in the US selling pen-and-paper-related supplies, which would be the primary non-Internet outlets; judging by the stores I&#039;ve visited, the average store services somewhere between 20-50 DMs, for a very very rough estimate of a market of at most 150,000 individuals across the country.

If you can consistently release annual updates to your material (new classes, dungeon guides, whatnot), you could probably survive on a solid fan base of around 3,000 DMs regularly buying your material, so you&#039;d need a market penetration rate of at least 2%, again assuming my relatively generous rough estimates.  That&#039;s achievable, but you&#039;d have to have nationwide distribution of your source material, and you&#039;d also need something substantive to offer that the existing systems are overlooking.

For a non-career single-shot release, I&#039;d hazard a guess that you could probably top out at around $50,000 after paying an artist, publishing, and distribution costs, assuming you did all the other work yourself - but the average release would probably barely break even.]]></description>

It&#039;s actually gotten surprisingly big.  As a data point, Gen Con gets 60,000 attendees a year, and a friend (who does make his living in the field) thinks that&#039;s mostly a matter of hitting the limits of the facilities, and that they could break 100,000 if they moved to a city with a larger convention center and more hotels.  The field has been a pretty major beneficiary of crowdfunding and internet-based publishing.

It&#039;s still not mostly a place to get rich.  (The standard advice for US-based RPG writers, as for most freelancers, is &quot;Marry someone with health insurance&quot;.)  But it does seem to be able to support a number of full-timers who are willing to live within what Robin Laws calls &quot;creative class&quot; incomes.]]></description>

Sure, but it informs his tenure in the Senate.

Compare him to John Edwards, who also is running for the Democratic nomination during his first term in the Senate, but had no political service beforehand, and comes in a far distant second to John Kerry (and is subsequently named to the Kerry ticket).

Edwards came off as slick and calculating in a way that Obama never really did. Of course, that might be because Edwards is slick and calculating ... but, it&#039;s still a data point in an otherwise small set.]]></description>

@gbdub:

He is alleged by accusers to have done worse. Worse than than what Trump said that he did.

But the allegations against Trump are worse than the allegations against Clinton (and haven&#039;t been nearly as thoroughly investigated). Trump was not particularly tarred by allegations that he violently raped his first wife, tearing out her hair in the process. Nor the allegations that he raped a minor.

Self-described conduct, especially on tape, is given more weight than allegations (especially old allegations that have been investigated) when assessing political candidates, especially in a highly polarized atmosphere.]]></description>

Side? What about the third side: &lt;b&gt;actual liberals&lt;/b&gt; (according to the root of understanding of that term).

One of my major criticisms of the intersectionalist movement is its abandoning of liberal norms of coexistence in favor of might makes right. The same criticism can and has been laid upon the conservative moral busybodies who have been resisting liberalism since forever. Back when it was only conservatives doing it I considered myself on the left. The thing that makes social justice AKA intersectional-feminism so shocking is that it represents the breaking of antiliberalism into the mainstream &lt;i&gt;from the left&lt;/i&gt;. 

Previously, illiberal manifestations of left wing thought have been locked away in academia (or in fringe Marxist parties that have no hope in hell) - or so we thought - but through pop feminism they&#039;ve found a route into mainstream discourse, such that major world leaders like Justin Trudeau will now rage against &quot;Ants&quot; and &quot;misogyny in popular media&quot;. A left-LIBERAL wouldn&#039;t draw political attention to such things, and indeed, until we passed through the magical time portal known as 2012, they didn&#039;t. Then it all started happening at once, and instead of resisting it on the grounds that it wasn&#039;t an expansion of liberal ideology at all, the overwhelming reaction has been &quot;Oh so, this is the new liberalism 3.0 upgrade! Don&#039;t wanna be left behind and called evil!&quot; and now mainstream left wing politicians are using terms like &quot;mansplaining&quot; and worrying about misogyny in gaming, and on forums I go to, posters who made dirty jokes three years ago are now policing everyone else on &quot;objectification&quot; with no sense of self-awareness.

EDIT: 

My social norms are liberalism circa the year 2000, not &quot;conservatism&quot;.

I&#039;m very annoyed with those on the right who have turned the term &quot;SJW&quot;, which described an new &lt;i&gt;illiberal&lt;/i&gt; manifestation of left wing ideology into a snarl word encompassing actual liberal positions like civil rights, universal suffrage, and gay marriage and so on.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think the modern change that has happened is in the tactics: the personal is political; all spaces must be open; “He can either stand with us or with the child pornographers” (Vic Towes). The social justice crowd wants to stigmatize neutrality and neutral spaces, and via the internet they can bring disproportionate force to bear.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I think it&#039;s worth pointing out that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/with-us-or-with-the-child-pornographers-doesnt-cut-it-mr-toews/article547530/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the Vic Toews quote was given as the Public Safety Minister for the Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;, which is not normally accused of being full of social justice warriors. Neither side has a monopoly on this tactic.]]></description>
