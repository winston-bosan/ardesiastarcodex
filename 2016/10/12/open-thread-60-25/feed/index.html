@bean

&lt;blockquote&gt;    So now you are arguing that the Mars rovers did not show a steady progression in automation, machine vision, decisioning and tele-operation capabilities throughout the last several decades?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bean:&lt;i&gt;I’m arguing that Mars rover operation is of only marginal relevance to industrial work. Driving slowly across Mars and scooping up the occasional rock is a far cry from what we’ll need to do serious resource exploitation. How would any of these things have helped the Intelsat rescue?
&lt;/i&gt;

Now you are moving the goalposts around a lot. The original point you/h were making was how awesome it was that humans could catch a satellite that a special robot arm in 1992 couldn&#039;t. I said tele-operation, remotes, etc. have progressed a lot since 1992 (implying that the future is not limited to 1992 technology). You said no progress was made at all in tele-operation, and I brought up the Mars rovers as a space-relevant example. The specific tasks of the those rovers may not be the exact same as large scale space mining, but their rapid evolution in capabilities shows that our computers and our software are getting much better and machine vision is actually a real thing now (and will be getting better).  All of that is very relevant to a wide variety of tasks beyond specimen collection.

I think today having a robot do the Intelsat repair would still be more expensive than a free space shuttle ride (if you are going to discount all the actual costs of transporting and safely returning waterbags). But junking it would be the cheapest solution, and satellites and industrial processes (six sigma, etc.) are much better now than they were in 1992 so blunders like Hubble and Intelsat IV which are amenable to manual repair will be even more rare in the future. Designing complex systems for easier LRU replacement can also be done if you do anticipate that need (certainly for all routine maintenance like battery swap outs, etc. that should be expected in long-term designs). Obviously satellites are not currently designed that way. If there were any routinely necessary maintenance functions they would be designed for automated drone services. And if they were rare types of failures, then the mass of the replacement will almost always be a better expense than the mass of a waterbag Maytag repairman and maintaining the infrastructure around him.]]></description>

@Lumifer:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Oh, that’s just to match the space mining industry.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The example of saturation divers is relevant here.  These people have to spend their off-hours in pressurized habitats so they don&#039;t get the bends.  Replacing them with robots would be a major benefit, and wouldn&#039;t even have the recursion problem I brought up, because we could just haul them up and fix them on the surface.  For that matter, replacing EVAs with robots would be tremendously helpful, simply because EVAs are a major pain.  Again, no recursion problem because you haul the robot into the airlock and fix it there.  And yet they don&#039;t exist, and I&#039;m not aware of any serious research on them.]]></description>

Maintenance robots have the conspicuous disadvantage of not existing.

Instead, we get great enthusiasm about the prospects for teleoperated systems capable of performing only the simplest maintenance tasks.

For the rest, there&#039;s humans or there&#039;s abandoning everything as soon as it breaks in a not-simple way.  Or there&#039;s waiting for the true -general-purpose AI, because that&#039;s what a general-purpose maintenance robot will require.

Granted it may be a minority view here in the LW diaspora, but some of us aren&#039;t planning to wait for AI to make all our dreams and/or nightmares come true.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Know what? Thirty years ago it made sense to have a set of tools and some spares in your car on long road trips. This was because cars were simple and could actually be fixed on the spot by a shade-tree mechanic for a large class of breakdowns. But that time has passed. Nowadays it’s much less useful to have a set of tools in your trunk since a modern car is mostly a collection of computers which control and manage some mechanical machinery and they are just not fixable on the spot.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
All of this is true.  But we&#039;re talking about doing industry here, which inherently involves doing things with physical objects that aren&#039;t standardized.  Your average person can&#039;t fix a printer if it really breaks, but he can clear a paper jam just fine.  Now, think about building a printer which doesn&#039;t jam, or which can clear its own jams.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Your examples all go back to that 60s technology which in a large number of cases could be repaired with a crowbar, some wrenches, and duct tape. But its time is also passing. The number of mechanical moving parts goes down, the number of solid-state components goes up.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For mining and factories?  Hardly.  Again, industry, not just exploration.  And half of the time, the &#039;fix&#039; in question is something that doesn&#039;t even rise to the level of being considered a fix, because of how simple it is.  The lawnmower&#039;s outlet got clogged with grass.  The toilet is running because the chain got tangled and isn&#039;t letting the valve close.  The door is sticky and needs to be slammed to latch.  Designing systems for absolutely no maintenance is a lot harder than designing systems which are very minimally maintained.]]></description>
