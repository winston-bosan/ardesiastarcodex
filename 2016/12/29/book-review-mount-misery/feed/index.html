Linvega above is talking about psychiatry, but nearly everything there is very applicable to AA, particularly in refusing to notice that the &quot;patient&quot; is getting worse, attributing every success to the program, and presenting every failure of the program as personal moral failing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path. Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program, usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves. There are such unfortunates. They are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way. They are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner of living which demands rigorous honesty. Their chances are less than average. &quot;

That is read out at the start of every AA and NA meeting.  At the start of the hour - so probably five minutes ago or so - tens of thousands of vulnerable, suffering addicts are treated to that message, and what a perfect encapsulation of their attitude.  First, there is the blatant disregard for anything like facts - this claim is empirically testable, has been tested, and found hilariously incorrect.  AA is not a panacea, according to Scott&#039;s own research, it gets maybe a few percentage points above control, if that.  There are millions and millions of people who fail, following their path.  Why is an organization that is supposedly based upon truth, on elevating us to a more honest state of being, starting every single meeting off with a lie?

If that were the only thing they&#039;d be like any other snake oil salesman, probably getting in the way of legitimate treatment but likely harmless.   The cult is not content with that, of course.  They not only need to inflate their own efficacy beyond any reasonable level, they insist on denigrating the character of those for whom it does not work.  And I simply cannot believe that you can think this is anything like responsible medical practice, Scott.  What would happen to you if you told a patient that they were &quot;constitutionally incapable of honesty&quot; if a certain medication or therapeutic technique didn&#039;t work?  AA is in a position of power over its members, sometimes in a literal legal sense, but always in a psychological sense.  

It&#039;s difficult to overstate this - if you&#039;re going to your first AA meeting, you&#039;ve probably hit rock bottom, or been forced to by a court or family member that is willing to threaten anything to get you there.  AA, by its own design and the indoctrination of its users, is seen as the only source of truth.  If you question it in the slightest, you are accused - first by AA itself, then be the people you love - of being a dry drunk, not committed to recovery, a bad person because you&#039;re still trying to find an excuse to drink.  It&#039;s quite similar to the description of psychiatry (and Staliism) above.  It&#039;s never considered that you might be angry with them because they&#039;re telling you what a piece of shit you are and instilling foreign values in you.  It&#039;s always the disease talking.

They have power over people when they are at their lowest and most fragile, when self-loathing is running rampant, and questions about whether they&#039;re even capable of being a good person.  To tell that audience that failure to get better with a cure that barely works better than chance is proof that they are fundamentally dishonest, broken people goes beyond mere professional irresponsibility.  It&#039;s abusive.  AA isn&#039;t a cult, of course.  It&#039;s just as abusive as one.

Writing the smallest good thing about the organization, and thus encouraging more of society&#039;s most vulnerable to submit to the psychological abuse of the self-loathing, is irresponsible.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Scott, you write: &quot;Sometimes the imagery clicked; other times, it just seemed like caricatures.&quot; 

Perhaps it&#039;s just that people in the (at least decades distant) past actually were in fact as bafflingly stupid and crude caricatures it seems they must have been? Because, you know, everyone, through all the increasingly exponentially complex connections between people, their phones, their pets, suggesting a book, seeing this or that situation in terms of Lacanian theory about mirrors or whatever, every single interaction and causal happening of this because of that, and all that, interacting in all sorts of exponentially complex ways, has in fact made it so that what they had to struggle to see is now completely obvious to us?

So what clicks is the essential insights they had, and what&#039;s crude caricature stuff is, well, because, people actually were crude caricatures back in the day, because they hadn&#039;t learned to see all that&#039;s, thanks to their efforts, completely obvious to us.]]></description>

Let H be the hypothesis &quot;narcissism is an evolution of society&quot;.

Assume H is true.

Then this &quot;narcissism&quot; is worth studying for precisely the same reason we yell about problems with today&#039;s glaciers.  If we understand the forces driving the change, and especially if those forces are the result of individual choices on a massive scale, we can do something to alter incentives and arrest---maybe even reverse---the change.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yo, if you wrote a review of TLP&#039;s posts on narcissism ... well I would read it and share it all around.  I feel like I&#039;ve got a good personal handle on the concept, but I could easily be mistaken.  

As an offering of the one post that spoke to me more than any other: http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2012/10/the_story_of_narcissus.html

Specifically, the paragraphs at the end where TLP describes hypothetical bad parenting.

&lt;blockquote&gt;No one knows what Liriope and Cephisus did, but whatever they did, it worked: he didn&#039;t even recognize his own reflection.  That&#039;s a man who doesn&#039;t know himself. That&#039;s a man who never had to look at himself from the outside.

How do you make a child know himself?  You surround him with mirrors. &quot;This is what everyone else sees when you do what you do.  This is who everyone thinks you are.&quot;

You cause him to be tested: this is the kind of person you are, you are good at this but not that. This other person is better than you at this, but not better than you at that.  These are the limits by which you are defined.   Narcissus was never allowed to meet real danger, glory, struggle, honor, success, failure; only artificial versions manipulated by his parents.   He was never allowed to ask, &quot;am I a coward?  Am I a fool?&quot;  To ensure his boring longevity his parents wouldn&#039;t have wanted a definite answer in either direction.  

He was allowed to live in a world of speculation, of fantasy, of &quot;someday&quot; and &quot;what if&quot;.   He never had to hear &quot;too bad&quot;, &quot;too little&quot; and &quot;too late.&quot;  

When you want a child to become something-- you first teach him how to master his impulses, how to live with frustration.  But when a temptation arose Narcissus&#039;s parents either let him have it or hid it from him so he wouldn&#039;t be tempted, so they wouldn&#039;t have to tell him no.  They didn&#039;t teach him how to resist temptation, how to deal with lack.  And they most certainly didn&#039;t teach him how NOT to want what he couldn&#039;t have.  They didn&#039;t teach him &lt;i&gt;how to want&lt;/i&gt;.   

The result was that he stopped having desires and instead desired the feeling of desire.&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>
