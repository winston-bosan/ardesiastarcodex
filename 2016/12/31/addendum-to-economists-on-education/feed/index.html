					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/12/31/addendum-to-economists-on-education/#comment-449009&quot;&gt;Scott Alexander&lt;/a&gt;.

I will take this, with the following adjustments/caveats:

The money is paid not to the participants, but a charity selected by yourself (Malaria nets and MIRI are both acceptable to me, but I doubt I&#039;d be against any charity you select).

This is so that bias towards you/people who have read this and know the answer is somewhat counteracted by bias towards getting more money donated to charity.

It would still probably be best to use a Twitter other than your own.

As for the logistics, I&#039;m comfortable sending you $10 by paypal/google wallet. Upon the outcome of the bet, if you win, you send $10 to the charity. I am out $10, you are out $0, and some amount of life is saved.

If I win, you send me back $10, and send $100 to the charity.

NB: I don&#039;t actually disagree with your assessment, but I don&#039;t mind spending $10 that will go to charity to find out more conclusively.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What about the opposite bet: show them your summary of the data from the first article (“About twice as many economists believe a voucher system would improve education as believe that it wouldn’t.”) and ask them if, from that statement, the &lt;i&gt;majority &lt;/i&gt;of economists believe that a voucher system would improve education.

I don&#039;t think you&#039;d take that bet against me, and I think you know full-well why - you&#039;d lose.

What makes you think you are being any more honest than the times? The way you are setting this up, you are claiming to be empirically-minded, but you are deliberately setting up a bet that you will win.

But that bet is a strawman, because we all know how people parse data. You&#039;re being righteously indignant, but you&#039;re still not being honest about it with yourself.

The headline - that most economists don&#039;t buy school vouchers - is correct. Most don&#039;t buy it. They don&#039;t feel that the evidence is strong enough to convince them. And given the bias in economic thought towards such systems, this should immediately give you pause when you suggest that the most accurate way to parse the data is that twice as many support it as oppose it, because you&#039;re excluding the largest group.

If an idea is not well-accepted enough that a majority of people in the field accept it, that&#039;s not something I would ever present in a particularly &lt;i&gt;positive&lt;/i&gt; light in terms of widespread belief.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott,

I like the survey you propose in your 12/31 7:10pm comment. It reminds me of &quot;experimental philosophy,&quot; where you use survey methods to probe people&#039;s intuitive judgments about cases. I do a little Xphi myself, so I ran your survey exactly as you worded it.

I did it on MTurk, and solicited 40 responses.

I used the first question as a comprehension check, retaining 35 subjects who correctly answered “a.” 

On the key question:

&lt;blockquote&gt;2. According to this article:
a) Most economists support privatizing education
b) Most economists oppose privatizing education
c) Unsure / the article doesn’t say&lt;/blockquote&gt;

32 of the 35 answered (b), 2 answered (a), and 1 answered (c).

In short, the data has spoken and it is clear that Dynarski’s text is quite misleading. This is pretty sloppy journalism and the NYT ought to correct the record.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That fifth point, about specifying &quot;most&quot; students and getting vastly different results, is incredibly damning. The economists surveyed raised a concern about the survey design, it was addressed in a followup, and the results changed substantially in the face of a better-worded question. Which is to say, the initial data is pretty dubious and the followup data should be given far more weight.

That this was not emphasized, or even &lt;i&gt;mentioned&lt;/i&gt;, ought to be a powerful indictment of the article. At best, someone grabbed the first data at hand without looking for newer or better sources. At worst, someone dropped the followup for not conforming to narrative.

Either way, it convinces me that this is not just an ambiguous headline but a serious error of journalism.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While I agree that it was not the most accurate way to frame the study. I find the harsh criticism of this piece kind of baffling for two reasons.

First, many of the people criticizing it treat it like a front page news story when it should rather be read as a nyt sponsored blog post. Rightly or wrongly this type of content, like newspaper opinion pieces, is a &#039;take&#039; on a issue of public concern. Her take is that economics (both the practitioners and the discipline) show that &quot;Unswerving adherence to free, private markets will not solve the problems faced by our education system.&quot; This take is framed in the context of Trump&#039;s pick for Sec. of Ed., who is gung ho for privatization/vouchers (which, it should be noted, the author praises in piece). In &#039;takes&#039; like this one it is, in my opinion, common practice to read and cite evidence in such a way that is bolsters the point being made. And, it is perfectly acceptable to point out that the evidence could be interpreted a different way, and that this second way is better for xyz reasons, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s fair to call the author dishonest, or to call it really poor journalistic practice.  In sum, criticism is certainly warranted, but Scott&#039;s post presented this as the NYT misreporting a study to promote an ideological view, and I think the framing is very different if it is looked at as a blog presenting a slightly biased view of a study.

Second, THIS ISSUE IS NOT IN ANY WAY CENTRAL TO HER POST! (sorry for yelling)  She used the report as a counterpoint to economists views on Uber (90% thought it made consumers better off).  It reads almost as well if you substitute in 45% for 33%, because it is compared to the previous 90% on the Uber question, and used to support the notion that economists are &quot;less optimistic about unfettered markets in education.&quot;  This point is being made by the author because she says that &quot;you might expect economists to support DeVos&#039;&quot; radical privatization.  It&#039;s worth noting that the next time she talks about vouchers she praises them for the impressive results they achieved in Mass., but notes that you need government oversight of the schools to ensure quality, which DeVos opposed. She also discusses college loans by private banks and why moving in that direction is such a bad idea. 

All in all, it just seems like a massive kerfuffle over a small issue]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As Scott points out (but with less emphasis than I think it deserves), Ms. Dynarski&#039;s claim is directly contradicted by her source. 

IGM poll results:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If public school students had the option of taking the government money (local, state, federal) currently being spent on their own education and turning that money into vouchers that they could use towards covering the costs of any private school or public school of their choice (e.g. charter schools), &lt;b&gt;most would be better off&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt; [emphasis added]

Responses:
&lt;b&gt;Agree or Strongly Agree
44%&lt;/b&gt;
Uncertain
34%
Disagree or Strongly Disagree
5%
No Opinion or Did Not Answer
15%

Claim by Ms. Dynarski:

&quot;Only &lt;b&gt;a third&lt;/b&gt; of economists on the Chicago panel agreed that students &lt;i&gt;would be better off&lt;/i&gt; if they all had access to vouchers to use at any private (or public) school of their choice.&quot;  [emphasis added]

To support her claim, Ms. Dynarski links to the IGM poll, but to a different question, wherein only 36% (i.e. roughly &quot;a third&quot;) of the respondents agreed that &quot;students would receive a &lt;b&gt;higher quality of education&lt;/b&gt;&quot; with vouchers. [emphasis added]

Ms. Dynarksi&#039;s choice to use economists&#039; opinions about the effect of vouchers on the &quot;quality of education&quot; as a proxy for their opinions on the effect of vouchers on &lt;b&gt;student welfare&lt;/b&gt;, particularly when the same source provides a direct measure of those same economists&#039; views on the voucher / welfare question, is misleading.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wonder why it matters so much whether economists prefer school vouchers.  What about educators?  Or eligible voters?  Or maybe it doesn&#039;t matter so much who prefers them, but whether student performance is better--  or something else significant is better, on average, in areas that have school vouchers?  And how much it costs to have them vs. to continue the current school system.  If it&#039;s more expensive and has no performance results to show for itself, maybe it does not matter so much who prefers them.  Because, given that information, all people who prefer not to pay extra taxes for nothing, would then be against them. 

Also, I wonder, if you asked economists what their political orientation was, would that predict their preference for school vouchers or lack thereof?  If so, you may be just measuring the political orientation of the economists surveyed, on average.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would like to just quickly point out that not responding affirmatively to the question posed in the article&#039;s quoted survey is not the same as supporting school vouchers.

If I were posed that question I would probably answer uncertain. Students may get a better education or an equivalent one. There&#039;s a small possibility that they would get a marginally worse one.

However I strongly support school vouchers (at least compared to the current system) because I think they could deliver that roughly equivalent education at a much lower cost.

So even if we get past the way the article reported the statistics, I think the choice of reporting responses to that particular question as reflecting economist&#039;s opinions on school vouchers overall is pretty darn misleading (though possibly unintentionally so).]]></description>
