The problem is that his summary is utter bullshit and gives a more misleading impression than the article itself does. The headline suggests that most economists don&#039;t buy school vouchers. The data... says the same thing (less than 40% do).

Compared to 90% for Uber, that suggests a huge difference. It would be equally accurate to say &quot;only about a third as many economists support school vouchers as support Uber&quot;. It would give a better impression of the data than his statement.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/12/30/contra-nyt-on-economists-on-education/#comment-448928&quot;&gt;DavidFriedman&lt;/a&gt;.

Beyond inelasticity of demand, another issue is whether or not, by exporting low-wage jobs, you can basically force people into higher-paying jobs that wouldn&#039;t have existed otherwise.

While economics: red in tooth and claw is popular, in reality, a lot of businesses (especially smaller ones) will avoid risks if they&#039;re making reasonable profits. If you make it so that an old economic model is no longer viable, suddenly the risk of staying the way you were before is &quot;you go out of business&quot;, so you&#039;re incentivized to take risks. This is even more true of employees.

If your people are not taking enough risks, pushing people to take risks may be better for your economy. Of course, all of this is predicated on people not just giving up, so you&#039;d probably want to combine your program with propaganda that the economy is doing well, so it is a good time to make a new business/expand it to encourage people to take that risk.

Moreover, if the result is increased automation at the lower end of things, we&#039;re not really losing anything; the net work done is the same, but we now have a few more jobs for people building WalMart stocking robots, which increases the total production of the economy; even if you have more people out of work, you&#039;re not any poorer as a society (and may actually be richer, if the real barrier was high capital costs on the robots which are now overcome by requiring higher wages).

After all, if you have the choice between paying a bunch of money up front for automation vs paying people low wages, if you raise the wages, you push people in favor of automation. High capital costs relative to low labor costs can push you in the direction of employing people over machines; the higher labor costs get, the more incentive there is to automate and the lower the relative annoyance of paying a bunch of money up front for better capital goods to automate gets.

Another issue is whether or not growth is being constrained by lack of quality free workers; if a certain fraction of unemployed people are fundamentally unemployable (i.e. no one wants them because they&#039;re lazy/don&#039;t show up on time/can&#039;t get along with people/ect and thus end up in constant job churn), generating additional unemployed people who [i]are[/i] employable may be beneficial to your economy. You might be encouraged to do projects you aren&#039;t going to do otherwise because, hey, you&#039;ve got people you can hire who will do them who will actually do their jobs. This is especially true for potentially otherwise undesirable work that people might otherwise be &quot;too good for&quot;, but when the alternative is not having a job (as opposed to having a lower-paying job) they might be willing to take it (after all, higher pay - unpleasantness might not be better than a low wage, but it is probably better than nothing).

I&#039;m not necessarily arguing that all of this is true, mind you, but all of these are potentially real reactions. Obviously raising minimum wage by too much is going to cause problems. However, on the other hand, Australia has a $13 USD/hour minimum wage but their unemployment rate is only 5.6% last I checked - higher than ours, to be sure, but much lower than many countries and indeed, comparable to much of the South.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think that the headline is the best way to present the information to laypeople, TBH.

Saying &quot;about twice as many economists believe a voucher system would improve education as believe that it wouldn&#039;t&quot; is deeply misleading - a lot of people would assume a 66/33 split. Instead, we see a 36/37/19 split.

The &lt;i&gt;most &lt;/i&gt;accurate way of representing the graph would be &quot;economists uncertain that school vouchers would improve education.&quot; Which is quite correct - the plurality of economists are uncertain whether or not school vouchers would improve education, and the rest are divided.

I don&#039;t think that the headline is actually wrong at all - it is absolutely correct. Only a third of economists &quot;buy it&quot; - two-thirds don&#039;t. Most people would get the correct impression from the headline, but they wouldn&#039;t really understand the subtleties.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Obvious point: why do we care what economists believe?

The real question is what the evidence points us towards, not what people believe. We should be looking at actual arguments and data and evidence, not people shouting about shit.

I mean, let&#039;s face it - do most of these economists have a [i]well-informed[/i] opinion on this? I severely doubt it. Most of them probably spend their time studying other things.

The people who are almost certainly most correct are the people in the [i]uncertain[/i] category, because they&#039;re most likely to be the best calibrated and be able to explain why they are uncertain. They&#039;re probably more likely to be able to explain the potential pros and cons than anyone else.

I&#039;m pretty profoundly skeptical of school vouchers because I don&#039;t think that education operates much like an open market, I don&#039;t see good evidence of private schools actually being better, I don&#039;t think parents are mostly capable of making informed decisions about which schools are good or bad, I think a lot of parents don&#039;t really have the informed best interests of their children in mind, and I think the tribally unifying effects of public education are important.

All of those are big problems and only one of them is properly &quot;economics&quot;.]]></description>

I &lt;a href=&quot;http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=2653#comment-280934&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;remember this&lt;/a&gt; from the Obamacare debate. Well, the first Obamacare debate.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2010/images/03/22/rel5a.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here&#039;s the CNN poll&lt;/a&gt;. Opinion broke down to 43% believing it was too liberal, 39% just right, 13% not liberal enough. This was reported as &lt;a href=&quot;http://dailysignal.com/2010/03/22/new-cnn-poll-59-oppose-obamacare/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;New CNN Poll: 59% Oppose Obamacare&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. You could just as easily say that 52% believed that we should have Obamacare &lt;i&gt;or something stronger&lt;/i&gt;. I remember seeing this poll &lt;i&gt;everywhere&lt;/i&gt; that year.

(Also, the comments there--&quot;Our senators and congressmen have commited treason against our country and its people. Come November they must be voted out of office. They are on the same level as Hitler, using the same tactics he did.&quot;--add a little perspective to the recent complaints that the left is too easily riled up, and this is why the right is ascendant.)]]></description>

@TheWackademic &lt;blockquote&gt;A poll asking “Does random stranger deserve to live?” will not result in 99.9% uncertain&lt;/blockquote&gt; You may be a random stranger now, but as soon as Scott asks the question you join the set of people who have been the subject of &quot;Does X deserve to live?&quot; in a poll.

My nitpicky objection to the hypothetical is that people who don&#039;t support the death penalty and utilitarians who don&#039;t think in terms of what people &#039;deserve&#039; may answer &#039;no&#039; with certainty even if it&#039;s not unlikely that you&#039;re asking about a nasty character.
