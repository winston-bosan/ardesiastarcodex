What about the link between the Right, ignoring experts, and conspiracy theorisation?

@Well...

&lt;blockquote&gt;Worst case scenario my wife goes grocery shopping with gloves and a facemask on, while I lie on the couch and supervise my kids’ hour of TV.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

FYI, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/someone-in-your-house-has-coronavirus-now-what&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that if anyone in your house has tested positive, everyone in the house should self-quarantine for a minimum of 14 days or longer until the patient has no more symptoms and tests negative.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and

&lt;blockquote&gt;The CDC recommends that infected family members stay in one room away from others as much as possible and use a separate bathroom if available. Visitors should also be kept away from the house.

The door to the sick person’s room should be kept closed and only one family member should attend to that person, according to CDC guidelines.

The person caring for a sick relative should also leave food outside of their room and when the caregiver enters the room both people should wear facemasks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

There is work on very cheap tests for this happening (That is, a dollar per test) at which point the next move is to manufacture those by the billion and test everyone daily, quarantining the positive cases until the virus is extinct.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe it’s necessary but not sufficient. So I don’t need to address your footprint example (I agree the presence of some causal chain alone is not sufficient) but ought to address the question of hobbits.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#039;d be interest to hear what you think needs to be added to make it sufficient. I&#039;m having trouble thinking of any possible extra ingredient which doesn&#039;t somehow smuggle in intentionality from elsewhere, but that might just be a lack of imagination on my part.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, how do imaginary things come about in our imaginations? I’m inclined to agree with Kirby Ferguson that everything is a remix. We imagine things by combining both concepts from the real world, and the fictional constructions of others, in new and interesting ways. I’d say hobbits in particular combine the idea of a “relative” race of Man (perhaps inspired by the notion of subspecies of animals) with the concepts of being very short, walking barefoot, living in holes, and being hospitable. All of these individual ideas clearly have links to the real world; Tolkien simply combined them into a composite and called them Hobbits.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I agree with all this, but I&#039;m not sure it helps you to refute &quot;(1) configurations of matter cannot by themselves be about anything&quot;. If the LOTR-shaped configuration of matter currently sitting on my shelf is &quot;by itself&quot; about hobbits, then it should be possible to explain its aboutness without having recourse to any third object, like JRR Tolkien or his mental activities. Nobody doubts that configurations of matter can be about something, just that they can be about something without getting that aboutness from some external source.]]></description>

I believe it&#039;s necessary but not sufficient. So I don&#039;t need to address your footprint example (I agree the presence of some causal chain alone is not sufficient) but ought to address the question of hobbits.

As you say, hobbits do not exist in reality; they are a fictional construction from the imagination of one J.R.R. Tolkien. So how can there possibly be a causal chain to anything meaningful?

Well, how do imaginary things come about in our imaginations? I&#039;m inclined to agree with Kirby Ferguson that &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/zd-dqUuvLk4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;everything is a remix.&lt;/a&gt; We imagine things by combining both concepts from the real world, and the fictional constructions of others, in new and interesting ways. I&#039;d say hobbits in particular combine the idea of a &quot;relative&quot; race of Man (perhaps inspired by the notion of subspecies of animals) with the concepts of being very short, walking barefoot, living in holes, and being hospitable. All of these individual ideas clearly have links to the real world; Tolkien simply combined them into a composite and called them Hobbits.

So anyone who speaks of Hobbits today must have some causal connection to Tolkien&#039;s imagination, and Tolkien had connections to the real world (or to other stories whose attributes in turn link somehow to reality) for each of the attributes of the halflings he imagined. If this wasn&#039;t the case, how could he have written sensibly about them in a way that millions of readers understand?

I think a similar process is going on when I imagine, say, a &quot;regular 23-gon.&quot; I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;ve never seen one, but I can conceptualize it by combining the concepts of &quot;regular polygon&quot; and &quot;23&quot;. (Also possibly &quot;circle&quot;, since that&#039;s what higher-order regular polygons start to look like.)]]></description>

Yeah, my point is that I highly doubt this is feasible in the long-term, and it won&#039;t be solved in the short-term, so it seems we should be using this time to make more practicable preparations for ongoing management. Some people are doing that, but it&#039;s not the main message. Like Scott, I&#039;m wondering about the curious lack of mobilization and silence on certain things. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;We would want to do that region by region, I’m guessing.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I think it will naturally become a region-specific thing, as that is the nature of this. So we won&#039;t have to do this all at once, which makes ongoing management more feasible. But, obviously, you won&#039;t be able to contain it totally without imposing draconian domestic measures that I do not think are feasible or worthwhile. I expect national borders to stay more or less closed until we get a better handle on what is going on, which I think is much more doable. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I’m at a loss for how to coordinate this. Do we want bidding wars between regions for tests?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Personally, I don&#039;t think this can be coordinated at the level of effectiveness people seem to be hoping for. I don&#039;t really get all the hope pinned on the testing---are we going to build a little colony for people who are clear to release them into? How long after infection does it take for them to test positive? We know this has a long incubation period, and there&#039;s no safe area. If one infected person gets in to a designated safe area, you have to start from scratch. It just won&#039;t be possible to draw a meaningful line unless you are significantly segregating people away from their families, etc.]]></description>

As a bid, it would have no connection with the card, but for completeness since a 6 bid is a small slam it might be bid by someone who thinks they can make a small slam in diamonds, or could be a conventional response to some conventional bid seeking information on whether and where to proceed to grand slam. But as for the meaning of the card, the only way to make sense of that is as a question about what it means to lead such a card. If it&#039;s the opening lead, it probably indicates that partner should lead diamonds if partner gets the lead, though it might mean that opener has reason to believe based on the bidding that partner may be able to do something if diamonds are led. As an opening lead at no trump, it may indicate that diamonds are opener&#039;s best suit and the 6 is opener&#039;s 4th highest diamond. In pretty much all of these cases, there is an implication that the opener&#039;s partner should play their highest diamond, unless that would be lower than whatever declarer has played from dummy. Also, for clarity, these are the implications of playing a low/mediocre diamond, not of playing the 6 specifically (no version of bridge I&#039;m familiar with assigns coded meanings to leads of specific card numbers).]]></description>

We would want to do that region by region, I&#039;m guessing. But doing that requires lots of testing. At what unit of government are tests ordered (like, county or state?) and how do they decide which order to go in? 

Each region would want to get off the shutdown as soon as possible, but limited tests mean we can&#039;t all do it at once. And if a region *fails* its test that means we &quot;wasted&quot; a bunch of tests that we could have used to unlock a different region. 

I&#039;m at a loss for how to coordinate this. Do we want bidding wars between regions for tests?]]></description>
