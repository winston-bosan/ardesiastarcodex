					<description><![CDATA[This stuff truly is mind boggling. I run a local business and it&#039;s crazy how much this COVID-19 stuff has turned my business upside down. Now it&#039;s not all bad, we&#039;ve adjusted to the situation slightly and hope things will pick up here soon. But this &quot;social distancing&quot; has definitely shocked our workers as we typically deal with customers in their home.

We&#039;re now in a time that I&#039;m honestly a little nervous for myself and my smaller business. I would assume I&#039;m not the only one who looks at this from a long term perspective. And that is if we don&#039;t see the end of the tunnel soon here in the next few weeks, many businesses are going to feel the pinch and struggle. 

Even the news sites are putting the stories out there about it:

					<description><![CDATA[That is an interesting point/ direction of inquiry. What makes certain government action (or attempts at action) more inefficient (or even laughably incompetent) than others? Why can China build a hospital in 10 days and the US can&#039;t create test kits or simple face masks? The common sense libertarian arguments of &quot;governments are inefficient because they don&#039;t have competition/ market pressures&quot; do explain SOME of government inefficiencies, but when you see the vast variety in government&#039;s capacity to get some things done versus others these explanations seem insufficient. 

It seems that perhaps another significant piece of the puzzle is that governments who restrict what they can and can&#039;t do (rule of law, human rights, etc) face certain inefficiencies due to these self-imposed restrictions. 

Anyways, I&#039;m getting very far from Scott&#039;s original piece which provoked this line of thought. Thanks for the feedback-

					<description><![CDATA[Scott: very entertaining article, although I disagreed with the general poo pooing of the CDC, FDA, etc. Not that they haven&#039;t handled this terribly- of course they have (most likely incompetence, but possibly intentional in order to avoid testing and therefore reduce &quot;panic&quot;). But treating this as &quot;government regulation, screwing things up again lol&quot; seems the worst point that could be made given the obvious success of the Chinese government at containing the virus relative to more open societies like europe and the US. If there&#039;s one thing totalitarianism can do much better than democratic capitalism it&#039;s contain a pandemic. 

Ultimately, this virus- and the efficacy of &quot;totalitarian&quot; top down strategies at containing it (and the complete inability of western countries to do so) represents a greater threat to privacy, freedom of speech, freedom of movement, etc than anything else I&#039;ve seen in my short life- including 9/11. If we develop some treatment or cure quickly it could be a huge face saving moment, but if millions die in the US and Europe while our stock exchanges go lower than 08 lows, the age of democracy and free markets may actually be on it&#039;s way out as we wake from our liberal slumber to the reality China already sees. Because, while free societies are better at some things, they are not better at controlling something like this. At least not in the way they are currently organized.

PS- south Korea is democratic and capitalistic but has also been able to contain its outbreak (using strategies similar to China&#039;s but very different from Italy&#039;s strategies and europe/ the USA&#039;s current strategies). So this doesn&#039;t have to be some capitalism vs communism showdown reminiscent of the cold war. But the effective strategies South Korea has used (using personal data to track cases, masks, widespread testing, disinfecting public transit) have not, suffice it to say, been &quot;laissez faire.&quot; The FDA and CDC might suck, but not bc theyre government organizations. The Chinese and South Korean versions of these institutions have handled this much better, and they did so not by deregulating the f out of everything.]]></description>

The &#060;18% number is based on a model.  The &#062;50% number is based on measurement.  Ideally someone would follow up on the asymptomatic &lt;i&gt;Diamond Princess&lt;/i&gt; cases and find out if the model was accurate.]]></description>

why would global warming cause &#039;erosion of Western political powers (such as Europe and the USA)&#039;?  Canada, Sweden, Germany and Poland will all see milder temperatures, longer growing seasons, etc.  Why would that lead to erosion of political powers?   The US case is a little more complex-- bad for Florida and Louisiana, good for the midwest and especially Alaska and the upper midwest, eg Nebraska, North and South Dakota, etc, difficult to call for the southwest-- say 50% chance it gets wetter, and maybe a big win, 50% chance it doesn&#039;t get wetter and remains basically desert... Hard to see how any of that is going to lead to erosion of political powers.  Unless mass hysteria leads to tearing down fossil fuel power plants and replacing them with wind and solar power.  Germany has definitely shot herself in the foot on that one.]]></description>
