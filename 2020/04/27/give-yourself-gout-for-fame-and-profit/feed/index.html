I also think dehydration plays a big role. I, too, was diagnosed at a young age, about 28. My father, 30 years older, was diagnosed shortly afterward. Obviously, that&#039;s unusual.

One major difference between my life and his: I travel internationally for work frequently, while he mostly worked for domestic companies. It&#039;s easy to get dehydrated on long flights. I think this made a significant difference. Most flareups came shortly after a trip, also. Now, I make sure to drink as much water as possible on flights.

I also drink tart cherry juice, which has significant anti-oxidants and has been clinically shown to reduce flareup duration and intensity. With daily allopurinol, I haven&#039;t had any symptoms for the past year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Anecdotally, I&#039;ve known four people with gout. One was a young college student of average intelligence and ambition, one was a severely disabled alcoholic, one was an overweight depressed homeless individual, and yet another was applying for disability for a combo of physical and mental ailments, including the gout.

I&#039;d personally always associated gout with poverty and poor health for this reason. I knew about the kings in the old days but I always figured they had gout because of obesity problems.]]></description>

Did Newton have gout during his annus mirabilis of 1666-1667 or decades later when he was a rich, successful civil servant but past his scientific prime? Tuberculosis was notoriously a young genius&#039;s disease. I doubt if tuberculosis made its victims more brilliant, but that was a popular theory back when both TB and gout were common, whereas I&#039;ve never heard of people back then theorizing that gout made you smarter.]]></description>

It&#039;s a bit easier to find them in non-American grocery stores - I can get at least tongue, maybe a couple kinds, at least one kind of heart, I believe tripe, and I think a couple other things, at my local Chinese supermarket - and they do come with whole chickens, but yes. On the other hand, my understanding is that organ meats were pretty cheap back when they were more common - one of the ways to get some sort of meat if you didn&#039;t have the budget for something fancy. I wasn&#039;t personally making observations a few decades ago; does that match your experience?

If so, have you considered the hypothesis that the majority of people haven&#039;t gotten less fond of organ meats, they&#039;ve just gotten more capable of affording meats they always liked better?]]></description>

One would think so if the original research was valid. I&#039;m curious if it could have been someone stumbling across the right answer for the wrong reasons. 

If urine of those in a manic episode was so different, couldn&#039;t it be used for diagnostic purposes?

It seems odd.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a simpler explanation: rich&#038;successful people have until recently been fat - being fat has historically been a mark of success (it&#039;s only recently that thinness has become a sign of wealth).
There&#039;s a link between obesity and the production of uric acid: https://www.jbc.org/content/288/38/27138
So, the inference isn&#039;t high uric acid -&#062; success but rather:
Success -&#062; obesity -&#062; high uric acid -&#062; gout.

(Also, ordinary people would not have had the details of their lives remarked upon, regardless of them having or not having gout.)

Nice theory, though. It had me wondering whether my sensitivity to caffeine is related to my high uric acid levels ...]]></description>

Organ meats are definitely less prized than they used to be, judging by the paucity of them on supermarket shelves.  One of my local supermarkets still does lamb&#039;s liver, the other has none.  (Obviously there will still be some in processed meats and pies etc.)

A few decades ago, you&#039;d see at least liver and kidneys from several different species, along with tripe - and I think I&#039;ve seen sheep&#039;s hearts in a supermarket too.]]></description>
