&lt;blockquote&gt;First SK did it without lockdowns,&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Incorrect. They locked down Daegu.

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is zero reason to believe that Rs will stay flat under current policies, because the R level depends on the compliance (voluntary or involuntary) and your position assumes static (or perpetually favorable changes in) behaviors.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of course I don&#039;t expect that R0 will always remain exactly constant. But the pattern seen in many countries is that it remains constant or even decreases as the lockdown continues. (The decrease because we gradually figure out things like &quot;masks help&quot; and &quot;outdoor areas are safer than indoor&quot;.) And in most developed countries (though perhaps the US is more akin to a third world country in the strength of its social fabric and government mechanisms), R0 under lockdown decreases quickly enough that within a few months of lockdown, the case levels are low enough for lockdown to be gradually lifted. This is happening right now in a number of European countries.

&lt;blockquote&gt;the US has 150 million+ legal entries into the country most years&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This isn&#039;t a normal year, needless to say. There need not be any legal entries &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/countries-that-kept-a-lid-on-coronavirus-look-to-each-other-to-revive-their-economies-11588424855&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;except from other countries that controlled the virus&lt;/a&gt;. (Though a safe mechanism could probably worked out for immediate quarantine coming off the plane, if that&#039;s important enough.) As for illegal entries, there will be some of those (many fewer than normal because there aren&#039;t jobs in the US), but these can be suppressed more forcefully than normal, and anyway only a tiny proportion of the population in Mexico or Canada is infected, so the number of cases entering this way would be minimal (and easily controlled by contact tracing).]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;No you don’t. You just have to get the number of cases low enough that you can use contact tracing to isolate the remaining cases and their contacts, while everyone else goes about their lives, and thereby eliminate the virus completely. South Korea is doing this as we speak.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

First SK did it without lockdowns, you cannot translate that to a country with lockdowns because R is behavior dependent, unless you explicitly are claiming that people&#039;s behavior will be exactly the same in a country like the US after lockdown as it was in SK without the lockdowns.

Secondly your claim was that getting the R0 below 1 was evidence for lockdowns, and that is the claim being pushed back on.  There is zero reason to believe that Rs will stay flat under current policies, because the R level depends on the compliance (voluntary or involuntary) and your position assumes static (or perpetually favorable changes in) behaviors.  


&lt;blockquote&gt;There won’t be any outside reinfection if you don’t let people from outside enter the country, or else quarantine/test those who do enter.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Nice spherical cow, the US has 150 million+ legal entries into the country most years, if 1% are infected and there is a 1% false negative rate for the test then a normal travel year would mean 15,000 imported infections a year from tested travelers on top of however many untested travelers exist.]]></description>

Should have been, but there are lots of complications, many of those have now been worked out though (for my wife&#039;s and I imagine many people&#039;s companies).]]></description>

@ Anna:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Askin questions to somebody who is banned is a bit rude, since they can’t answer.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#039;m sorry, I didn&#039;t realise he was banned. Regardless, though, it was more a rhetorical question than anything else.

@ John Schilling:

Britain&#039;s goals were to prevent any power gaining hegemony over *Europe*, out of fear that such a power would be able to conquer Britain. There&#039;s no evidence that the UK ever sought to disunite the US, in the 1860s or at any other time.

@ Bullseye:

Tariffs or not, trade with the US was still very lucrative for Britain. &quot;They didn&#039;t want to fight for slavery&quot; is an inadequate explanation, because (a) Union war goals, especially in the early stages of the war, were all about quashing secession, not about ending slavery. Whilst with hindsight we know that the Union victory led to abolition, this outcome wasn&#039;t the most obvious one at the start of the war. From a foreign perspective, the war was one slave-owning country trying to secede from another slave-owning country. (b) The British had a non-slavery-related casus belli during the Trent affair, when (nota bene) international opinion was firmly on the British side of the dispute and any British declaration of war would have been seen as a justifiable assertion of the freedom of the seas. If Britain had really wanted to go to war, they could simply have sent a much more unreasonable ultimatum and then used the inevitable Union rejection as an excuse for fighting. That they didn&#039;t indicates that they had no desire to fight the Union.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;The soviet regime was very, very unpopular.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Indeed. In Ukraine, people welcomed Nazis as liberators from genocidal Stalin&#039;s regime that already killed millions of them. But Nazis wasted this historical luck by... well, by being Nazis... and thus of course having more important priorities than defeating Russia.

(Compare with Lenin, years ago, who promised independence to every minority that joins him to defeat Tsar&#039;s regime. Only after defeating the former regime and getting power, he turned against his former allies, one by one. This is the difference smart evil and stupid evil.)]]></description>

U.S. tariffs at the time protected northern industry from British and French imports, and also restricted exports of cotton and tobacco to Britain and France. Britain and France didn&#039;t get involved because it would look bad to go to war for slavery, but they did want the Confederacy to win.

Going to school in the South I was taught that these tariffs were a bigger reason for the war than slavery, but after reading South Carolina&#039;s declaration of secession I don&#039;t believe it.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;I mean, what’s Tesla selling point compared to any other electric car brand other than Elon’s eccentric bigger-than-life persona?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Model S is a legitimate luxury/performance car in its own right, on par with e.g. a BMW 5-series, but tailored to the tastes of upscale Millenials and Generation Z.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why would Britain want to get involved in the first place? &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since EC isn&#039;t here, I&#039;ll have a go at this for him.  British foreign policy for the past five hundred years has been to cock up any attempt by anyone &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; British to establish political unity on any scale that could conceivably threaten Britain&#039;s global imperial ambitions.  That&#039;s the only way for a small island off the European coast to maintain itself as a, possibly &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt;, global superpower.  Which particularly in the 19th century, was a massively profitable gig for the British.

The United States of America, had the obvious and predictable potential for replacing the British Empire in that role, and of course ultimately did.  A bunch of conspicuously &lt;i&gt;Disunited&lt;/i&gt; States of America, much less so.  The British did like the Yankees, and they disliked slavery, but they also liked cheap cotton and disliked sharing the oceans with the United States Navy, and this is politics and diplomacy - some likes and dislikes count far more than others.

If siding with the Confederacy was a cheap way to cock up the nascent American Empire, they&#039;d have used e.g. the Trent affair as an excuse to do it.  But not if it looks like they can get the same benefit without direct military intervention, and not if it looks like it intervention will be a prolonged and expensive affair.  That leaves a narrow band in which British intervention is plausible, and the Confederacy skipped through that part too quickly.]]></description>

<p>If siding with the Confederacy was a cheap way to cock up the nascent American Empire, they&#8217;d have used e.g. the Trent affair as an excuse to do it.  But not if it looks like they can get the same benefit without direct military intervention, and not if it looks like it intervention will be a prolonged and expensive affair.  That leaves a narrow band in which British intervention is plausible, and the Confederacy skipped through that part too quickly.</p>
