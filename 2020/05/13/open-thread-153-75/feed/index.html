They&#039;d be more amazed by the ceramics. Arguably, kevlar is just a high tech evolution of cloth armor like the gambeson. Layered fabric armor was both way more common and way more effective than is generally appreciated outside of military history/re-enactment circles :)

Although I should take this opportunity to note: Kevlar is armor optimized to diffuse the kinetic energy of a bullet, NOT to resist a sharp object! Ballistic armor IS NOT necessarily Stab armor (though you can buy armor that is rated for both).]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;since if men and women (or white and non-white men) get different punishment, then at least one group is presumably being over- or under-punished.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
That doesn&#039;t follow. The optimal punishment depends, among other things, on the characteristics of the offender. Those might differ by group.]]></description>

That&#039;s really cool information. I hadn&#039;t realized how far armor ceramics had progressed! Imagine going back to the chain mail days and telling them that fabric and pottery will be able to stop rounds that fly faster and harder than a longbow arrow.]]></description>

@Nancy Lebovitz

The appropriate level of punishment is very complex, with a lot of factors being involved. I didn&#039;t say that I didn&#039;t care about it, but I don&#039;t have very strong opinions about it given how complex it is and how little definitive data there is.

Fair punishment is much more simple, because if you reject discrimination, it is wrong per se. It also has a makes for a fairly simple argument to equalize punishment when aiming for efficacy of punishment, since if men and women (or white and non-white men) get different punishment, then at least one group is presumably being over- or under-punished. This also makes research more complex, since if you want to test efficacy, you now need to separate between groups. And if you find that a group reacts poorly to punishment, it is hard to figure out if it is because they get treated differently or because of that group reacting differently to the same punishment.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Because it seems to me that it’s the actual doing of it that provides the value, while the supposed “freedom” to do so is of no use if you don’t choose to do it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Having the freedom to do it means that you will do it when doing so is on net valuable to you, won&#039;t if it isn&#039;t. Having the restaurant closed means you won&#039;t do it at all.]]></description>

I&#039;m a little bit confused by this. Are people in Sweden exercising the sort of freedoms you&#039;re talking about? For instance, my academic colleagues that live in Sweden, although they are still occasionally going to restaurants, definitely aren&#039;t doing so at anywhere near the rate they did before, and are most definitely not doing anything near the amount of travel they would have done. Is it important that they have the *freedom* to do it? Or is it the actual travel that is important? Because it seems to me that it&#039;s the actual doing of it that provides the value, while the supposed &quot;freedom&quot; to do so is of no use if you don&#039;t choose to do it.]]></description>

This sounds related to the idea of &quot;intuitive eating&quot;, which I think of as careful introspection to see if you really want a fatty/proteiny meal or really want something salty or something else, assuming that your internal senses will give you a better idea of what you are currently slightly deficient in than following some specific diet.]]></description>
