		<div class="comment-body"><p>I asked before about the flimsiness of doors in the US. I was quite surprised with these protests to see how unprotected stores are (other than fire alarms). </p>
<p>In Spain, even in not-bad areas of town, many shops have metallic doors like <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.puertas-metalicas.es/tipos-de-puertas-metalicas-para-su-negocio/" rel="nofollow ugc">this</a>? It wouldn&#8217;t protect the big stores, but it would require something more than a brick to break into. Determined thieves still do it, breaking into jewelery stores and whatnot, but again, it would require some more preparation.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>So that&#8217;s probably a dumb question, but I&#8217;m going to ask it anyway. What&#8217;s the [measurable] goal of the George Floyd protests? Or the people peacefully demanding something to be done? Do they demand anything more specific than &#8220;change&#8221;? The guy who did it is already under investigation and I can&#8217;t imagine any way for him to get out lightly. And I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a way to change regulations for the police to prevent it from happening again, since strangling someone to death because you don&#8217;t like him is most likely already against those regulations. So, is there any specific act the government or the police should do to make the protesters say &#8220;ok, our joib is done here, let&#8217;s go home&#8221;?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>What&#8217;s the goal of a volcanic eruption? </p>
<p>You can analyze the  mechanical forces leading up to an eruption, but the goal of an eruption is a non-sensical concept. </p>
<p>The protesters, looters, and arsonists are not members of an organization that gives them direction in pursuit of an objective. They are a mass of people reacting to the physics  of social forces.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The protestors aren&#8217;t a monolith. But some simple demands are:</p>
<p>1. Bring appropriate charges against those involved in the murder (which no, does not include the absurd third degree murder charges for strangling an unarmed person to death). </p>
<p>2. Abolition of qualified immunity. </p>
<p>3. Bring charges against those who lied and protected the violent police, in the Minnesota case and in many others. </p>
<p>4. De-funding and disarming the police.</p>
<p>So there you have it. Do these things, and I&#8217;ll call off my friends who are out in the streets.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My guess is that, although the immediate cause is this incident, part of the reason that it resulted in such an extreme reaction this time is the lockdown. A lot of people are feeling angry and oppressed, hence more willing to take extreme actions in response to something.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I just got an alert on my phone for a curfew in San Jose starting at 8:30 (received alert at 7:36). </p>
<p>This morning, I saw a post on Facebook from one of my friends back in Atlanta complaining about how they declared the curfew with little or no notice, with some people not getting the notifications until <i>after</i> the curfew started, which, combined with the shutdown of public transportation, meant that innocent people were likely to get stranded downtown and caught up in the police arrests.</p>
<p>Obviously, the San Jose one went out with a little more notice than that, but I&#8217;m still wondering why they give so little notice. Why can&#8217;t they send the alerts out hours in advance so people have more time to plan?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Our curfew was declared in several places beforehand and the universal alert system (the mandatory notifications on your phone etc) was used about two hours before it started and when it started. So no idea. The tone was a little imperious but otherwise I felt well informed despite not being highly engaged with local news or postings.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I’ve got a close friend who’s a journalist and also a small female. Occasionally when she is out doing stuff that might not be best for a small female to be doing, I tag along to help her stay safe. One of the things she was tasked to do was cover protests as they happened this weekend so decided to help out and take pictures.</p>
<p>I spent around 5 hours in a protest and watched it turn from chanting behind barricades to people actively fighting with the cops and setting shit on fire. I was shot with pepper balls, got slightly burned when a mis-thrown firecracker exploded around a yard away from me and was present as tear gas was being used. Here are some takeaways, in no particular order:</p>
<p>&#8211;	It kind of reminded me of a kind of battlefield. Cops are in a line and all have shields; they want hold their ground. Right in front of them is a line of protesters screaming at them, but not actually doing any damage. Behind the initial line of protestors is the people throwing stuff. It started out just being water bottles, then escalated to bricks and impromptu-explosives as the night went on. Occasionally the peaceful front line of protestors stops being peaceful and either tears down a barricade or tries to push the cops. At this point, the cops directly being attacked would just hold them off with their shields while cops behind the line would launch tear gas and cops from the side would start clubbing/shooting until the protesters would back off; only for the (now peaceful, again) front line to reform a few minutes later. This is happening all up and down a long line continuously for hours. </p>
<p>&#8211;	A good portion of the damage is either done, or at least incited by a small group of people. Most people just want to protest, but some people want to just cause chaos. I’d put it initially at ~5% of people being there for violence t the start, increasing as the night went on as tempers started to flare. </p>
<p>&#8211;	I only saw a couple of cops go down, both of them after getting pegged with a rock or a brick. I saw far more protesters go down; some of them were wounded by the cops, more injured by other protesters missing with their projectiles. Mis-thrown bricks, fireworks and bottles were a big risk. </p>
<p>&#8211;	Always bring PPE to a protest. I went in a military-grade gas mask, had hearing protection and wore and padded vest. I didn’t feel totally safe in that, and definitely wouldn’t have wanted to wear any less. That being said, I saw people half my size out there wearing just a sports bra and bandanna, so maybe I’m just a wimp.  </p>
<p>&#8211;	There were some looters, but many blocks away from where the protesters were. I finally get why the argument of “why don’t the protesters stop the looters” doesn’t work. A few blocks during a protest is really far, especially once the cops start herding you in. I only learned about it because I saw them starting after I slipped past the police line and made my way home. </p>
<p>&#8211;	Antifa was there but weren’t very numerous and generally weren’t the ones starting trouble. I get that some of you aren’t going to believe this, but the people decked out in full black with the communist/anarchist gear on were mostly the ones acting as medics and breaking up fights that broke up amongst the protesters. I saw two MAGA people who tried to counter-protest, both were causing tension within the crowd and it looked like it might get ugly until the black bloc folks would swarm in, isolate the counter protest and get them out of there. They were also the ones who were most aware of where the police were and what they were doing and keeping paths open for people who wanted to leave. That being said, every time the front line turned violent, there were also some antifa looking people there, so I wouldn’t say they were entirely a force for peace.</p>
<p>&#8211;	Most of the people I saw starting the violence were male teenagers (all races). Something about being 18 and having a license to do violence must be appealing. </p>
<p>&#8211;	Improvised weapons were really common; I saw multiple home-made flamethrowers. </p>
<p>&#8211;	Speaking of flamethrowers, there was a lot of fire. Cars, dumpsters, signs, a building… basically if it was nearby and vaguely flammable, it got lit up. </p>
<p>&#8211;	I was pretty impressed by the cops. They were pretty well controlled and didn’t cause too many injuries. Despite going crazy on the gas, they were pretty restrained in their use of pepper spray. I also only saw around a half-dozen people get seriously injured by their clubs, which, given the size of the protest and the truly vile things some of the protesters were screaming at them… seemed reasonable.</p>
<p>EDIT: </p>
<p>Another group that really amazed me were the street medics. These were people who showed up in full protest gear decked out with red crosses. When the gas came out, they&#8217;d run in, help people who couldn&#8217;t see get out safely and spray them down with neutralizing agent. When people got sprayed, they broke out the milk jugs. When the cops beat people down or someone got hit with a brick, they were there to take them out and get them bandaged up. </p>
<p>I saw one medic run into a stampede of people running away from something the cops did to pick up a woman who had been pushed over and looked at risk for getting trampled. Really impressive group of people overall.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Thanks for the description. Do you feel like there is anything the cops could have done to alleviate tensions? Is there anything the 95% or protestors that weren&#8217;t there to cause problems could have done? If you don&#8217;t mind saying, what city was this?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Do you feel like there is anything the cops could have done to alleviate tensions?</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, but I&#8217;m also not an expert in crowd control, so maybe my ideas would have been stupid. At the beginning of the protest there were these metal fences in front of the crowd and the cops were around 20 feet back from the fences. Any protester got in that no-mans land would be hit with pepper balls until they backed off, but other than that the cops were just blocking the occasional water bottle. </p>
<p>Eventually though, the protectors tore down the metal fence and threw it back into the street. When this happened, the cops charged forward to where the fence had been. There was now basically no space between the line of protesters and the line of cops, which imo, incited more violence. If they&#8217;d either pre-staged less flimsy fences or had some way of reimposing distance between the crowds and the cops, I think you would have seen less interactions. </p>
<blockquote><p>Is there anything the 95% or protestors that weren’t there to cause problems could have done?</p></blockquote>
<p>They, or at least some of them tried. People were on loudspeakers saying &#8220;stop burning stuff&#8221; and &#8220;Stop throwing stuff.&#8221; I saw and personally took part in trying to stop people who were tearing up bricks. The coolest thing I saw all night was one dude spin-kick a flamethrower out of someone else&#8217;s hand who was trying to ignite a pile of clothes. It was good, but most of the 95% are just there to protest. They didn&#8217;t sign up to fight with the cops OR fight with violent protesters so they just rubbernecked. </p>
<p>The issue is, it&#8217;s really hard to isolate out the bad actors. It looks like a group of &#8220;normal&#8221; protesters until suddenly they&#8217;ve all got bricks. Then, they&#8217;ve thrown the bricks. Now they&#8217;re scattering so the cops can&#8217;t hit them with whatever, only to re-converge later. </p>
<p>If there had been leadership to the protest, maybe something different would have happened, but this was headless so there wasn&#8217;t any way to control the worst elements. </p>
<blockquote><p>If you don’t mind saying, what city was this?</p></blockquote>
<p>DC. All of this was happening at the park right in front of the white house.</p>

<p>This is the core of the issue, and why my own $0.02 cents is that there is basically no solution for the problem of &#8220;How do we control and contain protests without some %-age of &#8216;innocent&#8217; protesters getting caught between the &#8216;bad&#8217; protesters and the cops?&#8221;. Bottom line, if you are standing in massed group of people, and some of those people are violently chucking things at another group of people, and you are physically interposing yourself between that second group and the chuckers, <i>you are aiding and abetting said violent individuals</i>. You are helping them do what they do. It may not be what you <i>intend</i> to do, but it is what you <i>are</i> doing. </p>
<p>The only way to NOT aid and abet them is either: </p>
<p>A) police their behavior yourself. As noted, there is maybe some of that, but for most part the protesters either came to fight no one or to fight cops, no one really wants to get into fights with other protesters.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>B) Get out of the way and/or actively try to offer up the offending members to the police. But in a mass crowd, getting out of the way is going to be difficult or even impossible for a lot of individuals. Furthermore,  getting out of the way means breaking up and weakening the protest, abandoning/weakening the cause, etc etc. The whole purpose and leverage of a protest is to provide a united front, to present yourselves as a monolith. For similar reasons, aiding and abetting police efforts to single out and remove the bad actors is something that rarely happens. More often even in protests where it&#8217;s practical for the cops to sally a force into the main body of the protest, find the rock/brick/etc chuckers, subdue and cuff them, then drag them out of that body and away, the protesters are more apt to physically block and interfere with the police or swarm them, not to get out of the way and go &#8220;It&#8217;s him, Officers! The guy with white khakhis, black hoodie, and keffiyeh neckerchief! He&#8217;s the one throwing bricks! Arrest him!&#8221;.</p>
<p>As for </p>
<blockquote><p>If they’d either pre-staged less flimsy fences or had some way of reimposing distance between the crowds and the cops,</p></blockquote>
<p>A barrier that is both temporary and immune to the combined power of several hundred pissed off people is a fairly tall order. They exist, but they tend to run along the lines of Hesco barrier/concertainer construction. Fencing in protesters behind a 6-10&#8242; tall, 3&#8242; wide earthen wall isn&#8217;t the sort of thing you can throw up on a whim, and starts to push the definition of &#8220;temporary&#8221;.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Imagine you are in the U.S. military fighting a heated battle in Fallujah.  You see a fellow soldier next to you do something that is clearly against the rules of engagement.  Do you say to your other fellow soldiers, &#8220;Let&#8217;s get him!&#8221; and run over and detain your misbehaving soldier?  No.  I guarantee you that something like that is never done in the U.S. military, or any military.  In the heat of the moment, you let it slide because it would be absolutely awful for morale and organization to &#8220;cop-jacket&#8221; a member of your side, even if their actions seem really quite heinous.  Note that there occasionally are some liberal protesters who will try to &#8220;cop-jacket&#8221; violent protesters, and usually it does NOT go over well with the other protesters (as in, the liberal will be swarmed and vigorously escorted away), unless the protest is EXTREMELY liberal-oriented and there are only like 1 or 2 protesters who are in a more aggressive mood.  Unless non-violent liberals have these overwhelming numbers, most liberals will let it slide.  </p>
<p>Now, that said, in the U.S. military I&#8217;m sure there would be after-action reports and courts-martialling where a soldier would later on be held accountable.  This is difficult for protests to do because of anonymity, unless it is some extremely discipline tankie (i.e. Stalinist or Maoist) cell whose members are willing to undergo &#8220;self-criticism&#8221; sessions afterwards for their bad calls or bad spur-of-the-moment impulses during the protest.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>In the military you also have the advantage of an entire hierarchical organization and institutional culture that is, on the whole, dedicated to enforcing the laws of land warfare. So what generally happens is that the relevant authority (whether NCO or officer) intervenes to stop the behavior and there is an investigation and possible punishment after the fact. Of course, this can break down, most often when the one going bad IS a NCO or officer and takes his subordinates with him (for an example of what that looks like, see SSG Gibbs and company in Afghanistan in 2009), but as you said outside of maybe a really regimented sort of protest group, there&#8217;s no sort of structure to even try and enforce internal discipline.</p>

<p>This is the major issue and the logic works both ways.  When good cops close ranks to defend bad cops they are no longer good cops.  When a protest starts getting violent you either leave or are part of a violent protest.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>I guarantee you that something like that is never done in the U.S. military, or any military. </p></blockquote>
<p>Then you clearly have no idea what you&#8217;re talking about. </p>
<p>Anyways, all this talk about how protesters are incapable of policing their own completely ignores how, whenever you have large groups of armed protesters, and thus a real incentive not to escalate, this doesn&#8217;t happen.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Keep in mind too that a protest can be extremely confusing, figuring out who is on which side, especially if you suspect that there might be plainclothes officers or counter-protesters or agent provocateurs in your midst.  One reason it matters is, plainclothes cops have been known to try to snatch leaders or otherwise important vocal individuals out of protests via several plainclothes officers swarming the target and quickly manhandling them out of the crowd to police lines before the rest of the protesters even understand what is going on.  </p>
<p>So the protesters can suddenly find themselves in a game of mafia/werewolf where they have about all of 2 seconds to suddenly consensually decide who is friend or foe.  If you try to cop-jacket someone, unless the protest has the atmosphere of a Sunday picnic, you are liable to cause a panic, misunderstandings, unintentional injuries between protesters because people might think YOU are a plainclothes officer, until you can explain otherwise.  At a BLM protest yesterday I witnessed protesters bolt like a herd of animals the other day over something that ended up being nothing, and which I thought was nothing at the time, and it took every ounce of willpower to not give in to the urge to bolt as well.  That thing that causes some people to bolt and which gets the avalanche rolling could be as simple as suddenly yelling, &#8220;He&#8217;s a cop!&#8221; which I&#8217;m sure some agent provocateur has done at some point just to mess with protesters and disrupt them.  And in the meantime, the protest phalanx is broken and who knows how many protesters the police may be able to peel off into their paddywagons.  And even if you just try to lecture them to not be violent, know-it-all SJW-style, unless they know you they might think you are still a plainclothes officer who is trying to sow confusion and dissension in the protesters&#8217; ranks&#8230;or they might just blow you off as some naive liberal.  </p>
<p>Another reason that protest cohesion is important is, there is often a turning point (i.e. when it stops having the atmosphere of a Sunday picnic) where a protester can sense that it is no longer safe to leave a protest alone, and where it has to be carefully managed.  Fascists may be lurking to beat up protesters (probably rare, but still a salient possibility in people&#8217;s minds), and police will try to round up stragglers as they leave the protest to go to their car/subway/bike, whatever.  You might think that you&#8217;ve been picture-perfectly-peaceful during the whole thing and thus have nothing to fear, but you know that the police don&#8217;t know that.  They can&#8217;t keep track of who has done what in a protest.  So it is quite common to round up stragglers as they try to leave and see if any other officers have evidence against them, have witnessed something, can find something on you, etc.  And even if they can&#8217;t prove anything (and keep in mind that you could be innocent but an officer could be honestly mistaken and think that it was you doing something earlier in the protest, and now it&#8217;s your word against his), you still might have to languish in jail for who knows however long.  So, protester cohesion is doubly-important for this reason.  </p>
<p>These sorts of non-Sunday picnic protests can be incredibly stressful, but also there are some people who really get off on it.  There is definitely a subculture of &#8220;riotp0rn&#8221; people who love to watch riotp0rn and/or participate in it themselves, but its influence is definitely over-stated (and this group sometimes overlaps with anti-fascists, but sometimes not.  There can be more soberly-disciplined anti-fascists, and some loners not really affiliated with any political grouping who just get off on the excitement and intrigue).  I think what is alarming a lot of people right now is the realization that concurrent protests are happening in so many cities in the country, even in small towns that don&#8217;t have a &#8220;tradition&#8221; of riotpr0n, that they know it can&#8217;t possibly all be due to a merry band of career-miscreants causing everything (although that hasn&#8217;t stopped some of the media from trying to emphasize that narrative&#8230;)</p>

<p>Yeah, I saw this being weilded &#8220;offensively&#8221; a bunch if this makes sense:<br />
-Someone gets violent with cops<br />
-cops respond with violence<br />
-dozens of people swarm forward with their hands up going &#8220;hands up, don&#8217;t shoot&#8221;<br />
-people who did violence on cops get away. </p>
<p>Yes, they didn&#8217;t do anything violent, but their actions at worst contributed to more violence and at best revealed that the only violence they care about is the violence going towards the cops, not coming from them.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>EDIT to respond to Aftagley, who responded while I was writing this comment:</p>
<p>Exactly the sort of dynamic I had in mind, yes, though even people who are just doing their &#8220;peaceful protest&#8221; thing and are straight-up oblivious to the rock-throwing are still providing top cover. It&#8217;s one of the reasons I personally will never attend a demonstration for any cause, no matter how much I personally care about said cause. At least, not unless it is a protest organized and run under tight discipline by a group I trust and am a part of.</p>
<p>@BaconBits9</p>
<p>I tend to agree. It&#8217;s the reason I tend to be very much for things like widespread adoption of body cams and against things like police unions. OTOH I don&#8217;t think &#8220;good cops closing ranks to protect bad cops&#8221; Is AS prevalent as some people claim, and that in cases where it does happen it&#8217;s generally localized to specific departments or even precincts/units within specific departments rather than a national epidemic. But that&#8217;s getting back to the top-level discussion rather than the specific topic of how police and groups of mass protesters interact. </p>
<p>@Evelyn Q. Greene </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Citizencokane said that it&#8217;s <i>impossible</i>, just that it is unlikely to happen given the dynamics within protests as they exist. I certainly haven&#8217;t said it&#8217;s impossible. You can absolutely have a very controlled and disciplined protest: Passive Resistance/Non-violent confrontation tactics basically <b>require</b> organizational and individual discipline. But a protest that is planned and organized by a disciplined group is distinctly different from these types of mass protests in several respects. </p>
<p>As far as the armed protesters go, I think there are several factors going on there: </p>
<p>1) So far, armed protesters are actually a minority at most protests, including the anti-lockdown ones. For every one armed protestor you have several more who are unarmed.</p>
<p>2) Armed protesters from the &#8220;Red Tribe&#8221; coded protests (e.g. Anti-Lockdown, Gun Rights stuff, etc) are coming from a gun culture that generally emphasizes conscientiousness and individual responsibility due to the legal requirements involved in firearm ownership and general cultural mores. This is especially true of concealed carry holders.</p>
<p>3) as you noted, the stakes ARE higher. </p>
<p>I think all these factors that combine to make the chance of losing control LOWER. But I don&#8217;t think it lowers it to zero. There were several people wounded by someone with a firearm in Louisville, Kentucky a day or two ago in one of the associated protests for example. Personally, I think that 1) and 2) are the most important factors that have prevented any ugly incidents. But that&#8217;s only &#8220;so far&#8221;. I think that if you get a sufficiently large number of armed protesters together without institutional and organizational discipline, then sooner or later reversion to the mean will come along to bite everyone in the ass.</p>

<p>I have no idea how prevalent it is, I bring it up as an example because I think it cuts across the statements that we should let peaceful protesters be when there are only a few bad protesters in the mix.  A police department only works in free society if they have the trust of the public, and a peaceful protest only remains a peaceful protest if it is 99.9x% peaceful.</p>

<p>The point is not that protesters should be policing each other, its that the definition of &#8216;good cop&#8217; switches to &#8216;bad cop&#8217; very easily, and &#8216;peaceful protest&#8217; can switch to &#8216;violent protest&#8217;.  The actions of one bad cop endangers the whole department&#8217;s reputation (as it should) and the actions of a few protesters changes the definition of the entire protest.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The best time to get a protest all on the same page with regards to assertiveness level would probably be before the protest really gets going.  Of course, if you give a briefing in public about this, the police may use your unwillingness to be assertive to your disadvantage and box your protest into a really ineffectual corner.  You also have to have leaders that people are willing to follow.  And you have to make sure new protesters don&#8217;t trickle-in after the briefing, which would usually require a leader to have some sort of arrangement with police marshals beforehand.  That sort of thing is common in permitted marches, but not with these sorts of spontaneous protests. </p>
<p>And that&#8217;s an important thing about these protests:  they aren&#8217;t &#8220;normal&#8221; protests staged by an organization and its members.  They are much more leaderless and spontaneous than usual (which has its pros and cons.  It certainly keeps the police guessing because there&#8217;s no leadership they can really communicate with to agree to quid-pro-quo truces that can be enforced).  Sure, some of them might say that they are led by &#8220;BlackLivesMatter,&#8221; but in reality BLM at that protest will be a guy with a megaphone and 4 other guys he knows.  The rest might flock to the BLM banner, but they are not dues-paying members who are accountable to any sort of organizational discipline&#8230;at least, not yet.  That may change.  The protest in Springfield, MO yesterday had more people actually following the lead of the guy with the megaphone than I&#8217;ve seen elsewhere.</p>

<p>What is &#8220;cop-jacketing?&#8221;  I can&#8217;t find it with a DDG search or looking on Urbandictionary.  I also can&#8217;t figure it out from context, since your comments regarding it being something you wouldn&#8217;t expect military to do to stop violence on the part of their personnel.  A basic infantry attack requires tight control of fires to prevent fratricide, so orders to cease fire are typical and expected to immediately be obeyed and passed down the line&#8211;the doctrinal signal in the US military is to <a rel="nofollow"href="https://youtu.be/ZNFfMRfMvfE?t=141" rel="nofollow ugc">wave your hand in front of your face, palm-out</a>, while shouting &#8220;cease fire&#8221;, and if that didn&#8217;t work, I&#8217;d absolutely expect somebody to put hands on the guy.  About the only thing that comes to mind that&#8217;s left would be shooting him, and that doesn&#8217;t seem to fit what you mean either.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>X-Jacketing is a term, mostly used in far-left circles(?) to accuse someone of being affliated with group X. </p>
<p>Common X values are &#8220;snitch&#8221; &#8220;cop&#8221; &#8220;fed&#8221; &#8220;prison guard&#8221; or whatever. I thing the general term is &#8220;bad jacketing&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;Cop-jacketing&#8221; means a protester trying to forcibly turn over a fellow protester to the police for taking actions that the first protester doesn&#8217;t agree with.  It involves first restraining the reckless protester and then handing the protester over to police lines during a protest.  It is a bit of an obscure activist term.</p>
<p>Edit:  Actually, there may be several inter-related concepts going by the term &#8220;cop-jacketing,&#8221; or maybe my memory is foggy.  On one Occupy Movement website I found this definition of cop-jacketing:  &#8220;accusing people, usually strangers of being police and even harassing them out the park. While it is certainly true that there were undercover police officers in the park, and informants, etc., it is absolutely not alright to publicly accuse people of being police officers if there is no evidence that they are.&#8221;  </p>
<p>The two concepts can intertwine in the scenario where someone&#8217;s aggressive vandalism ignites fears that they are actually an agent provocateur cop such that some people may feel tempted to restrain and push out of the protest such individuals.</p>
<p>2nd edit:  here&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow"href="https://incendiarynews.com/2019/06/27/why-we-call-the-dsa-social-fascists/" rel="nofollow ugc">an article</a> that uses the term &#8220;cop-jacketing&#8221; in the original sense that I meant it, as an act of bringing police to bear on fellow protesters/activists with whom one has a disagreement.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>If they’d either pre-staged less flimsy fences or had some way of reimposing distance between the crowds and the cops, I think you would have seen less interactions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not really possible, anything that keeps the protesters away from the police also keeps the police away from the protesters.  If there is a fight or a fire in the crowd the police can no longer move forward and intervene at all if you have a solid barrier there, and the purpose of the barrier is literally so there is a line that the police know when it is crossed.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure if either my protest was atypical or if I don&#8217;t understand you. The cops were doing precisely nothing to break up fights that didn&#8217;t directly involve them and were unconcerned about fire expect when it was being thrown at them. Mind you, I&#8217;m not saying they should have broken ranks to tend to this stuff, but they were not going past their lines. </p>
<blockquote><p>the purpose of the barrier is literally so there is a line that the police know when it is crossed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yep, this makes sense. I&#8217;ll retract my original point then. In a purely hypothetical world, something that could ensure the cops and protesters stay at least a couple yards away from each other would be great, but it&#8217;s just not feasible.</p>

<p>No, they won&#8217;t be attending to everything, but a barrier that prevents the protesters getting closer basically means they can&#8217;t attend to anything.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Honestly, this Dion Fortune book is great entertainment.  It was published in 1930 and has a marvellous attitude of &#8220;British stiff upper lip&#8221; on show, it&#8217;s also hilarious that she was training in Freudian psychology around the same time that she was serving as an occult initiate (there&#8217;s a vampire story which is something else).</p>
<p>This is less exciting but serves as a good example of the breezily down-to-earth tone of her anecdotes (don&#8217;t try this at home, kids, apparently Air Rituals are notorious for evoking quarrels and being destructive):</p>
<blockquote><p>The ceremony went exceptionally badly even for an Air Ritual. Two of the principal officers, husband and wife, helped to maintain its reputation as a contentious element by having a family jar in the middle of the proceedings, and the usual upsets and smashings occurred on a generous scale. </p>
<p>For the next fortnight I lived in the midst of a cataclysm of crockery. I smashed my way through two entire tea-sets and all the mantelpiece ornaments. The ornaments just fell off the mantelpiece one by one of their own accord. I actually saw two of them do it. I did not know at the time that the Element of Air had this sinister reputation. I realised that something queer was afoot, however, and asked my teacher about it. She was much amused, but I was not, because it was my crockery that was supplying the raw material for the phenomena.</p></blockquote>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s the contrast between, to quote Wikipedia (when she would have been in her early 20s):</p>
<blockquote><p>To recover from her experience at Studley, Fortune began studying psychotherapy. Her initial interest was in the work of Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler, though she later moved on to that of Carl Jung. She studied psychology and psychoanalysis under John Flügel at the University of London, before gaining employment at a psychological clinic in London&#8217;s Brunswick Square, which was likely run under the jurisdiction of the London School of Medicine for Women.</p></blockquote>
<p>The above, which she mentions herself:</p>
<blockquote><p>When psycho-analysis was first introduced into England I took up the subject, and became a student, and eventually a lecturer at a clinic that was founded in London.  &#8230;At the same place, in the course of my psycho-analytical work, I came across a number of cases where a morbid attachment existed between two people &#8230;We found it necessary to insist upon a separation if a cure were to be effected, and the separation invariably disagreed very actively with the dominant partner.</p>
<p>At that time I explained everything in terms of the Freudian psychology, but even so, I could not help being struck by the curious effect a separation had upon the person who was not supposed to be ill, and that as the one went uphill, the other went down.</p></blockquote>
<p>And then in the next paragraph she&#8217;s describing &#8220;one of these cases turned out to be necrophiliac vampirism contracted in the trenches during the First World War&#8221; and you&#8217;re left going &#8220;huh?&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>At that time I was doing the tutorials in abnormal psychology at the clinic I have spoken of, and supervising the work of the other students; one of them took counsel with me concerning a case that had come to her in private practice, the case of a youth in the late &#8216;teens, one of those degenerate but intellectual and socially presentable types that not infrequently crop up in old families whose blood is too blue to be wholesome.</p>
<p>&#8230;The boy, whom we will call D., was in the habit of going to sit with a cousin who had been invalided home from France suffering from alleged shell-shock. This young man was another scion of a worn-out stock, and it transpired that he had been caught red-handed in that unpleasant perversion called necrophilia. According to the story elicited from the parents of D., this vice was not uncommon on certain sections of the Front, as were also attacks on wounded men. The authorities were taking drastic steps to put it down. Owing to family influence the cousin of D. was able to escape incarceration in a military prison, and was placed in the care of his family as a mental case, and they put him in the charge of a male nurse. It was while the male nurse was off duty that the unfortunate young D. was misguidedly employed to sit with him.  It also came out that the relations between D. and his cousin were of a vicious nature, and on one occasion he bit the boy on the neck, just under the ear, actually drawing blood. </p>
<p>D. had always been under the impression that some &#8220;ghost&#8221; attacked him during his crises, but had not dared to say so for fear of being thought mad.</p>
<p>&#8230;What may have been the exact percentages of neurotic taint, vice, and psychic attack, it is difficult to say, nor is it easy to decide which was the predisposing cause that opened the door to all the trouble, but one thing stood out clearly to all beholders, that with the dispatch of the psychic visitant, not only did D.&#8217;s condition clear up immediately, but after a short, sharp upheaval the cousin also recovered.</p></blockquote>
<p>So it&#8217;s this wonderful blend of &#8220;I think Freud was definitely on to something, but of course his lack of knowledge of occult matters meant that he didn&#8217;t quite get it all the way right about the Oedipus complex&#8221; which is, frankly, hugely amusing to read because it is all being treated in the reasonable air of &#8220;Science is making great strides and psychology and occultism are equally sciences&#8221; which, um, some people might well agree with but not for the same reasons 🙂</p>
<p>Also, the brisk medical tone of &#8220;well, necrophilia during wartime, it happens unfortunately&#8221; is something to experience.</p>
<p>The only caveat I would have for readers who may be sensitive on such issues is that the attitudes to race are very much of their time, so besides the above &#8220;Vampirism?  In <i>my</i> Allied Forces?  It&#8217;s more likely than you think!  Have you any Magyars mingling with the troops under your command?&#8221;, we get the simple, artless peoples are susceptible to seeing things because they are nearer to nature and more sensitive:</p>
<blockquote><p>To perceive a &#8220;haunting&#8221; one needs, as a general rule, to be slightly psychic; it is for this reason that children, Celts and the coloured races suffer severely from such interferences, and the stolid Nordic type is comparatively immune, and, to a lesser extent, the lively, materialistic and sceptical Latin.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, we Irish are but simple peasants which is why we&#8217;re all away with the fairies 😀</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yesterday, I asked for advice about cooking with yogurt since it is so messy and hard to deal with. All the responses I got were just &#8220;get a kitchen scale&#8221;. Coincidentally, my roommate just got one, but I don&#8217;t really see how it answers the question at all. </p>
<p>Could anyone explain how you use the scale to avoid the problems with yogurt getting all over measuring cups and spoons and the like? I&#8217;m guessing you just spoon it into the bowl until the weight reaches the desired amount, but this seems like it would take forever. I already tried just spooning yogurt into a 1/2 cup, and even that takes much longer than I&#8217;d care for.</p>
<p>Also any tips for scale use and baking with weight measures in general?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>For recipes that I have I was always able to add yogurt by weight to a container where it will end anyway.</p>
<p>So I would put container on an electronic scale, reset weight (to measure just what will be added) and add yogurt with a spoon of appropriate size.</p>
<p>In case of unfortunate recipes not using weight I would convert such measures to weight or number of spoons.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Use a big spoon &#8211; a serving spoon or the like &#8211; and just spoon the yogurt into the bowl, then rinse the spoon off.  Don&#8217;t use an eating spoon.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the real killer app for scales is solid fats (lard and so on) which are really messy to measure otherwise.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Kitchen scales are the universal answer to all things baking, in full generality. Measuring anything other than by weight just.. is not accurate enough. Use a large steel bowl, pour things in until you get close to desired weight, then pour slowly, reset between ingredients. for things which cant be poured, large spoon. It helps to think of baking as a subset of chemistry more than of cooking &#8211; mix well, get the ingredients, temperature and timing right, good and consistent results.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I liked the old scheme, too, and so I&#8217;m sorry to see it go. I do wonder why he did it. One explanation is that after removing a bunch of old/defunct? blogs Scott found he couldn&#8217;t retain all the old categories, so he just switched to something simpler. But the explanation I prefer is that he needs those Weirdness Points for an upcoming post.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I enjoyed the old names, but what&#8217;s really bothering me is not the change to the headers text in the blogroll &#8211; it&#8217;s the &#8220;improvement&#8221; to the layout that results in various elements of this blog displaying on top of each other in Safari 11.0.1.</p>
<p>I would very much have preferred that our host not &#8220;fix&#8221; something that hadn&#8217;t previously been broken. </p>
<p>At any rate, I don&#8217;t see the blogroll any more, or (more problematically) the list of recent posts (so as to know when a new OT is posted). It&#8217;s hidden behind a symbol when the page loads (no text label, of course). When you click on the symbol, what used to be a side bar displays much wider than it used to be, covering up the beginning of the post/comments. All in all, the kind of improvement I&#8217;ve come to expect from tech companies, that make their cell phone/tablet experience harder and harder for newcomers to learn, every year &#8211; and their desktop experience more and like their phone and tablet experience.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I&#8217;m familiar with the particular hieroglyph chosen, and was able to find the missing sidebar. (Real tech companies generally use brand new symbols, to maximize user confusion, when modernizing their UIs; Scott&#8217;s a piker compared to Apple or Google, though he&#8217;s got the essential element of having neither always-present text nor tooltips.) </p>
<p>And of course this part may not have been Scott&#8217;s conscious doing; it&#8217;s possible he merely updated to a more recent &#8220;modernized&#8221; version of the blogging platform, perhaps to pick up security fixes unavailable without the UI &#8220;improvements&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also possible my &#8220;preferences&#8221; got changed for the site, via some even less clearly labelled UI element. Until I noticed the change to the blogroll (thanks everyone), that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d presumed. But this looks like a partial site reskinning, no better than they usually are.</p>
<p>I also considered that it may be some issue involving moving advertisements, or changing the technology used to display them &#8211; leading to my ad block software doing something new when it tries to make use of the space previously containing ads. I now see zero advertisements on this site, with only a header for them (on the right). Previously I used to see ads. But my ad block software is claiming to have blocked<i> zero</i> ads today, so it&#8217;s more likely that the site is also failing to serve the usual ads.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The fact that prices are denominated in data rather than dollars does not change anything.</p>
<p>If the government gives Twitter the data they request in exchange for publishing the government&#8217;s communications, Twitter is obliged to treat it no differently than if the government had paid in dollars.  For that matter, if Google uses its monopoly position to demand ever more intrusive data from its users there is no difference, legally or morally, than any other monopolistic price fixing scheme.</p>
<p>You can denominate your price in anything you want, including peppercorns, and it changes neither the nature of the transaction, how binding the contractual terms are, nor the application of the law.</p>

<p>Do we actually know that the Empire abolished slavery on Tatooine, or do you just assume they did because we don&#8217;t explicitly see slaves in the original movies?</p>

<p>I can see that interpretation, but my assumption was the reverse. No one tried to stop them because that&#8217;s just inviting death and by the time we see storm troopers, they&#8217;ve been in the city for a while (Star Wars timelines are always screwy).</p>
<p>Thinking about it, I guess a lot of that is because otherwise the Empire looks pretty incompetent for being totally unable to find the droids, or lock down the port. Now that&#8217;s not impossible, they&#8217;re certainly plenty incompetent a lot of the time (cough, Death Star, cough) but basically a marine detachment operating on foreign soil without any real time to make local contacts made more sense to me.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think I&#8217;ve read somewhere that the Empire did maintain a garrison of stormtroopers on Tatooine, mostly to prevent the Rebel Alliance from setting up a stronghold there, but generally left the local planetary government, which was really a proxy for the Hutt crime lords, largely free do do their thing.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I got the impression from Phantom Menace that the Hutts openly rule Tatooine in the Republic era. When Watto tries to renege on his bet with Qui-Gon, Qui-Gon threatens to take the dispute to the Hutts, which only makes sense if the actual justice system is made of Hutts. Also, during the race, Jabba puts in an appearance and everyone cheers, which makes more sense for a king or lord than a crime boss.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Something that always bothered me about the whole &#8220;Jedi are forbidden to love&#8221; thing: what could the order have actually done to Anakin as a punishment? It&#8217;s not like they can take his powers or his training away. Even kicking him out of the Jedi Order does nothing more than condemn him to live the life of the kept man of a beautiful, rich, and powerful woman.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>True, but I think Vergere is the only example of the technique in late Republic era. Most of the other examples are from the Dark Horse Tales Of The Jedi stuff or KOTOR (set a loooong time before the prequels). And Vergere has her&#8230;own issues, having been retconned due to editorial and authorial disputes.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The Jedi Order is a surrogate family. (Anakin is unusual in that he remembers his birth mother.) Expulsion from the Order amounts to expulsion from your family. It also means giving up your high social status; a Jedi outranks a Senator&#8217;s spouse, especially a spouse as politically inept as Anakin. Given Anakin&#8217;s exceptional power and ties to the Chancellor he&#8217;d probably still fight alongside his Jedi and clone friends (as Ahsoka does in Season 7), but the Jedi made their rules long before they knew they&#8217;d be soldiers.</p>
<p>Who does leave the Order? Ahsoka, after she feels the Order no longer welcomes her. Count Dooku, after he inherits that title (and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if his family had the clout to stay in touch with him during his time as a Jedi). Anakin, after his new father figure demands it. Ben, who thinks his master Luke tried to kill him. Luke, after he&#8217;s the only one left.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Even kicking him out of the Jedi Order does nothing more than condemn him to live the life of the kept man of a beautiful, rich, and powerful woman.</p></blockquote>
<p>If he wanted to live the life of the husband of a beautiful, rich, and powerful woman, he could have just quit the Jedi Order and married Padme. He didn&#8217;t because he liked the power and status he enjoyed as a Jedi. In fact his main griveance with the Jedi Order is that they wouldn&#8217;t raise him to the rank of master.</p>
<p>Even if the Jedi couldn&#8217;t take away his training and his connection to the Force, they could take away his legal sanction to use it offensively, which is something that Anakin clearly enjoys doing (e.g. the massacre of the Tusken Raiders, the summary execution of Count Dooku), while Obi Wan and Yoda pretend not to notice because they are fighting a war and he such a strong soldier.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>“From my perspective, the Jedi are evil!” the villain falsely said to his mentor who had a lifelong habit of deceiving socially vulnerable children and young adults and using his religion to literally hypnotize people.</p></blockquote>
<p>I read this five times looking for the Tom Swiftie. 🙂</p>
<p>There are definitely some valid perspectives to criticize the Jedi. (If I could rewrite the prequels, I&#8217;d build Anakin&#8217;s resentment over the Jedi saving him and leaving his mother and all the other slaves in place). </p>
<p>On the other hand, Anakin&#8217;s perspective (that Palpatine is better than the Jedi because Palpatine promises him that the dark arts will let him defeat death), is selfish and IMHO wrong.</p>
<p>Also, how did Obi-Wan deceive socially vulnerable children? (Lastly, hypnotizing is usually a preferable alternative to violence &#8211; if they used hypnotism for Lulz I blame the writers).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Also, how did Obi-Wan deceive socially vulnerable children? </p></blockquote>
<p>Luke wasn&#8217;t exactly a child, but he was still a young adult who has recently lost all his family when Obi Wan lied to him about his father and lied by omission about his sister in order to persuade him join him in a violent struggle that could have easily got him killed or turned to the Dark Side of the Force.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My sense is that in international treaties between two states, if one party breaches the treaty considerably, then the other effects become void or at least other state may choose to make void the other parts of the treaty, or at least the parts of the treaty that are closely tied to the other states commitment.<br />
Ie two countries both agree to permit citizens of the other to fish in their waters. One of the counties then revokes the access of the other&#8217;s citizens, then innocent country would be free to forbid the breaching country&#8217;s citizens access. </p>
<p>Is this correct?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Along the same lines as the alchemical exposition of &#8220;My Immortal&#8221;, I&#8217;m currently reading <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dion_Fortune" rel="nofollow ugc">Dion Fortune</a> (née Violet Mary Firth)&#8217;s &#8220;Psychic Self-Defence&#8221; for a bit of light reading, and it would seem that the members of the British occult community during the First World War were made of stern stuff 🙂</p>
<blockquote><p>It was in the early days of my interest in occultism, when I was still buying my experience by the expensive but effectual method of running my head into obstacles, I made the acquaintance of a woman who was interested in psychic matters. &#8230;At the time I knew her she was verging on a breakdown which was alleged to be due to overwork, and she was very anxious to get away from cities and back to nature. I was just leaving London to take up my residence at an occult college which was hidden away in the sandy fastnesses of the Hampshire barrens. In the innocence of my heart I suggested that she might come down there and help with the domestic duties. </p>
<p>&#8230; These nightmares continued, on and off for the next few days, to afflict different members of the community. They were vague and nebulous, and there was nothing we could pitch upon for diagnostic purposes, and we put it down to indigestion caused by the village baker&#8217;s version of war bread.</p>
<p>Then one day I had a quarrel with Miss L. She had conceived a &#8220;crush&#8221; for me; I have a constitutional repulsion for crushes and give them scant politeness, and she complained bitterly of my lack of responsiveness. What ever may be the rights and wrongs of the case, I had roused her resentment in good earnest. That night I was afflicted with the most violent nightmare I have ever had in my life, waking from sleep with the terrible sense of oppression on my chest, as if someone were holding me down, or lying upon me. I saw distinctly the head of Miss L., reduced to the size of an orange, floating in the air at the foot of my bed, and snapping its teeth at me. It was the most malignant thing I have ever seen.</p>
<p>Still not attaching any psychic significance to my experiences, and being firmly convinced that the local baker was responsible, I told no one of my dream, thinking it one of those things that are better kept to oneself; but when the members of the community came to talk matters over in the light of subsequent events, we found that two other people had had similar experiences.</p>
<p>&#8230;Next morning, however, the storm broke. Miss L. and I were peacefully at work in the kitchen when she suddenly caught up a carving-knife and started after me, as mad as a March hare. Fortunately for me I had in my hands a large saucepan full of freshly boiled greens, and I used this as a weapon of defence, and we danced round the kitchen table, slopping hot cabbage-water in all directions. We neither of us made a sound; I fended her off with the hot and sooty saucepan, and she slashed at me with an unpleasantly large carving-knife.</p>
<p>At a psychological moment in walked the head of the community. He took in the situation at a glance, and handled it by the tactful method of scolding us both impartially for making so much noise and telling us to get on with our work. Miss L. finished whatever she was doing with the carver, I dished up the cabbage, and the incident passed off quietly.</p>
<p>After lunch Miss L. experienced the reaction from her excitement and went to her room completely prostrated with exhaustion. I was somewhat perturbed. Although used to mental cases, and therefore not as disturbed by the recent fracas as anyone else might have been, I did not relish the prospect of being the housemate of a dangerous lunatic who was under no sort of control. The head of the community, however, said there was no cause for alarm, he would soon have the case in hand. He went up to the bath room, filled a soap-dish with water from the tap, made certain passes over it, and dipping his finger in the water, proceeded to draw a five-pointed star upon the threshold of Miss L.&#8217;s room.</p></blockquote>
<p>And this is only the third chapter, I haven&#8217;t gotten to the good parts yet! 😀</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Piling on with the Rosicrucians, Freemasons, occultists etc&#8230;.<br />
I recently learned from a new biography of Aleister Crowley that he invented the V for victory during WWII. He may have been the &#8220;world&#8217;s wickedest man&#8221; but he was also very much a British imperialist. He tried to get the powers that be to let him help with propaganda during WWI but (not surprisingly) they weren&#8217;t interested. He did some freelance double-ops anyway. During WWII he thought there needed to be something to counter the Nazi&#8217;s use of the swastika as a sigil, and came up with the V idea. He knew it would be tainted if anyone connected him with the idea, and so got someone at the BBC to propagate it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That was fucking amazing.</p>
<p>That said (note: not a speedrunner, have never played Wind Waker) I think that the part where they try to narrow the initial distribution based on how long speedruns take is&#8230;mostly unimportant?  I&#8217;d wager that even if you started with a fully uninformative prior over ~10M positions, say, you&#8217;d do well. As the video stated your posterior on the first board would be dead flat, sure, but again after even a few hits/misses we&#8217;d be able to restrict to a few dozen positions.  (And again, for the second board, we&#8217;d be start with a plenty-tight prior.)</p>
<p>About the only hard part here is your heatmap calculator needing to rapidly average over a much larger set of boards, but I claim that this is a tractable calculation.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Keep in mind that 10M ~ 2^23 and you only get 24 shots. Since misses give less than 1 bit of information, and you still need enough shots left over after you&#8217;ve determined your board to complete the game, you won&#8217;t have enough information to narrow it down unless you luck into early hits. The nonuniform prior from RNG tracking is needed to provide this missing information.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Wow, I think about this minigame periodically.</p>
<p>My general strategy was to hit it with diagonal lines to find the squid and hope to get lucky.</p>
<p>People have done amazing things to reverse-engineer the Pokemon RNGs such that they could figure out, within a few frames (24 per second) exactly when to do something to pop a shiny. Some later games had very tuneable RNGs and you could force lots of specific Pokemon stats.</p>

<p>I assumed the later gens were much less manipulable in such a manner.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ve not watched any SpaceX launches live before now.  Have they always had this high-density journalism-style non-stop <i>nattering</i>?  These people just cannot shut the fuck up, and a solid majority of what they&#8217;re saying isn&#8217;t needed at all.  There&#8217;s some things where they have a commentator telling me details I don&#8217;t know regarding the equipment, and that&#8217;s alright, but even there a lot of that talks over actual communication with the capsule.  But whoever this is that they have as their anchor&#8211;and I&#8217;m not kidding with that, if you told me she was slurped up from The View or something, it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me at all&#8211;keeps talking about how her heart is pounding, etc.  I&#8217;m not tuning in to hear about the emotional state of the commentators.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s just because they don&#8217;t show a bunch of it in highlight videos for watching later, since those focus on the last few minutes, and this will all go away as they get close to launch.</p>
<p>ETA: And whenever they cut to somebody like their commentator at Houston, they stop overlaying the countdown.  Holy hell, do any of you understand that I&#8217;m just watching you talk at a camera as something to do while I wait for that clock to tick down?!  And at that, there&#8217;s no reason whatsover to cut away from LC-39.  I can hear your voice just fine, and don&#8217;t care about your face.</p>
<p>ETA further:  OK, yeah, it apparently *is* just something they do up until about 10 minutes prior to launch.  This is much better, though the guy still needs to avoid talking over actual communications.  At least most of the explanations are also much more focused about what they&#8217;re doing and why.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Thanks viVI_IViv for the <a rel="nofollow"href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/05/27/open-thread-154-75/#comment-904156">comment</a>, untitled was a great read (I think I read it before, but it has been a while).</p>
<p>One thought on Scott Aaronson&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2091#comment-326664" rel="nofollow ugc">post #171</a>, though.</p>
<blockquote><p>I might react icily to the claim—for which I’ve seen not a shred of statistical evidence—that women are being kept out of science by the privileged, entitled culture of shy male nerds, which is worse than the culture of male doctors or male filmmakers or the males of any other profession.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree that people other than &#8220;shy male nerds&#8221; in the sciences are likely a far larger part of the problem, if the female representation in certain disciplines is indeed a problem caused by the actions or culture of some males. That said, if it is sensitive &#8220;shy male nerds&#8221; such as Scott Aaronson who are most drawn to these sciences, then wouldn&#8217;t it also be sensitive &#8220;shy female nerds&#8221; who are also drawn disproportionately to those sciences, and wouldn&#8217;t those &#8220;shy female nerds&#8221; have just as many overt sensitivity issues as the &#8220;shy male nerds&#8221;?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible those &#8220;shy female nerds&#8221; who avoid these sciences with a ten-foot pole avoid the disciplines where male doctors and male filmmakers congregate like the plague. And this avoidance probably isn&#8217;t the fault of those &#8220;shy male nerds&#8221;, but it would still be a hypersensitivity every bit as acute as that of the &#8220;shy male nerds&#8221;. A hypersensitivity that would be reinforced every time you get a James Damore who blames the representation on the inherent biology (parallel to &#8220;entitlement&#8221;) of &#8220;shy female nerds&#8221;, and would be especially reinforced when the not-so-shy non-nerds make television shows or movies about people who externally look like &#8220;shy male nerds&#8221; behaving sophomorically (from <i>The Nutty Professor</i> to <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM94aG35YiI" rel="nofollow ugc">SNL</a> to the <i>Big Bang Theory</i>), which have audiences who claim to be &#8220;shy male nerds&#8221; who claim to enjoy the show.</p>
<p>Just as &#8220;shy male nerds&#8221; are ill-served by sexual-harassment training meant to tackle rape-culture, aren&#8217;t these &#8220;shy female nerds&#8221; ill-served by discussions attributing representation and culture to inherent biology (or even formative experiences)?</p>
<p>I know someone must have made an observation like mine somewhere when Scott Aaronson&#8217;s comment came out, can anyone point me to the resulting discussion?</p>

<p>How does that make the lumping of &#8220;shy female nerds&#8221; into a general &#8220;woman&#8221; category any better?</p>
<blockquote><p>AFAIK, most “shy male nerds” think these shows are the nerd equivalent of blackface. They laugh at you, not laugh with you.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, I know and agree. It&#8217;s a sad fact that not all &#8220;nerds&#8221; are &#8220;shy nerds&#8221;.</p>
<p>But then you get Robert Frost&#8217;s Quora answer (unfortunately the most [I believe] viewed answer for &#8220;What do nerds think of The Big Bang Theory?&#8221;): <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.quora.com/What-do-nerds-think-of-The-Big-Bang-Theory?share=1" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.quora.com/What-do-nerds-think-of-The-Big-Bang-Theory?share=1</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The Big Bang Theory is about the subset of people that are both Geeks and Nerds. While the show has fans from across the spectrum, it has been my observation that the [Geek+Nerd] subset gets the show and loves it and individuals that are only [Geek] or only [Nerd] are more likely to object to the show. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>For me &#8211; it is the best sitcom since Seinfeld. I laugh out loud during every episode.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whereas Mira Kim&#8217;s less viewed answer is far, far better in all respects.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Honestly I feel like the Big Bang Theory gets a lot of undeserved hate and criticism.  Yes it does occasionally make some cheap low-effort jabs at nerds and nerd culture.</p>
<p>But the overall message of the show is that nerds are good people who deserve not just your respect and friendship, but the romantic love of relatively normal people as well.</p>
<p>By the end of the show, three of the four guys are married, and none of their wives are nerds (although Amy is a bit weird, in her own way).  And other than Howard having his occasional moments, none of them are really weird/creepy guys that hit on women too much or bully they out of the sciences.</p>
<p>The main takeaway is always &#8220;These are people, just like you, and you have far more in common with them than you might have differences.&#8221;</p>

<p><a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3-hOigoxHs" rel="nofollow ugc">I&#8217;m not sure about that</a><a>. They did some pretty creepy stuff, like looking up a girl&#8217;s skirt with remote cameras on RC cars. They definitely had creepy moments in a way a typical shy nerd guy would never do. It all gets played for laughs, but&#8230;eh.</p>

One of the recurring comedic themes of Big Bang Theory is that male nerds really are as creepy and misogynist as the worst radfem stereotypes of men, in part because they are sexually frustrated and in part because they just lack the social intelligence to understand that such behaviors are inappropriate, but it&#8217;s all played for laughs because they are too weak and effeminate to pose any real threat to women.</p>
<p>This plays directly into the hostile stereotype of the Nice Guy™ that Scott talks about in <a rel="nofollow"href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/31/radicalizing-the-romanceless/">Radicalizing the Romanceless</a> and is also at the heart of Aaronson&#8217;s comment #171 and the reaction it got from the Marcottes of the world: that awkward guy who is sad that he never gets the girl might look nice, but in reality his mind is as dirty as Howard&#8217;s or Raj&#8217;s, or as casually misogynistic as Sheldon&#8217;s, so it&#8217;s fine to belittle and even bully him.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m happy to see someone else defending Big Bang Theory. I&#8217;ve always enjoyed it. The characters may be over-exaggerated versions of real life nerds, but exaggeration is to be expected in any sitcom. The main cast and their shenanigans remind me of my own nerdy friend group in college. Good times, good times. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s also nice to see socially awkward nerds portrayed as the protagonists for once. The closest thing I saw to that, growing up with 90s TV shows, was the socially awkward nerd (usually an outcast) who was sometimes permitted to join the main group, but only if they dialed down the nerdiness.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s Sheldon, who is coded as on the autism spectrum. Using him as an example can be useful when trying to explain autistic peoples&#8217; experiences and thought patterns to NT people.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>In <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2091#comment-317233" rel="nofollow ugc">comment #92</a> Scott Aaronson goes on to state:</p>
<blockquote><p>MIT’s main concern is that it no longer wants any of this to happen under its auspices, given Lewin’s past use of the learning communities that form around his lectures to find targets.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Personally, I think it would’ve been fine for OCW to continue to host the lectures, after the world had been duly warned about Lewin’s behavior.</p></blockquote>
<p>This wouldn&#8217;t stop Lewin from using the OCW learning communities to find targets and harass them, it would merely make it more difficult and greatly increase the likelihood of nipping his harassment fairly early on (assuming he refrains from using a pseudonym). But he could still find targets, and find their contact info to harass them.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;ve got a <i>minor</i> form of the <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ones_Who_Walk_Away_from_Omelas" rel="nofollow ugc">Omelas scenario</a>, with Scott Aaronson stating that he would not be one of those who walk away from Omelas. (Hmm: If a child is to be tortured, is it not best that the maximum number of people benefit?)</p>
<p>(Note that I agree in general with a lot of what Scott Aaronson wrote in post #171. These are what I consider the important nitpick critiques.)</p>
<p>Edit:  Given <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2091#comment-317398" rel="nofollow ugc">comment #95</a>, this is a somewhat unfair attack on Scott Aaronson. But given other comments about the community (which can exist independent of OCW), I&#8217;ll leave it.</p>
<blockquote><p>My understanding is that OCW doesn’t have discussion boards, but that EdX does, and that those (along with other online discussion groups) were the problem.</p></blockquote>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>if it is sensitive “shy male nerds” such as Scott Aaronson who are most drawn to these sciences, then wouldn’t it also be sensitive “shy female nerds” who are also drawn disproportionately to those sciences, and wouldn’t those “shy female nerds” have just as many overt sensitivity issues as the “shy male nerds”?</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure I understand you quite right, but it&#8217;s not clear to me that you can just assume that female versions of the &#8220;shy male nerd&#8221;, with the same kind of shyness and the same sensitivity, even exist in appreciable numbers &#8211; and do the extent that they do exist, how do you know that a good percentage of the very much non-zero number of women in science aren&#8217;t them?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I was served a subpoena that included a request for “&#8230; any documents evidencing a financial agreement between you and so and so”. I am a non-party to the litigation &#8211; a divorce proceeding.</p>
<p>I have a document which is responsive. It is a google doc spreadsheet. I am the “owner” of this spreadsheet. </p>
<p>The issue I’m running into is, the person who issued the subpoena modified the spreadsheet after litigation began to support a fraudulent position. They are essentially using this subpoena to get me to submit falsified evidence to support their fraud.</p>
<p>My intent is to object to the subpoena in such a way as to maximally harm them in the eyes of the court. I’m happy to provide the documents, but his behavior has been consistently atrocious and he needs to be repeatedly hit with a stick, so to speak. I have chat records where they admit to systematically lying about financial issues, and will include those.</p>
<p>I feel like using a subpoena like this has to be illegal, over and above the fraud and falsifying evidence, but the only term I’ve found, “abuse of process”, doesn’t quite cover it.</p>
<p>I’m in Florida, so the basis for objecting to a subpoena is whether or not it’s “reasonable”.</p>
<p>Anybody have any suggestions for relevant legal sounding words?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Do you have the ability to pull up prior versions of the spreadsheet and provide those as well? If so, you could include those in any documents you produce. </p>
<p>You&#8217;re also free to talk to the attorney for the opposing party (not the bad actor who subpoenaed you, but the person you think they&#8217;re trying to harm through this conduct) and explain your view on the situation. Realistically, I expect the attorney for the other party in that case would be <i>happy</i> to work with you to maximize the impact of your document production. That attorney is also almost certain to have a better sense of the strategic actions that would increase the chance of consequences for the bad conduct of the party who subpoenaed you.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You need an attorney.  Do not assume you can outsmart the attorney issuing this subpoena without expert advice, and trying to be &#8220;cute&#8221; in what you send will either a) not work or b) run a severe risk of running afoul of some bizarre rule you didn&#8217;t know that could be destructive to: i) the party you like ii) your pocketbook, or iii) your freedom</p>
<p>If you can afford it, front the money for a quick consult with your own attorney.  If you absolutely cannot afford your own, I suppose you could try contacting the attorney opposing the one who sent you, but be advised: <i>they are not your attorney</i>, and their job is to get the best outcome for their client, and if that makes your life worse or costs you money, oh, well.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yeah, I&#8217;m going to investigate this option. I am also going to consult with a lawyer.</p>
<p>The wife in the divorce &#8211; who is my girlfriend &#8211; is currently representing herself pro-se. She has been consulting with a lawyer, who she has now decided to retain.</p>
<p>I do have access to the edit history &#8211; that&#8217;s how I know definitively that this guy edited it.</p>
<p>The more I think about it, the more it looks like this subpoena is ordering me to do something illegal: knowingly submit falsified evidence to the court. If I submit the doctored information without some kind of CYA maneuver, this would be identical to someone acting in bad faith trying to perpetrate fraud.</p>
<p>Not currently employed, but probably just need to bite the bullet and pay to figure out how to protect myself here.</p>
<p>Update: talked to a lawyer friend. They said hire a lawyer. I&#8217;m hiring a lawyer. They also said &#8220;as a rule, you can never contact the judge. that is true here.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>OK, it&#8217;s great to see that you&#8217;ve hired a lawyer, but just as a point of &#8220;how to ask questions&#8221;: you reeeeeally buried the lede by leaving out that bit about this being your girlfriend&#8217;s husband subpoenaing you.  If you had stated upfront, &#8220;Oh, BTW, I&#8217;m fucking one of the parties in this dispute,&#8221; my post would have just been, &#8220;LAWYER.  LAWYER.  LAWYER.  LAWYER.  LAWYER.  LAWYER.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure your attorney told you this, but just in case: don&#8217;t post about this here (or anywhere else on the internet) anymore.  It will only hurt you, and can&#8217;t possibly help, now that you have counsel.</p>
<p>Honestly, it&#8217;s more likely that the husband told his lawyer that he had this super-great evidence that his wife is hiding money, and made all these edits without his lawyer&#8217;s knowledge.  You can find plenty of stories of attorneys waylaid by clients lying to them or mangling evidence (before Popehat lost his mind, he was a great read for stuff like this&#8211;still is, if you can wade through the &#8220;lost his mind&#8221; tweets), and it&#8217;s likely that the ex-husband&#8217;s attorney is going to be super mad at his client.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s not always obvious how or under what circumstances you&#8217;re allowed to bring in particular evidence for or against this, so the husband&#8217;s lawyer may have been able to hide the evidence you had from the court with superior knowledge of process.  That&#8217;s why you need your own professional guidance.</p>
<p>Edit: I see that I misread you, in that you&#8217;re <i>going</i> to get an attorney, not that you already have one.  In that case, he&#8217;s going to tell you to stop posting here.  Take his advice in advance.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If the U.S. Civil War had started earlier or later than it did, how would the balance of power (and hence, likelihood of victory/defeat) have been different between the Union and Confederacy? </p>
<p>For example, consider that the Union&#8217;s more extensive railroad network gave it economic and military advantages during the Civil War. However, had the War occurred in the 1830s, this advantage would have been much smaller since both sides has far fewer railroads.<br />

<p>What window of time would have given the Confederates the highest odds of winning?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t believe machines played a critical role in any civil war battle.  The Gattling Gun was still relatively recent and in either case was never a game changer. Probably the biggest military innovation I can think of that would have mattered would be the minie-ball and mass produced rifling, which greatly extended the effective range of muskets and their propensity to shatter limbs and cause amputations.  But had the war started earlier, I&#8217;d still think you&#8217;d see generally the same tactics used, but perhaps to less deadly effect.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I sort of thought that&#8217;s why some of the civil war battles were so deadly.  Commanders hadn&#8217;t adapted to the new technology and were using older tactics with far deadlier results.  But i would be interested to know what doctrinally changed in the US between 1815 and 1860.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Basically, the earlier the better from the perspective of the South&#8211;both because the North is growing faster and industrializing, but (more importantly) the British hostility to slavery grows over time.  The British Navy keeping Southern ports open would probably have made it possible for them to win even in 1860.  (ETA) And anti-slavery sentiment was a very significant reason for Britain effectively siding with the North when their financial interests would have had them side with the South.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Also, earlier means the Egyptian cotton industry is smaller, and the British cannot so easily divorce their textile industry (significant fraction of British GDP in that era) from Southern cotton.</p>
<p>But too early would mean Britain is still smarting from their <strike>defeat</strike> insufficiently glorious victory in the War of 1812, looking for a bit of payback that might not be confined north of the Mason-Dixon line if e.g. New Orleans looks like easy pickings.</p>
<p>Maybe split the difference and go with 1838?  That also gives the Confederacy the Republic of Texas as a possible independent ally, the Union <i>doesn&#8217;t</i> get California etc, and Mexico is too busy fighting the French to cause serious trouble.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I would think the earlier the better. The north&#8217;s economic base was industrial whereas the south&#8217;s was agricultural. The further back you go the less industrialization there is and the more power that agricultural base represents. The north also grows in population much more than the south does in the first century of the United States. E.g. see <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_historical_population#1790%E2%80%931860,_census_data" rel="nofollow ugc">here</a>. Virginia was the biggest state in 1790, but only the 7th largest in 1860. Virginia&#8217;s population doubles in that time period, while New York&#8217;s increases by more than 10x. So I think the South&#8217;s best bet is to leave as soon after the Revolution as possible, but not so soon that they get squashed by the Brits.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Another advantage was that the North had the Midwest. The Union army was better fed, despite being larger, because they had more land devoted to food crops. It wasn&#8217;t industry vs. agriculture; it was industry AND agriculture vs. agriculture that becomes useless when you can&#8217;t export. So seceding before the Midwest was settled would have been helpful to the Southern cause.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, the easiest time to secede would probably have been before the 1789 Constitution strengthened the federal government.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>What will happen if all 3 million Hong Kongers who now qualify move to the UK?</p>
<p>How long would it take to build enough housing for them? For them to get jobs? What is the timescale at which having 3 million people move into a country with a population of 68 million is realistic?</p>
<p>I say you&#8217;d need at least 10 years if Hong Kongers don&#8217;t want their material circumstances to be massively affected. Sure, since they&#8217;re used to live in shoeboxes, they&#8217;ll do with smaller housing, but I&#8217;m pretty sure some of the housing that is legal in Hong Kong would be legal in the UK. Minimum sizes, all that. </p>
<p>And the issue is, Hong Kongers, being urbanites, will probably prefer the big cities, which have even more issues with building new housing.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t think it would take 10 years, unless all 3 million are trying to live specifically in London in which case it would be roughly N+3 years where N is the number of years it takes to improve the approval process for new units.  </p>
<p>As an intermediate stage there are probably a few hundred thousand empty hotel rooms in the UK right now that could be used as temporary lodging, and relocating a massive number of Hong Kongers could save the hospitality industry simultaneously.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Are you assuming the UK will be able to fix its housing regulation within 7 years?<br />
that&#8217;s optimistic.   </p>
<p>It might be instructive to look at parallels with the expulsion of the Ugandan Indians. A lot of them ended up in places like Coventry and Leicsester. From what I hear, there was a definite class divide in where they were settled.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I am saying if almost all the migrants from Hong Kong want to live in London then being able to build enough housing for them without major reforms will be a very long process and will take ~ 3 years after major reforms to satiate that level of demand.  If they spread out to a much greater extent then it would be less than 10 years, probably 4-5 without major reforms.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Where are you getting 3 million from? My impression is that what has been discussed so far (and may well happen, but is far from confirmed) is offering citizenship or at least residence rights to 300,000 holders of British National (Overseas) passports, not to Hong Kong citizens more generally, and one assumes that even if this offer is made not everyone entitled will take it up.</p>
<p>Personally I&#8217;m in favour of a much broader offer to Hong Kongers in general along the lines you appear to be suggesting, but as far as I can tell such a thing is not within the current Overton window in Britain, much less a <i>fait accompli</i>.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>HK migrants are more likely to form an invisible elite rather than a visible one.</p>
<p>Significant immigration from HK would likely help to  alleviate three major issues the UK is having.  </p>
<p>1.  Threats of lower property prices<br />
2.  Lower tax revenues<br />
3.  A struggling/dying hospitality industry</p>
<p>Australia managed to avoid a technical recession in 2008 by admitting a large number of wealthy immigrants, overall this could be a massive and obvious enough boom that the number of long term complainers would be low.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Baconbits</p>
<p>Lower property prices? If prices are falling in certain areas of the country it&#8217;s likely because there&#8217;s basically no &#8216;economy&#8217; and hence no reason to live there. If large numbers of people come to the UK, my default assumption is they will take the path of least resistance and move where the jobs are, i.e. the dense metros, which is where people are likely already competing for living space. </p>
<p>I can&#8217;t disagree about tax revenues and I&#8217;m unclear about what #3 refers to.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>While there certainly is a constituency for opposition to immigration <i>tout court</i>, it is much, much smaller than the constituency for Brexit (and indeed the constituency for more selective immigration controls). Even within the group who have strongly objected to immigration policy in recent decades, most care a lot about who exactly is immigrating. I think Hong Kong residents fleeing Chinese oppression will be viewed a lot more positively on multiple axes than the median immigrant.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You know the vote to leave was about sovereignty, which includes control of immigration, not immigration alone? Despite repeated attempts by the majority of the media to characterise people who voted to leave as anti-immigration (or old, or uneducated, or whatever), which is generally an attempt by people who wanted to remain to characterise the other side&#8217;s voters, ultimately the leave vote was such a broad coalition of everyone from outright racists to liberal believers in free movement from anywhere on the globe that you can&#8217;t take the referendum as a guide to attitudes about anything than the EU. Unless you want to believe the remain campaign were all a metropolitan elite determined to do away with national identity&#8230;</p>
<p>I say this as a pro-immigration leave voter, who has met more fellow leave voters that agree with this position than are opposed to it, and who would probably on most issues line up alongside the bulk of remain supporters.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Erm, you are aware that the issue there was a drive for political union was never popular in the UK? Do of course the UK blocked things: its government represented it&#8217;s people who were sceptical of the EU.</p>
<p>The comparator here might better be NATO, where the UK&#8221;s role has been much more positive. An alliance with defined scope and minimal mission creep is generally either to accept than one that however you look at it is taking increasing control over national affairs.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It will be interesting to see if there’s a spike in covid hospitalizations a few weeks after the riots. I’ve been wondering if being masked and outdoors is sufficient to prevent most transmission, as that would allow a lot of things to be back to normalish in nice weather, and this a great test of that because people are otherwise doing high-risk behaviors like yelling and crowding together in large gatherings. (In most photos I&#8217;ve seen most people are still wearing masks, and I&#8217;m aware of organizers specifically asking people to be masked, so I think mask compliance here is decent.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Isn&#8217;t rioting traditionally an occupation undertaken whilst wearing a mask anyway?</p>
<p>In all honesty I think the numbers involved are too small to have a detectable impact. If loads of people go out on non-riot activities and observe proper distancing 98% of the time, that&#8217;s probably still far more close contact than the small population of rioters can provide.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Re:Protests, Riots and the 3 day moratorium.</p>
<p>How are we going to approach discussions of the current situation as protests and riots have occurred across several cities now and don&#8217;t appear to be slowing.  Reports of violence and deaths are coming out (reports out of Oakland are that two federal officers were shot last night with one dying).  It seems difficult or impossible to discuss the events as they happen without referencing the worst outcomes and it is also unlikely that we are going to wait for 3 days after the situation de-escalates.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I read this <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/world/europe/rutte-dutch-netherlands.html" rel="nofollow ugc">great fluff piece</a> about the Netherlands prime minister in the New York Times, and now I want to know about this guy. he sounded great, but of course that&#8217;s just the impression the writer wanted to give. I&#8217;d love to hear from all the Dutch people we&#8217;ve had in SSC recently tell me all the rotten stuff about him. Or at least the truth.</p>
<p>You probably can&#8217;t get to the article because the New York Times paywalls it. Sorry about that, but I just wanted to explain where I got this from. I read this on hard copy.</p>
<p>And especially fun to read this because they included two Dutch phrases in the article! The Dutch really <i>are</i> into this. And I don&#8217;t think either have been on Aajpe&#8217;s extensive posts. I may have to go back to hard copy to find them.</p>

<p>Well yeah, or not worrying about keeping a politically crafted image is part of his politically crafted image. If there are articles like this about him in the Dutch press, it works out for him.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I actually kind of like Rutte as a prime minister. Sure, the guy is pathologically boring, but I think that is a good quality in a national leader.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s also the general consensus over here, at least inside my bubble. Most of the criticism I hear about Rutte is about him wanting us to be &#8220;Het braafste jongetje van de klas&#8221; (the most obedient boy in class) when it comes to international agreements, which I don&#8217;t really have a problem with. If anything, having a bias towards not defecting in prisoners dilemmas is a <i>good</i> thing.</p>
<p>Edit: By the way, the way the article claims his name is pronounced is weird. It&#8217;s closer to RUT-uh than ROOT-uh. The first syllable (sort of) rhymes with gut.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Wouldn&#8217;t that be a reasonable approximation with a US accent? My Dutch is pretty poor (and mostly practiced with Flemings) but I think your objection relates more to received pronunciation UK English (and the normal Dutch pronunciation of English which is often &#8216;better&#8217; than the actual English one). [ru:t]  seems a plausible pronunciation for US </p>

<p>Is it? To me the vowels in gut and root sound completely different, but I am Dutch so I would have the Dutch pronunciation of English that you mentioned.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think the confusion is that there are two distinct pronunciations of &#8220;root&#8221; in the US:  one rhymes with &#8220;foot&#8221;, and the other with &#8220;boot&#8221;.  Both are equally correct regional variations, and if you say the wrong one for the region you are in you will be correctly considered an outsider.  I think the &#8220;rhymes with foot&#8221; pronunciation is usually considered more rural and less cultured.  &#8220;Rhymes with boot&#8221; is more common and formal.  </p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t find a map showing where the different variants are most common, but here&#8217;s an thread talking about &#8220;rhymes with foot&#8221; as the Western pronunciation: <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.waywordradio.org/discussion/topics/western-pronunciation-of-root-and-roof/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.waywordradio.org/discussion/topics/western-pronunciation-of-root-and-roof/</a>.   </p>
<p>The Wikipedia article on North-Central American English (talking about upper Midwestern speech patterns) says &#8220;The words roof and root may be variously pronounced with either /ʊ/ or /u/; that is, with the vowel of foot or boot, respectively. This is highly variable, however, and these words are pronounced both ways in other parts of the country.&#8221; (<a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North-Central_American_English" rel="nofollow ugc">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North-Central_American_English</a>)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I grew up in Illinois and would use the &#8220;oo&#8221; sound from foot for both root and roof, not the &#8220;oo&#8221; sound from boot. Looking around a little bit though, I&#8217;m not seeing where that comes from, so I don&#8217;t know where I picked it up.<br />
As I&#8217;ve gotten older I&#8217;ve picked up the &#8220;boot&#8221; pronunciation for both, but now it just kind of switches back and forth.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Most nonfiction authors like making big statements about little subjects, or small statements about big subjects. I&#8217;m looking for those that make big statements about huge topics, and change your whole viewpoint on life.</p>
<p>A few examples to make my point clearer: Rene Girard, Carl Jung, Joseph Campbell (The Power of Myth), Yuval Noah Harari (Sapiens), Nassim Taleb (The Black Swan), Robert Greene, Michel Foucault, Matt Ridley, Jared Diamond, Freidrich Nietzsche, David Graeber (Debt: A 5,000 Year History), and Julian Jaynes (The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind).</p>
<p>These people have totally flipped my worldview, and I want to be amazed again. Do you have any recommendations for authors that make huge statements about grand topics?</p>
<p>(Note: I posted this question on the subreddit but am hoping for some more answers here. You never know when you will hit an obscure but standout book!)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I’m not sure about Julian Jaynes. He has a whole society with his name on it (<a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.julianjaynes.org/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.julianjaynes.org/</a>) which claims to have evidence supporting his theory. There have also been more recent books expounding upon it. If you know of any books that are an argument against The Bicameral Mind theory, then let me know.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Bicameral Mind is not the null hypothesis. It&#8217;s an extraordinary claim bordering on fantastical. He needs some extraordinary evidence to even get his theory into play, and it doesn&#8217;t seem like he has it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>On the subject of Jared Diamond &#8230;</p>
<p>We all face the problem of evaluating sources of information. One of the ways I do it is by finding somewhere that a source overlaps with something I know something about and judging it by that.</p>
<p>Diamond published an essay on saga period Iceland in the form of a review of several books on the subject. His central factual claim, which for all I know was correct, was that Iceland looked a lot like Norway but had a much more fragile ecology, with the result that settlers, treating it like Norway, largely destroyed it for agriculture or timber. </p>
<p>His theme, however, was an attack on the semi-anarchic political institutions of the Commonwealth. He doesn&#8217;t seem to notice that the two issues are unrelated. Nobody knew the relevant ecological facts, so things would have gone equally badly, assuming his account is correct, if Iceland had been under the Norwegian crown. </p>
<p>On one particular issue, related to the legal/political institutions, he makes an argument without noting that one of the books he is supposed to be reviewing makes precisely the opposite claim. And he lists, among the Icelandic failures, the successful pirate raids and abductions of 1627 without, as best I remember — I&#8217;m working off memory, since I don&#8217;t have a copy of the essay ready to hand — mentioning that this was more than three centuries after the end of the Commonwealth had left Iceland under the rule of the Norwegian (and then joint Norwegian-Danish) crown.</p>
<p>I concluded that what he wrote could not be trusted. </p>
<p>You should, of course, discount that judgement to take account of the fact that he was arguing for a conclusion I disagreed with. If sufficiently interested I expect you can find his essay somewhere online and see if I have misrepresented it.</p>
<p>I apply the same tactic in other contexts, including here. Prussian recently pointed me at a forceful and persuasive post of his having to do with the dangers of Islam, in particular Islamic immigration. I know very little about the situation of Muslim immigrants to Europe but a good deal about Islamic law and history, so I have been pressing him on things he said in his post about that in order to get some measure of how much I should rely on what he says on the subjects I don&#8217;t know much about.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The Paradox of Choice by Barry Schwartz changed the way I think about a lot of things. It is admittedly not as far-reaching as your &#8220;big statements about huge topics,&#8221; but years after reading it I still find myself frequently thinking about some of its claims &#8211; it very convincingly argues that increased choice can make a person worse-off, which has massive implications for modern society and technology.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>These people have totally flipped my worldview, and I want to be amazed again. Do you have any recommendations for authors that make huge statements about grand topics?</p></blockquote>
<p>So, circa the early 1920s, the Western reading public commonly considered the most mind-blowing author after Einstein to be Oswald Spengler, for his two-volume history <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decline_of_the_West" rel="nofollow ugc">The Decline of the West</a>. The Decline challenged the Whig model shared by liberals and Marxists in favor of what he called &#8220;the Copernican model of history&#8221; where &#8220;we&#8221; are not the center of everything. Instead of history being a series of epochs leading up to the present generation of Western Men and an imagined future better by their standards, past cultures are re-framed as having been born and organically developing their potential entirely for their own sakes according to incommensurate ideals before dying of old age. Each of these cultures (Ancient Mesopotamian, A. Egyptian, Mesoamerican, Hindu, Chinese, Hellenic, &#8220;Magian&#8221; and Western) is described as an independent unit inspired by a belief system incomprehensible to others that inspired its own politics, arts and science. Yes, science: Spengler flirts with being the first postmodernist, though he doesn&#8217;t really go as far as saying it&#8217;s not objectively true, but just truth claims like it&#8217;s only Western Man&#8217;s longing for infinite space that makes an infinite universe and the idea of developing starships interesting (and previously inspired Gothic cathedral architecture: our stuff is all conceptually connected and ignores other cultures&#8217;s stuff, which in turn is all deeply connected within a given &#8220;organism&#8221;). He shows that each of these cultures started with many polities and turned into a &#8220;universal state&#8221;, which could have an &#8220;Augustan Age&#8221; <i>flourit</i> but then achieved a fixed form where farmers, craftsmen, and ossified elites would never do anything new, a phase that lasts about 400 years before losing even the old-age vigor that lets it survive rebellions or steppe invaders.<br />
Spengler&#8217;s big claims had such a wide scope that nobody&#8217;s sure how much one should apply the Gell-Mann amnesia heuristic to him. The more popular line of criticism was to simply denounce Spengler as a fatalist who denied that we had the free will to keep progressing forever or ruin our civilization ahead of schedule.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I feel like I didn&#8217;t elucidate this enough, so here&#8217;s a light sampling of the sort of questions <i>The Decline of the West</i> raises:</p>
<p>Is Western culture changing so fast (circa 1922) because other cultures are just somehow less dynamic? (he says no, let me clarify when in the past their belief systems, politics, and art were in constant flux)<br />
Is the reason 16th century European Christians who rejected Papal authority came up with a wide array of new theologies rather than go engage with the Eastern Orthodox who agreed about that because their minds were in a Western bubble that needed to experiment with its own potential, while the EO were incomprehensibly <i>Eastern</i>?<br />
Does a Western atheist have the same worldview as, eg, an Indian atheist, or is it thoroughly shaped by the Christianity he doesn&#8217;t believe in?<br />
Why did our culture advance some arts, like music, so much while our artists&#8217; big idea of how to make great statues was &#8220;just copy the Greeks&#8221;?<br />
Why the heck does Spengler say &#8220;Magian civilization&#8221; (monotheistic Middle Eastern) was in its hazy heroic legendary period until the Sassanids and their contemporary Roman Emperors? The Achaemenids were literate Zoroastrians! (read the Persian national epic <i>Shahnama</i> where Darius III and Alexander are legendary heroes and Darius I don&#8217;t real and find out)<br />
If different groups have different mindsets, does this have anything to do with biological race? (Spengler says something like &#8220;No: go find the set of all humans whose male children daydream about being knights. That&#8217;s a Western socially constructed experience.&#8221;)</p>
<p>It would be naive to just endorse his truth claims, but they&#8217;re huge interesting ones to evaluate.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>René Girard is the last guy to do this for me.</p>
<p>Read <i>Deceit, Desire, and the Novel</i> if you&#8217;ve read some Cervantes/Stendhal/Flaubert/Proust/Dostoevsky. The concept of &#8220;triangular desire&#8221; was a framework that crystallized a ton of thoughts I had regarding worldly desire, virtue, restraint, and the nature of narrative itself. </p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t read it, but I&#8217;ve heard <i>Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World</i> is his magnum opus. </p>
<p>Also, Tyler Cowen calls these types of books &#8220;quake reads&#8221;. His partial list <a rel="nofollow"href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/11/view-quake-read.html" rel="nofollow ugc">here</a> also endorses Girard.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Jacques Barzun, <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Dawn_to_Decadence" rel="nofollow ugc">From Dawn to Decadence</a>.  Came out in 2000 and it&#8217;s a big, fun read!  (At least I found it so, I honestly laughed in places at the more Puddleglum the Marshwiggle moments).  I didn&#8217;t agree with everything he was saying, particularly the conclusions he was drawing, but if he had lived to revise it for our current times (he died in 2012 at the age of 104, so well done Jacques) I might be more in agreement with his general take.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It was funny watching Barzun cover Western history from 1500-2000, starting with bold type headers for obviously correct major figures like <b>Martin Luther</b> and <b>Rabelais</b>, then as he gets closer to his own lifetime and consensus of who the most important non-politician figures were breaks down, we get <b>Dorothy Sayers</b> as possibly the most important person of her time.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Well, he was a fan of detective stories!</p>
<p>It seems to me that any big-history book like your Spengler or Deiseach&#8217;s Barzun qualifies—provided it was reasonably convincing, of course. Turchin or James C. Scott could be placed here, too, to take recent SSC reads.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>[Time to emerge from the shadows&#8230;again. My first version of this was lost.]</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe Dorothy L Sayers has had that much discussion on SSC, so I apologise if this is as gauche and clumsy as &#8220;Well, old boy, I-think-you&#8217;ll-find that CS Lewis wrote far more than Narnia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anyway, while Sayers was clearly no Martin Luther, she had her fingers in numerous pies. I think she can be placed in a fairly advanced weight class from her writing in both high and popular culture. </p>
<p>The Lord Peter Wimsey books are perhaps her best known work, and I don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;ve ever been out of print. They have been adapted for radio and television. </p>
<p>Sayers worked in advertising in her early life; you are perhaps familiar with one of her creations &#8211; the Guinness Toucan. Miss Meteyard in <i>Murder must Advertise</i> is sometimes held to be a loose self-portrait.</p>
<p>She went on to write plays; her first being <i>The Zeal of thy House</i>. This was written for the Canterbury Festival (same as TS Eliot&#8217;s <i>Murder in the Cathedral</i>) and is about the architect of Canterbury Cathedral and the nature of work. </p>
<p>More famous, however, may be her work for radio. She wrote a play cycle in 1941 called <i>The Man born to be King</i>, about the life of Jesus. This was very popular at the time of its broadcast on the BBC and controversial (it was accused of having caused the Fall of Singapore) for its use of modern language. It was repeated and remade in Sayers&#8217;s own lifetime. I believe it was broadcast in the colonies and on the World Service; I do not know if it was broadcast in Ireland or the US. BBC Radio 4 Extra (formerly Radio 7) repeated it in the 21st century &#8211; though it was a few years back.</p>
<p>Sayers also wrote essays, some of which have been collected in <i>Unpopular Opinions</i> (1946) and <i>Creed of Chaos?</i> (1947). These include theological essays such as the titular (and redoubtable) &#8216;Creed or Chaos?&#8217;, &#8216;The Dogma is the Drama&#8217; and &#8216;A Vote of Thanks to Cyrus&#8217;. Political essays include &#8216;Are Women Human?&#8217; (1938), (Which tells us why men&#8217;s braces are hideous and indecent) and &#8216;They Tried to be Good&#8217; (1943). Critical essays include a discussion of Aristotle on Detective Fiction and why Dr Watson&#8217;s middle name is Hamish.</p>
<p>Her stand-out long-form non-fiction work is <i>The Mind of the Maker</i> (1941), which discusses the process of creation and the Holy Trinity.</p>
<p>In later life, she would turn her hand to translation, translating (and commenting on) Dante&#8217;s <i>Divine Comedy</i> and <i>The Song of Roland</i> for Penguin Books*. I believe both translations are still in use. </p>
<p>Her translation of Dante retains the rhyme scheme from the Italian. Hence Canto Three begins as follows: <br />
<b>Through me the road to the city of desolation,<br />
Through me the road to sorrows diuturnal,<br />
Through me the road among the lost creation.</p>
<p>Justice moved my great maker; God Eternal<br />
Wrought me: the power and the unsearchably<br />
High wisdom, and the primal love supernal.</p>
<p>Nothing ere I was made was made to be<br />
Save things eterne, and I eterne abide;<br />
Lay down all hope, you that go in by me.</b><br />
(Bold in the original; Cf. <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Divine_Comedy_(Longfellow_1867)/Volume_1/Canto_3" rel="nofollow ugc">Longfellow</a>)</p>
<p>Apparently Umberto Eco approved. </p>
<p>***<br />
So what is all this to say? [EDIT: I&#8217;ve not read Barzun, and don&#8217;t know what he says. I may have to.] Well, if someone were to say to me that Dorothy L Sayers was the greatest mind of the twentieth century, I should be surprised and not think it quite write.<br />
But if someone were to say to me that &#8220;[Respected public intellectual] has named Dorothy L Sayers as her choice on a television programme called The Greatest Minds of the Twentieth Century&#8221;, I would say &#8220;Yes, I can see why she would do so.&#8221;.</p>
<p>***<br />
Incidentally, <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp03987/dorothy-sayers" rel="nofollow ugc">The National Portrait Gallery</a> has a number of pictures of Sayers. I&#8217;m very fond of the oil painting, but there are also a few pictures of her feeding porcupines. </p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ve been reading the Wimsey books this past year (I&#8217;m in the middle of <i>Busman&#8217;s Honeymoon</i> right now) and was just reading <i>The Mind of the Maker</i>. You&#8217;re forgetting a couple of neat anecdotes. First, she&#8217;s credited with inventing the slogan &#8220;It pays to advertise!&#8221; Second, her detective fiction was regarded at the time as the most literary of the Golden Age writers; even reviewers who trashed her books, like Edmund Wilson, said as much.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Eh, I feel like those kind of apparently big statements either have less influence than we think, or are &#8220;broken clock right twice a day&#8221; situations, because who has actually leveraged those statements to big benefit?

<p>True big statements about huge topics become self-evident background noise, and if I don&#8217;t already know about the people who said them, they didn&#8217;t do much with them.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I worry that OP is selecting for &#8220;insight porn,&#8221; a common enough temptation for people like us. It super-stimulates parts of your brain to trick you into thinking you&#8217;re getting insights, while frustrating the ultimate purpose.</p>
<p>What works would be &#8220;insight sex&#8221; instead?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ll be a bit more optimistic and say that what we have here is higher than average capability of changing one&#8217;s mind. Sure, insight porn is a problem, one I&#8217;m well aware of, but it can also be that one book can cause real, lasting progress. I have quite a few examples. Nassim Taleb&#8217;s Black Swan was momentous for me &#8211; in great part because of the context and timing, but still, the effect was real. I suspect btw that most such books have subjective effects. I found Sapiens to be good but utterly unmemorable, probably because I was already familiar with most concepts. I similarly find Jared Diamond on my personal list simply because it happened to introduce me to those concepts first, even though I think Sapiens is probably the objectively better book.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Too late to edit my comment, and have time to look through my library. This makes me realize how many unread books have piled up&#8230; I need a holiday. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty hard to point any one book since it seems like everything they do fits your profile, so I&#8217;m just going to name drop: Roy F. Baumeister for psychology and Herbert Simon for&#8230; uh, everything. </p>
<p>Keith Stanovich &#8211; Robot&#8217;s Rebellion. Think of it of a followup to Selfish Gene. Updated and, if I remember well, better rounded.</p>
<p>Shapiro and Varian &#8211; Information Rules. Economics book &#8211; best introductory text I ever found in information economy. </p>
<p>On Jared Diamond &#8211; make sure you check Ian Morris&#8217;s Why the West Rules. It&#8217;s pretty much a sequel to Guns, Germs and Steel (he says as much in the first chapter, I think). The surprising thing is how well it succeeds.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Surprised <i>Elephant in the Brain</i> by Robin Hanson wasn&#8217;t mentioned yet. It&#8217;s probably <i>the</i> best and most worldview-changing non-fiction book I&#8217;ve ever read (not counting the Sequences because I&#8217;ve read them before it was a book).</p>
<p>Also Scott reviewed <a rel="nofollow"href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05/book-review-surfing-uncertainty/">Surfing Uncertainty</a> so you&#8217;re probably aware of it, but in case you&#8217;re not it&#8217;s also great and fits your description nicely.</p>

<p>If I totally run out of reading matter during the lockdown, I&#8217;ll see about figuring out how to access the library&#8217;s e-books. If I&#8217;m really lucky, it&#8217;ll be possible to read them on my elderly black and white kindle. (Reading on a computer monitor or tablet is tiring, and I do more than enough of that ;-()</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p> I _don’t_ want to buy books based on whether someone I don’t know liked them</p></blockquote>
<p>Speaking of big life changes. What Black Swan did for me at the tender age of 27 was to hit me on the head, HARD, with the idea that there are good books out there that are well worth reading. The first major decision I took after that was to never ever judge a book through its price, and only by my willingness to put in the time to read it. That was well before I could afford to do so, btw. It was also probably the best decision I ever made.</p>
<p>This is a good time to say that recommendations here are pretty damn good, both fiction and non fiction. I&#8217;m currently on volume 17 of the Foreigner series.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>As we seem to enjoy Diamond, Morris, and Turchin, I&#8217;ll submit Marvin Harris&#8217; <i><a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60656.Cannibals_and_Kings" rel="nofollow ugc">Cannibals and Kings</a></i>, an &#8220;ecological&#8221; interpretation of the evolution of human cultures (i.e. one that ultimately traces it to the way populations capture energy from the environment). Admittedly it&#8217;s a bit old (1977), but it scratches much the same itches as <i>Guns, Germs, and Disease</i> (the different availability of domestic animals in the Old and New World is a key point in both, for example).<br />
Harris&#8217; energy-and-populations interpretation covers the Mesolithic and Neolithic revolutions, tribal demographics, infanticide, gender hierarchies, marriage customs, internal and external warfare, the origin of agriculture, the rise of states, human sacrifice, cannibalism, food taboos (in particular pigs in the Near East and cows in India), Axial Age religions, dynastic cycles, and the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>I also heartily second <i>The Selfish Gene</i> and <i>Maps of Time</i>.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>So I just don&#8217;t get the motivation of your character. He wants to review something&#8230; but only movie or play scripts? Why would he limit himself to that instead of also including the obviously more popular books into his list of things he&#8217;s willing to review? It&#8217;s just not clear and it leaves the audience really confused as to what his overall deal is. </p>
<p>As for the dialog, it starts out pretty good, but the ending is kind of too staccato. After the long sentence before it, the relative sharpness of &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it for free.&#8221; is a bit jarring. Maybe have him say, &#8220;Does anyone need any help? I&#8217;ll do it for free.&#8221; and keep it as one flowing idea.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I have been reading <i><a rel="nofollow"href="https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow ugc">A Practical Guide to Evil</a></i>, a web serial that someone here recommended. While it has some faults, it&#8217;s on the whole entertaining and I am currently on Chapter 56.</p>
<p>I am struck, however, by the contrast between the implied cultural views and implied political views. Both homosexuality and bisexuality are entirely taken for granted — the protagonist is casually bisexual, several other major characters homosexual. Characters complain about racism towards orcs, although orcs are not  race of humans  but a different species, strikingly different from humans both physically and behaviorally — among other things they are cannibals — at least as different as the most rabid racist believes blacks are from whites. Pretty clearly the author and his intended audience are modern progressives.</p>
<p>The political theme, however, is that villains are sometimes the good guys, that someone who does horrible things, kills thousands of innocent people, in order to get the power needed to do good things is behaving in a correct, indeed admirable, way. </p>
<p>Which makes me wonder if it has occurred to any of them that the clearest recent real-world example of such a person is Augusto Pinochet, not someone progressives generally approve of. Chile was much more prosperous when he left power than when he took power, and the usual charge against him is that he got and held power by murdering a lot of innocent people.</p>

<p>I just started watching based on this thread.  The possible economics seems to start in the third episode, hitting it&#8217;s stride in the fourth.  It seems like some currency devaluation scheme/Gresham&#8217;s Law thing is a major plot arc, but I&#8217;ve not watched beyond the fourth episode to see where it goes, or if it&#8217;s actually plausible economics vs. some superficial Hollywood nonsense.</p>
<p>Edit: This is a bit of a weird observation, and it&#8217;s been a while since I read your book so maybe I&#8217;m a little off-base, but I find similarities to your own Salamander after watching the 5th episode.  The center of this episode is a complicated financial transaction to get out of the kidnapping that occurred in the last episode, where I find the characters just a bit <i>too</i> rational and willing to deal.  I was thinking while watching this go down, &#8220;The merchant could agree to this proposal, sure, but he could also just murder the protagonist, who&#8217;s sitting alone in a room surrounded by his men, and save himself the trouble.&#8221;  It&#8217;s not so inexplicable as to be a plot hole&#8211;murder can cause as many problems as it solves, after all&#8211;but they haven&#8217;t given enough backstory for the merchant for the audience to know that he won&#8217;t take the easy (murdery) way out.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ve watched the show, and my recollection is that it does a lot of orbiting <i>around</i> economic issues, but it doesn&#8217;t really try to explain economics in any depth.</p>
<p>Like, one of the main characters is a travelling merchant.  A number of episodes involve him trying to cut favorable deals via arbitrage, or getting caught up in currency manipulation schemes, or trying to get his Ye Olde Travelinge Merchante Guilde to keep working with him even though he&#8217;s flagrantly travelling around the countryside with an attractive woman who he is not married to and thereby inviting public scandal.</p>
<p>But if you don&#8217;t already know something about coin debasement, you&#8217;re not going to get an understanding of it by watching the show.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s a good assessment.  The &#8220;currency debasement&#8221; arc turned out to be a bit smaller than I thought it would, so I finished it last night.</p>
<p>If after seeing the first two or maybe three episodes, you go &#8220;Ehh, I don&#8217;t care what happens to these people,&#8221; I don&#8217;t think anybody should feel obligated to stick around.  I&#8217;m going to at least finish the first season, which is free, and see if there&#8217;s other Funimation shows I&#8217;d be interested in watching to make an account worthwhile, as unless there&#8217;s a sharp decrease in quality I&#8217;d like to continue.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You shouldn&#8217;t need to create an account or pay anything to watch the subtitled episodes. The website deceptively tries to make you click through to dubbed episodes, so make sure to specify original JP language in one of the menu options.<br />
(I&#8217;ve also used NoScript to watch episodes that should be paywalled, which also gets rid of ads. Though sometimes it causes the video player interface to lose some features.)</p>
<p>But Spice and Wolf was originally a series of light novels, so you could try reading those instead of watching the show.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t think Pinochet fits this definition. </p>
<p>To get the &#8220;did evil for good&#8221; historical perspective all of your evils need to somehow have directly contributed to the eventual goodness you brought about OR the net result needs to be so good that everyone kind of forgets about your evil. Pinochet fails this test, imo, because his benefit of better-than-average economic growth didn&#8217;t really match up against the whole mass murder and torture aspects of his reign. </p>
<p>A better example, I think, would be Attaturk. No one talks about the great Fire of Smyrna because it seems like history has decided that,on the whole, revamping the vestiges of the ottoman empire into a modern state was good enough to cover up a bit a genocide.</p>

<p>But it is extremely hard to know what the counter-factuals would have been if Allende had stayed on. It&#8217;s possible that he would have ruled much like Chavez, in which case to me it is clear that Pinochet was an improvement. But maybe he would have been more like the left wing governments of France and Italy in those days, which had some bad policies, but didn&#8217;t prevent these countries from becoming strong market economies today.</p>

<blockquote><p>Actually Allende only got 36.3%, but above everyone else. That was one of the issues against him I believe.</p></blockquote>
<p>Good catch. Not getting a majority, he could only become President by the consent of Congress.<br />
The idea that democratic elections give a ruler so elected the authority to kill or starve citizens (or strip certain people of citizenship and then&#8230; etc.) is a conundrum in mainstream political philosophy going back to Rousseau. And there&#8217;s a blatant double standard with the Allende-Pinochet case vs. the <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_1933_German_federal_election" rel="nofollow ugc">1933 German elections.</a> No one but the tiny number of Neo-Nazis would say a 43.9% plurality gave the National Socialist government the authority to expropriate so much as a mark of Outgroup property or throw anyone in their gulag equivalents (concentration camps in the then-existing meaning).</p>

<p>Allende said his platform was to dismantle capitalism on the Cuban model. I don&#8217;t have sources off the top of my head for what the Cuban Revolution did to food production, but we can predict the probability of Allende putting people in gulags from A) the general data set of Marxist-Leninist states and B) his cited model had Soviet-style concentration camps <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.victimsofcommunism.org/witnessblog/2018/3/23/five-reasons-why-che-guevara-is-not-cool" rel="nofollow ugc">run by Che Guevara.</a></p>

Why would we need to &#8220;predict the probability&#8221; in that way when we could just look at what he did during his 3 years in power? But, grant for the sake of argument that Allende about to suddenly set up a load of labour camps (again, I&#8217;m not aware of any evidence for this). Why do you think that would have been worse than Pinochet&#8217;s regime? Obviously being in a labour camp for a few years (the UMAPs were only around for three) is bad, but it is much less bad than being tortured. In total, 35,000 people were put in labour camps in Cuba, in comparison Pinochet is estimated to have tortured around 40,000.</p>

<p>Because unlike unlike pinochet&#8217;s, allende&#8217;s economic policies would have only produced disaster, so you&#8217;d have gotten tyranny and poverty.  and each would have fed on the other, like it is in venezuela today.  </p>

<p>First, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s obviously true.   Second, cuba is the best cast for this sort of thing.  It was the least bad socialist revolution, assuming it would only be as bad as cuba and not modern venezuela is optimistic.</p>

<p>Source? As far as I know the main thing he did were nationalising copper and coal. Unless you think the UK in the 70s (with British Coal and British Steel), or indeed Pinochet&#8217;s dictatorship (where copper was still nationalised) was basically Venezuela, I don&#8217;t know what your argument is.</p>

<p>real wages fell by ~3/4, among other things, with precipitous declines in GDP and hyperinflation.  the land re-distribution programs were starting, and Castro was touring the country and speaking well of what he saw.    </p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t venezuela, but british post-war economic policy was terrible.  In 1950, the UK was richer than France and Germany and most of the other western european countries.

<p>There&#8217;s an awful lot I&#8217;d endure rather than lose a few years of my life, my career, and presumably most of my possessions.  Maybe not that particular torture, but I doubt that was done to all 40,000 people.  I&#8217;m quite certain that I&#8217;d rather spend a couple months in a cell than a couple years in a camp.</p>

<p>Tokugawa Ieyasu is a better example? He didn&#8217;t start the fight, didn&#8217;t even properly dominate it (that would be Nobunaga) but he definitely ended it, for like three centuries. </p>
<p>Anyways, my first though went to South Korea&#8217;s Park Chung-hee. Modern ruthless dictator, but managed to put the country on a solid upward trajectory.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>He tortured tens of thousands of people. Call me excessively deontological but I struggle to say that someone who ordered people to be &#8220;raped and sexually assaulted with trained dogs and with live rats&#8221; had a &#8220;pretty good record&#8221;. And that&#8217;s granting that Chile&#8217;s performance under his dictatorship was actually impressive, which I don&#8217;t see much evidence for. Chile&#8217;s wealth relative to the rest of Latin America didn&#8217;t change much from 1973 to 1990. The fact that it increased a lot *after* he left seems like a point against him, not one in his favour.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;Pretty good record for a tyrant&#8221;</p>
<p>Pinochet arranged for a stable transition to democratic government and his economic policies didn&#8217;t simply vanish when he left office.  the economy started growing far faster than the surrounding countries in the late 70s, there&#8217;s a brief recession in 82-3, and then growth resumes thereafter.  It took a while to get past the richer countries nearby, but there&#8217;s no discontinuity around 1990, previous trends continued.</p>

I hardly think Pinochet can take credit for that.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yugoslavia was the least socialist, but my impression is that Tito did a lot of killing in the civil war that ended with him in power, so he still fits. Indeed, he fits the pattern — tyrant who did bad things to produce good consequences — better as a result of establishing a relatively decentralized version of socialism. And he also looks better after we have seen the consequences when the breakup of Yugoslavia unleashed ethnic conflicts that he had been successfully keeping down. </p>
<p>So I think he is a plausible candidate.</p>

If we set the economic dimension to free market, and it&#8217;s already clear that both authoritarian and democratic systems can potentially work, whatever remains and is left-leaning in China/Yugoslavia is another potential dimension on which human society can slide and still thrive. How would you describe this dimension? How is China left of early South Korea, or Yugoslavia left of Chile?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You&#8217;d probably be wigged out by Wuxia novels. They go a step further than normal anti-hero or &#8220;end-justify-the-means&#8221; villains who are not quite evil if you look at it from a utility perspective.</p>
<p>As a for-instance, it&#8217;s not at all unusual for a main character to kill somebody or massacre a group/village/planet of sentient beings, often humans or human-acting humanoids because they have something they want, usually something that helps them surmount a minor difficulty in their training. These aren&#8217;t always/usually people they dislike; sometimes they just need to kill 10000 people to get a special prize.</p>
<p>If the main character wants to give somebody shit/disrespect them/fuck with them, it&#8217;s a fun display of his power and the other guy should deal; if the other guy doesn&#8217;t take it, it&#8217;s OK to kill him. If somebody disrespects the main character, it&#8217;s either OK to kill him or the main character can&#8217;t kill him currently, and will wait until he&#8217;s strong enough to. The only exception to this is if someone is vastly stronger than the main character in a way where he&#8217;s not going to catch up for a long time &#8211; then it&#8217;s only right that the stronger party is mistreating him; it&#8217;s natural.</p>
<p>So you end up with a guy who at least to some extent is hypersensitive to disrespect who demands active shows of respect but considers it good any time he can disrespect or lord over anyone who isn&#8217;t a close friend, and will often kill if one or the other is against his preference. He considers often people who steal from him scum, but steals/murders for gain pretty often &#8211; and is still considered by others to be a moral straight-shooter. It&#8217;s a situation where if there&#8217;s a local tyrant who abuses everyone he doesn&#8217;t like, the main character will train very diligently to depose him <i>so that he can be the local tyrant and abuse everyone he doesn&#8217;t like.</i></p>

<p>Wait, what? I thought I knew the genre: I have a nice illustrated translation of <i>Water Margin</i> and have read a few of the 20th century classics like any Louis Cha* novel that gets translated, and was under the impression that going to other planets was outside the scope of the <i>wuxia</i> genre.</p>
<p>*AKA Jin Yong, the <i>less </i> English Chinese name being his pen name. It&#8217;s a Hong Kong thing.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>So you end up with a guy who at least to some extent is hypersensitive to disrespect who demands active shows of respect but considers it good any time he can disrespect or lord over anyone who isn’t a close friend, and will often kill if one or the other is against his preference.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is the same energy motivating the stand-off between Achilles and Agamemnon at the start of the <i>Iliad</i>: this is an honour society, where social grades of distinction are very carefully and minutely calibrated, and things like &#8216;refusing a toast at a banquet&#8217; will kick off a clan feud.  To an outside view, this is a trivial and even meaningless thing to fight over, but within the culture it has to do with codes of behaviour that describe and delimit social roles and all that goes along with those, and it very much matters who is seen as the social superior or inferior.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re not really fighting over a slavegirl, they&#8217;re fighting over status, leadership, and their places within the society that they belong to, where reputation is all and whoever backs down first in this dispute will lose face (to borrow the Chinese concept) which will in turn have a <i>huge</i> effect on their rank, how they are treated, and what other people will now think they can get away with doing in relation to them.  It&#8217;s politics as much as anything else (because in this culture, the personal is the political) and will have ripple effects outside the personal relationships: if Achilles backs down, that puts him (and by extension) his forces under the hegemony of Agamemnon rather than being there on equal terms as one of the commanders where Agamemnon is &#8220;first among equals&#8221;, and even perhaps extending to the rule of his home city (as his father&#8217;s heir).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not clear to me why you think there is a contrast in views here. Modern &#8220;progressive&#8221; social viewpoints on hot-button issues like sexuality and racism, combined with ends-justify-the-means views of violence and destruction, seem pretty common these days.

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;d bet you&#8217;d be wrong about the pronouns. The set of people who are concerned by pronouns and riot over police violence is probably a very small portion of the pronoun-concerned population or the pool of rioters. This seems to be a view that all your (preumably) political opponents are an amorphous mass rather than a diverse group with different and non-intersecting views.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Well, first off, this feels like a contentless dunk &#8211; &#8220;This book is progressive in some ways, but reactionary in others, and we all know that people are only ever one or the other.&#8221;  But I do think there&#8217;s some interesting themes to talk about and it gives me an excuse to gush about this story, so I&#8217;ll leave your last paragraph aside and talk theme (Spoilers, obviously):</p>
<p>I think the central theme isn&#8217;t simply &#8220;Good guys sometimes have to do terrible things to gain power.&#8221;  After all, the Lone Swordsman did a lot of terrible things in the name of freeing Callow, and Catherine stomped on his head for doing it.  Other heroes wind up in the antagonist role for similar reasons.  The theme is more like &#8220;Power corrupts&#8221; &#8211; or perhaps &#8220;Taking power means integrating yourself into a system which can push you into doing terrible things.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, Cordelia Hasenbach is definitely one of the good guys, she claims power because she believes (correctly) that Procer needs to unite against real threats like the Dead King&#8230; but she also calls a crusade against Callow because she needs a way to secure her power base and deal with some problematic underlings.  Catherine mentions that she can understand the logic that led to it, even if she&#8217;s still <i>furious</i> that her homeland was invaded.</p>
<p>And another recurring motif is that becoming Named, whether as a hero or villain, means you&#8217;re constrained by the force of the narrative, giving you power when you play into the role of a classic villain and yanking it away if you try to be reasonable.  One of the long-term antagonists is the Wandering Bard, who has a unique ability to manipulate Named to her advantage and seems to mainly exist to maintain the status quo of this system.</p>
<p>The new villains (The Calamities and the Woe) are unique in that they try to understand these broader forces that drive conflict and stop them at the root.  Amadeus discovers that the reason Praes has such a long tradition of villainy and conquest is because it literally can&#8217;t sustain itself without grain from Callow.  And his solution to that is to break the broader pattern by making Callow permanently aligned with Praes.  Catherine similarly believes that Callow is being destroyed by the cycle of conquest and rebellion, and the Liesse Accords are a similar but broader attempt to create a new pattern for heroes and villains that will be less destructive.</p>
<p>So while you can definitely read it in a conservative way &#8211; &#8220;Hard men/women succeed by making hard decisions,&#8221; you can also read it in a more progressive way &#8211; &#8220;True success comes from understanding the root causes of grievances rather than crushing people with overwhelming force because you&#8217;re convinced of your own righteousness.&#8221;</p>
<p>(Also, while I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ve read that far, a recurring theme from Book 4 onwards is people calling out Catherine for getting innocents killed in the first few books.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Your analysis seems plausible, but you&#8217;ve skipped over major aspects of the series e.g. Good vs Evil, why its not good vs evil, narrative forces, freedom and contractual worship vs obedience and supplicatory worship, cultural and moral evolution etc. Whatever themes there may be, they must account for this.</p>
<p>But to touch on what you&#8217;ve said:<br />
Your political analysis seems to be missing the fact that co-operation is repeatedly shown to outmatch defection. The Calamities brought in a new age because the Wasteland could not unite. The Lone Swordsman became a major threat once he joined forces with others. Triumphant, representing the pinnacle of power, was undone by her lessers uniting. Villains may have virtue, every madman might have the seeds of greatness within them, but their strength is fragile. Their approach to things ultimately doesn&#8217;t scale. Catherine learns the hard way she needs to co-operate with her rivals if she wants to get things done. </p>
<p>Hence the political theme is not that &#8220;&#8230;the villians are sometimes the good guys&#8230;.&#8221;. Rather, villianous virtues can be useful in particular instances, but they are insufficient over longer time scales. Perhaps Dread Emperor Benevolent is a good example of this. Good and Evil (not the same as good and evil) are both useful tools echoing the idea of memetic evolution of morals. </p>
<p>As to social themes, orcs and goblins and so forth have strikingly different cultures which the protagonists admire. Of course this reflects the progressive perspective. But repeatedly we see younger members of these races admitting their people have flaws as they languished for millenia. Hakram states his goal is to change his people. Pickler reviles toxic goblin politics whilst Robber resents the oppresive matriarch and so forth. As such, the is a progressive but not a modern one. </p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
Your question is a little tough to answer because for some rebellions the dust hasn&#8217;t settled, for others the dust settled and its all a mess, and yet others its been a sucess but the means were peaceful. On top of that, we&#8217;re outside observors and what consequences horrify us may thrill most of those affected.</p>
<p>But to attempt this anyhow: Attaturk, M. A. G. Osmani from a Bungladeshi pespective, Hafez al-Assad, Castro according to some and Lenin. There&#8217;s also Stalin according to that one guy who comments here.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I seem to remember a post mentioning a leftist revolutionary group calmly discussing what to do with the quarter or so of the US who would not be on board even after their planned revolution succeeded, the upshot being that those people would have to be reeducated or interned or whatever.  I thought it was in one of Scott&#8217;s posts that mentioned <b>Days of Rage</b>, but I cannot find it.  </p>
<p>Does anyone recall this or have any suggestions for how I might search?  Googling for &#8220;days of rage&#8221; and &#8220;reeducation&#8221; on SSC has not led me to it, and searches for terms like &#8220;revolution,&#8221; &#8220;leftist,&#8221; and &#8220;kill&#8221; would likely result in a deluge of chaff.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m currently playing Kerbal Space Program and watching the Expanse, so I think it&#8217;s a good time for yet another argument about stealth in space.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say the bad guys want to bomb Earth. They have managed to sneak some missiles covered in  radar-absorbing paint far in the outer Solar system, without being detected  (or while being detected but not raising suspicion e.g. because they have a legitimate station on some Trojan asteroid to use as a front). They launch these missiles from their base while the view from Earth is occluded by the asteroid (let&#8217;s assume that Earth doesn&#8217;t have any satellite further away that can observe the launch). Now the missiles are coasting on a Hohmann transfer orbit that takes them directly on a collision course with Earth. If they need to do any correction burn they can use cold gas thrusters. How does Earth detect them?</p>
<p>They only thing I can think of is that as the missiles come closer to the Sun, they are heated by sunlight, becoming visible in the IR spectrum. Sure, if you know where to look and point an IR telescope at them, but if you don&#8217;t know where to look can a broad field of view IR camera looking at the sky see something let&#8217;s say the size of an ICBM at ~100C before it gets too close to intercept?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>You’ve read the primary reference, right?</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve read it again now.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the Oscar&#8217;s crew was shivering at the freezing point, the maximum detection range of the frigid submarine would be 13.4 * sqrt(1510) * 2732 = 38,800,000 kilometers, about one hundred times the distance between the Earth and the Moon, or about 129 light-seconds. If the crew had a more comfortable room temperature, the Oscar could be seen from even farther away.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I guess that even if the thing is unmanned and somehow they managed to hide the exhaust plumes, or launch using a rail gun or something, solar heating would still give it away, unless of course it is extremely fast in which case it wouldn&#8217;t be impossible to intercept even if detected.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Solar heating would probably also give it away yes.  But note that, even back in the late 20th century, the way you knew your country(*) was under long-range missile attack was from a long-range infrared sensor detecting the exhaust plume, and the infrared sensors were located on remote space platforms, carefully positioned to have overlapping and unobstructed views of every place that a missile could plausibly be launched from. Anybody who is remotely interested in space warfighting is going to retain that capability, and they are going to deploy new sensor platforms as it becomes plausible to launch missiles from new locations.</p>
<p>Also, they are going to anticipate the &#8220;what if I shoot the sensor platforms first?&#8221; strategy, but that rapidly moves in a direction where we&#8217;re not talking about it outside a SCIF.</p>
<p>* If your country was the United States or Russia, at least.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>A Hohmann transfer from Pluto to Earth takes several decades (53 years right now, but you could do a little better if you&#8217;re willing to wait a hundred years or so for the planets to be in the right spot).  That means that you need to predict the political situation 53 years in advance &#8211; otherwise you might drop missiles on someone you aren&#8217;t at war with.  You also need to include enough propellant on your missiles that if something does change, you can abort the mission and move the missiles into a safe orbit.</p>
<p>Even if you sneak your missiles all the way to Jupiter (maybe Ganymede is fighting for independence or something), it&#8217;s still a two-year journey.  A lot can change in two years.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>A hohmann trajectory is minimal Δv. (actually for pluto a bi-elliptic transfer might be more efficient)<br />
If you have more fuel, you can get to pluto a lot quicker.  </p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Human beings aren&#8217;t good at reliably moral behavior. Human beings are good at making wonderful things.</p>
<p>This may partly be because it takes smaller subsets to make wonderful things.</p>
<p>In any case, there&#8217;s a good bit of sf and speculation about people being not good enough for aliens to contact or aliens trying to improve us.</p>
<p>What if there were aliens who don&#8217;t care about how people treat each other so long as the flow of wonderful things continues? For purposes of this discussion, &#8220;things&#8221; includes performances, art, mathematics and such, not just material objects.</p>
<p>What are the best circumstances for high quality creation? Is there anything aliens can do to increase the flow of wonderful things? Assume the aliens want both fine expressions of tradition and excellent new forms. Assume their taste isn&#8217;t too different from human taste.</p>
<p>What might the effect on people be? Would people say &#8220;well, there&#8217;s no hope of treating each other better&#8221; or would they say &#8220;that&#8217;s quite an insult, we&#8217;ll show those aliens we can treat each other better&#8221;?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>What if there were aliens who don’t care about how people treat each other so long as the flow of wonderful things continues? </p></blockquote>
<p>This pretty much describes real world trade, so I don&#8217;t see why interstellar would necessarily be different. </p>
<p>Obviously at times trade or warfare have been used for humanitarian reasons, and that may trend more so as a species develops technologically, but it might also be an idiosyncratic human (or even just Western) view.</p>
<p>The bigger question is, why would an alien capable of interstellar travel find our things wonderful? We&#8217;re more likely to be valued for curiosity&#8217;s sake than our craftsmanship, let alone our performance art appealing to ET sensibilities.</p>

<p>Real world trade is between humans.  Nancy posits that the aliens are morally superior to humans and thus have distaste for dealing with them.  If this is so, unlike humans, their profit motive may not overcome their &#8220;don&#8217;t contact or trade with the savages&#8221; taboo.</p>

<p>The aliens just have to get a Patreon account (or, presumably, some equivalent that takes less of a percentage cut) and pay good money to anyone who makes art they like.</p>
<p>The world is full of people who want to make art but can&#8217;t quit their day job.  Just pay them.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I have seen people on my social media feeds juxtaposing photos of the police response to the Minneapolis protests against the killing of George Floyd (which has apparently involved considerable use of tear gas, rubber bullets, and flash-bang grenades) and police response to angry, scuffling anti-lockdown protesters elsewhere, including armed protesters e.g. in Michigan (which, at least in the instances they highlight, has not involved those things), and saying &#8220;why are these different?&#8221; with the implication that it must be either incompetence or racism or both on the part of the Minneapolis police.</p>
<p>And I can well believe it may be those things, but don&#8217;t know enough to have an informed opinion. Folks who are more familiar with the logistics of police response to protests: what other considerations, if any, might produce the different responses? Size of crowd? Specific behaviors of crowd? Other things?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Is this right, though? I&#8217;m thinking of it like this:</p>
<p>Target is on fire. Soon, other things might be on fire. This is no longer a peaceful protest; I need to control it.</p>
<p>Since I can&#8217;t effectively keep people in a large group from hiding amongst each other, I have to either establish lines or disperse the crowd. There&#8217;s no individual action I can take unless I catch the arsonist while he&#8217;s setting autozone on fire.</p>
<p>if there&#8217;s an effective way to control bad actors intermixed with a thousands deep crowd, then I&#8217;m wrong on this, but is there? Cause if there&#8217;s not the group has to be dealt with as a group.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If a protest is small enough that the PD has a good ratio of force and can confidently control the situation, they will sometimes try to grab individual rock throwers, etc OUT of the crowd, cuff them and remove them.

		<div class="comment-body"><p>So, it depends on a department&#8217;s ROE, and sometimes in some gatherings if you have isolated bad actors it may be practical to pull them out and cuff them individually, but past a certain point it no longer makes sense to try and filter the &#8220;Bad&#8221; protesters from the &#8220;good&#8221; ones. A good rule of thumb is that when it comes to protests, they ARE monolithic as long as they are in the same geographic location, and past a certain point is both impractical and unsafe to treat them in any other way.</p>
<p>Now, to be clear, when I say &#8220;same geographic location&#8221; means a discrete mass gathering. If you have 200 people in one neighborhood, and 500 people in another neighborhood 3 miles away, it&#8217;s a lot more reasonable to treat them as two distinct protests. And of course, the qualifier to THAT is that if there is any sort of coordination or communication between those two separate protests, it may be smarter to treat them as one monolithic group when it comes to needing to control them&#8230;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Protesters aren&#8217;t monoliths but (from the law enforcement POV) the bad actors are more or less using the good actors as shields.  If a few dozen out of a few thousand protesters are throwing rocks then the only way to get to those throwing rocks is to push the whole crowd out of the way.  That leaves more or less 3 options, one is to try to disperse the crowd, two is to stand your ground and defend a line but take the general abuse, and three is to retreat and give up the ground.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t see that argument, there is nothing about a free society that requires the police to accept physical abuse, and I think throwing rocks is clearly on the wrong side of &#8216;peaceable assembly&#8217;.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Salvorhardin</p>
<p>A thrown rock is potentially lethal force, and at the very least risks severe injury. So between that, and the fact that the entire point of a mass protest is to leverage the power of numbers <i>as a unified bloc</i>, I don&#8217;t think your argument makes any kind of sense. My advice to protesters who don&#8217;t want to get lumped in with the people chucking rocks, tearing down fences, and vandalizing police cars&#8230;.is don&#8217;t <i>stand with/next to the people doing that</i>. </p>
<p>As I said upthread, police departments DO try to isolate out individual bad actors when it&#8217;s practical to do so, but past a certain point it is illogical, impractical, and unsafe to do so, and your assertion that police should just stand there and take it strikes me as on its face unreasonable.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>That seems unreasonable without any sort of investigation to see if they did anything like that.</p></blockquote>
<p>The police report, <i>as confirmed by the department,</i> stated that Floyd died by a medical accident. The officers in question wore body cams, so ignorance is no excuse here. If they had performed an autopsy, determined it was a freak heart attack, that&#8217;d be one thing. If they had suspended the murderer while conducting an internal investigation, it&#8217;d be one thing. Instead, they immediately released a report stating that it was all a big accident and tried to leave it behind them. It is criminally negligent at the very least and very much grounds for termination of whichever figure did not even think to look into the facts of a person in custody outright dying.</p>
<blockquote><p>Errr, wait, is that the point? We’re not going to bother with an investigation and trial and just do mob justice?</p></blockquote>
<p>Man, screw you. This is the third time I&#8217;ve made this point and you keep insisting on misrepresenting me. Just stop.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s also the whole Michael Brown being a gentle giant narrative being wrong, the cop on Eric Garner not even being indicted, the Freddie Gray cops being acquitted&#8230;you know, there&#8217;s a long history of the justice system finding the mob&#8217;s interpretation being wrong an awful, awful, awful lot.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Another reason to protest is not to demand specific action now, but to punish bad action in the past, and so deter similar bad action in the future. The main cop in question had an extremely checkered history in the police, including involvement in multiple suspicious killings. The Minneapolis PD could and should have prevented this by firing/desking the guy. If you&#8217;re an elected official or police chief and you want to avoid these sorts of protests you should get your bad apples off the street now.</p>

<p>You ever sit on a jury? Because a lot of these guys and gals that are supposedly horrendous  and unlawful monsters faced juries and were acquitted. Juries might be wrong, but these cases weren&#8217;t tried in the 60s, these were tried 5-10 years ago. </p>

<p>Video footage has now spread beyond the immediate department to people who might nominally be sympathetic.

Firing people non-chalantly is pretty cavalier.</p>

<p>He had apparently 18 complaints in his 19 year career, and two reprimands.  Two cases of firing a gun.  It is hard to say whether he should have been fired for any of this, what is the base rate for complaints against police officers, and does it really warrant the label &#8220;extremely checkered&#8221;?  Some of these are his word against the victims (e.g. Ira Toles), and I don&#8217;t think it is unreasonable that the officer is given the benefit of the doubt here &#8211; Toles was armed and also likely to be violent (the call was domestic abuse).  In any case, that was 14 years ago.</p>

<p>For municipal police, one in ten per year, thereabouts, so the theoretical average cop with twenty years would have two. Having one complaint against you for every year of service means you are an really extreme outlier, and if they were independent complaints, well, letting that go on is just incompetent management. Two firearm discharges on top of that is no longer a red flag, his employee record folder is just fire engine red at that point.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>That is a rhetorical question with an actual answer!</p></blockquote>
<p>Why did you think it was rhetorical?</p>
<blockquote><p>For municipal police, one in ten per year, thereabouts, so the theoretical average cop with twenty years would have two. </p></blockquote>
<p>A couple of things:</p>
<p>This details the number of complaints, but each complaint may involve more than one officer.  Most of the examples given do.</p>
<p>The number is only complaints on use of force, this may be the most common complaint, but I don&#8217;t think we know that all 18 complaints concern violence.  Of the listed cases, one was a chased car that crashed into another (no violence?), another was one of Chavin&#8217;s colleagues opening fire on an armed suspect (violence, but not by Chavin).  Mostly we don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>The distribution is likely to be skewed.  County police has 30% the number of complaints of Municipal, there could be internal differences related to precinct or type of service.  The rate for officers responding to calls seems to be 50% higher than for (presumably) those with desk jobs.</p>
<p>Number of complaints also scale with agency size.  If Minneapolice PD is large, there would statistically be a higher rate.</p>
<p>TL;DR: I don&#8217;t think we have quite enough data to conclude that Chauvin was &#8220;excessive&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote><p>Two firearm discharges on top of that is no longer a red flag, his employee record folder is just fire engine red at that point.</p></blockquote>
<p>In  both cases, the target was armed and known to be violent.<br />
To quote LA Times: </p>
<blockquote><p>Anyone can file a complaint against an officer, whether or not it’s valid</p></blockquote>
<p>Do you really want a society where all it takes is a series of unproven accusations  to get a cop fired?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>According to <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_George_Floyd#Police_officers" rel="nofollow ugc">Wikipedia</a>: &#8220;Derek Michael Chauvin, a 44-year-old white man, had been an officer in the Minneapolis Police Department since around 2001.[30] Chauvin had 18 complaints on his official record, two of which ended in discipline from the department including official letters of reprimand.[31] &#8221;</p>
<p>If they had to reprimand him twice, then there was more to it than &#8220;a series of unproven accusations&#8221;. What is the median number of official letters of reprimand that a cop gets throughout their career? I guess it&#8217;s zero. After the second one the police department should really have considered at least desking him.</p>
<p>The protesters are right that such person should not have been policing the streets. This doesn&#8217;t justify the looting and burning, of course.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t share your faith in the impartiality of juries. Grand juries are routinely reluctant to indict cops, and trial juries to convict them. That doesn&#8217;t give me particularly strong evidence that the cops did nothing wrong. Certainly not in a case like Eric Garner&#8217;s, where I can see for myself that the jury&#8217;s decision made no sense.</p>
<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Please note that I&#8217;m not defending the burning of buildings. I don&#8217;t see any reason to suppose that the protesters are wrong about what happened to George Floyd, no.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Beyond parsing one cop&#8217;s record (though in the case of Ira Toles, Toles wasn&#8217;t armed, he allegedly reached for an officer&#8217;s gun, which is a completely unfalsifiable claim) there is the fact that every other developed country manages to have a police forces that kill a lot fewer citizens. Protestors have some ideas about how to change that, but eventually it&#8217;s up to police department and governments to get cops to stop killing so many people.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The US also has just much higher levels of murders for a variety of reasons, probably rooted in our history. Given a higher level of murders, that we have higher level of fatal law enforcement, is not surprising. </p>
<p>Cynically, the Minnesota Governor wants to isolate the looters. If the protestors feel the looters are not misguided allies, but enemies, it becomes a lot easier to stop the looters. If there is a shred of evidence that the looters contain white supremacists who are trying to radicalize their support base then the goveneror has every reason to mention it. And the looting is possibly the best thing that has happened so far this year for an extreme white supremacists so it is not absurd to think some might try to encourage looting. The more looting, the more support white supremacists get from their potential allies. Also free TVs.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not a &#8220;policy choice&#8221; that anyone can realistically do anything about, and even if they did, change would happen on the order of decades, not months or years.</p>
<p>The second amendment is a &#8220;policy choice&#8221; in the same sense that the EU having dozens of languages and a lack of shared cultural identification is a &#8220;policy choice&#8221;.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>though in the case of Ira Toles, Toles wasn’t armed, he allegedly reached for an officer’s gun, which is a completely unfalsifiable claim</p></blockquote>
<p>Right, thanks for the correction.  LA Times wrote &#8220;When Toles reached for his gun&#8230;&#8221; which can be interpreted both ways, but your reading sound much more likely (and presumably other sources make it clear).</p>
<p>Toles&#8217; statement isn&#8217;t particularly credible to me, I can imagine a cop beating a guy who abuses his girlfriend, and it may have been a false accusation (re the birdwatcher case), but shooting him seems most likely if there was a struggle.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I saw a couple hours of video filmed from a helicopter Wednesday, and there was basically no effort made to stop the looting. The police were surrounded and stayed in a small area near the police station. There was never any question of controlling the looting; protecting the station seemed to be the main concern (it was set on fire the next night, so it seems to have been a legitimate concern).</p>
<p>The rioting/looting was happening concurrently across the street and within the next few blocks. There looked to be no police presence in the surrounding areas until buildings were set on fire and someone was shot that evening looting a pawn shop.</p>
<p>The protests and the riots could almost be treated as separate events for most of Wednesday, at least. Less so on Thursday.</p>
<p>Edit: <a rel="nofollow"href="https://kstp.com/minnesota-news/lake-street-target-looted-as-protests-continue-in-minneapolis-may-riots-george-floyd/5743072/" rel="nofollow ugc">Link</a> if anyone wants to try to get a line on what happened with the police response. It&#8217;s pretty hard to see, though.<br />
Video is down at the bottom of the page and is a little over 2 hours long.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>There are definitely versions of the confrontation that makes it very difficult to come up with a resolution (which is often the case when two bad actors get into it).  If there is looting and a separate protest that is effectively blocking the police from addressing the looting what is the solution?  Considering the station was burned after being abandoned by the police makes it even more difficult in hindsight to propose a serious solution that could be enacted in real time.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>After calling the lockdown protesters terrorists, she really has no other tack to take on this.</p>
<p>According to <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.fox9.com/news/timeline-death-of-george-floyd-reactions-and-protests" rel="nofollow ugc">this timeline</a>, tear gas didn&#8217;t start till they started going after the cars and ripping down the precint fence.  I have yet to see anyone preaching the provocation excuse present an alternate timeline.</p>
<p>The only way I can see this framing working is if it comes out that there were police agent provocateurs in the crowd setting stuff on fire and attacking cop cars.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>This was the quote on my feed. It came from a page called The Other 98%.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so people are clear about what happened in Minneapolis last night. Police did not unload on the protesters to stop looting. That was happening way off in the distance. Police were unloading on everyone protesting in front of Precinct 3. The arson and widespread looting down the lake street, only happened after loads of us were hurt from volley after volley of tear gas, mace, concussion grenades, and sponge rounds. It was completely indiscriminate I was hit in the butt while walking in the street away from the precinct. A CS canister hit me square in the forehead knocking me to the ground and blinding me for an hour while I was simply kneeling in a grassy area some ways from the police. Police weren&#8217;t &#8216;responding&#8217; to an ongoing riot they CAUSED it. First with their murder of George Floyd and refusal to prosecute the criminals, and second through their massive repression against protesters who never crossed a police line or endangered any cop. The photos your all seeing is the righteous fury of a people denied justice by their city.<br />

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You&#8217;re conflating two separate groups. Per this information there&#8217;s one group of people trying to protest and another group of people who see a bunch of people protesting and think, &#8220;hmm, great time to go loot Target.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thinking about it this way may seem like I&#8217;m trying to absolve the protesters of all guilt in this, but thinking about it your way tarnishes everyone in this group by the worst actions of someone they probably wouldn&#8217;t even include in their number.</p>

<p>If you look at some of the videos at that link I posted upthread, it appears that protesters were throwing rocks and smoke bombs 30 minutes before the teargas came out.  Did the facebook post provide a timeline?  I can see it being a legitimate mistake if his vison was blocked.  He might have thought that the smoke bombs were gas canisters from the cops.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Police were unloading on everyone protesting in front of Precinct 3.</p></blockquote>
<p>So that would be the precinct where at least some members of the protesting crowd were chucking rocks and other objects, and had torn down the fencing around the motor pool and were starting to attack police vehicles where equipment to include firearms were secured? </p>
<p>&#8230;.yeah, no, see my comment above. At that point it is entirely reasonable to start &#8220;unloading&#8221; as the complainants put it with tear gas and baton rounds to control and disperse the crowd, so if that&#8217;s the area where people are alleging inappropriate use of force, my sympathy for the protesters caught up in the police response pretty much just evaporated.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I live in Minneapolis, and the initial incident happened about 1/2 mile from my house. Although the rioting is a few miles away, because all the good stuff to loot is there (and the police precinct building).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard a lot of contradictory stuff about the police using rubber bullets, tear gas etc. either in response to the rioting, or on peaceful protesters causing the riot. As has been discussed, it makes no sense that police violence will cause looting and destruction of all retail, so I certainly don&#8217;t buy that second narrative. And I did hear about destruction happening well before police violence, as well as looting and violence far away from the police building, so obviously not caused by the police actions.</p>
<p>And there was only that initial phase of police action. I have heard that the mayor has instructed the police to not arrest anyone, and to do no more than tell folks to move along. And the mayor even had them abandon the precinct building, which is why it was fired. Now the looting and destruction has spread to other parts of the city, and to St Paul and the suburbs. This is what happens when you ignore public vandalism and destruction, it gets bigger. I assume at some point the mayor will get religion and realize that yes the cops are necessary to maintain order, even when they did a bad thing.</p>
<p>There is much discussion about the looters and vandals being completely separate people from the protesters. I think this may be correct for the most part. There are some folks out there that really do like to cause destruction (anarchists, antifa), and some professional thieves who go in with trucks and take lots of stuff from stores. There are plenty of others that will follow along and grab some items from the stores and add to the general mayhem of destroying stores, but the initiative I think is mostly a few people that care not a bit about the excuse for the looting and destruction (the police killing in this case). The cops need to stop these people, or they will destroy a lot of the city, even if the peaceful ones are the majority. And in fact the peaceful ones now have a lot of notice of what&#8217;s going on, they need to get out of the riot areas, or it is their own fault.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The part that surprises me about this incident is that it happened in Minneapolis. Minneapolis has a reputation as one of the nice liberal parts of the country, a place that has its shit together, more Switzerland and less Brazil. I&#8217;ve heard it called the best city in America that doesn&#8217;t have a coastline. Is that reputation not entirely deserved?</p>

<p>In some corners, maybe.  Probably not so much in <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Justine_Damond" rel="nofollow ugc">Australia</a>.  And no matter how &#8220;nice&#8221; you think <i>Minneapolis</i> is, this is the third time in four years that the Minneapolis <i>police(*)</i> killed someone who clearly did not need to be killed in a way that the local DA at least thought constituted literal murder.  Even the stereotypically nice liberal people of Minnesota, might get a bit peeved about that.</p>

<p>Yes they sometimes call us the Canada of the US. I presume the niceness of Canada is way over-stated also?</p>
<p>I think part of the issue with Minneapolis  is that until a few decades ago we were very homogenously White. A lot of Blacks have now moved to the city. There has been lots of discussion about how the racial gap in education, income, etc. is higher in Minnesota than other states. This actually makes sense to me because being new residents will likely bring down the average education and income, so add that to the Black disadvantage and you get a large racial gap. But it definitely makes for a lot of resentment by Blacks. I think added to that is the very blue region (Omar Ilhan is our Rep) in my opinion makes racial resentments much higher by constantly encouraging such stuff.</p>
<p>This is very much like what I&#8217;ve heard the issues being in Stockholm. I am waiting for racial riots to happen there.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>One major difference is that the armed militia members are often keenly aware of the line between legal and illegal actions, especially with regard to the exact type of gun they are allowed to own and carry in public in these situations.  There is also the likelihood that if they start throwing rocks/bottles etc at the cops while holding weapons the response is more likely to escalate beyond rubber bullets and tear gas which is the standard response in the US for unarmed protests that get unruly.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yeah, if the protesters are all armed, I think everyone understands that the stakes around starting some violence (tossing bricks or Molotov cocktails, using tear gas, etc.) are much, much higher.  Sufficiently so that probably if one of the protesters looks like he&#8217;s about to heave a brick, he&#8217;s going to have the other protesters stopping him.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ve always thought the difference between the Standing Rock thing the Bundy thing was instructive. A lot of people in my bubbles framed it as white privilege, and that&#8217;s probably part of it, but I wonder what would have happened had the water-protectors shown up with AR-15s and told the authorities to go pound sand. Was it really Bundy&#8217;s whiteness that let (lets? is he still there and not paying his fees?) him flout the law, or his guns and willingness to kill (or at least threaten to kill) law enforcement?</p>

<p>As far as I can tell none of the fires or looting occurred the first night, though the initial posting arguably might have been as it was focused on police response.</p>

<p>Going back through the videos I can find, I think you&#8217;re right about the fires.  It was raining, and even though there&#8217;s a bunch of smoke, they were throwing a lot of smoke bombs.  </p>
<p>Ironically, the Wikipedia <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_George_Floyd" rel="nofollow ugc"> article</a> agrees with earlier me, though I no longer believe it.</p>
<blockquote><p>After Floyd&#8217;s death, demonstrations and protests in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area were initially peaceful on May 26, but later that day turned destructive as windows were smashed at a police precinct, two stores were set on fire, and many stores were looted and damaged.</p></blockquote>
<p>I followed the sources and it looks like the fires were on the 27th.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think the point of the 3 day rule, in addition to perhaps allowing tempers to cool, is to make sure we are working on more accurate information. </p>
<p>When there is a mass shooting, we often get media misreporting some important detail of the suspect, and his agenda and demographics will be speculated on after each corrected report in an unhelpful and unseemly manner.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I just tried making a muffin recipe which called for yogurt, and now I&#8217;m wondering &#8211; how do you measure yogurt out for baking without making a huge mess? Unlike milk, you can&#8217;t really pour it, and scooping results in it getting all over the outside and handle of the cup and hence the counter top. Also, it&#8217;s not homogenous like milk &#8211; I wasn&#8217;t sure whether I should stir it first and if so, what the best way to do so is.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard that yogurt is a popular ingredient in baked goods, so surely people have solved these problems. Does anyone know how to bake with yogurt properly?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If you measure by weight it&#8217;s easy &#8211; just tare out your scale and spoon the requisite about into the bowl.</p>
<p>If you go by volume, well, that&#8217;s trickier, but a spoon is still your best bet. Just transfer it into the measuring cup, smooth it out then dump it in.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You should definitely get a scale. It&#8217;s extremely helpful when baking, and you can get a fine one for less than $20. I basically never use measuring cups, and it means less cleanup because you can add an ingredient to the bowl, zero it out, and add the next one.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I know some baking items are in short supply now, but a scale makes things much easier and more accurate, so it&#8217;s something I&#8217;d highly recommend looking for if you think baking is something you&#8217;ll stick with.

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Private investors won&#8217;t due to the risk of expropriation and other forces majeures.  </p>
<p>The maduro regime either doesn&#8217;t have the resources, the capacity or the will to do so.<br />
Mineral wealth is a great thing for dictators because they only have to keep the military/police and the people running the mines/wells happy. If you want to set up an oil refinery, you need a lot more skilled tradesmen/welders and highly skilled chemical engineers, taught by university faculties.  </p>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot of hard-to-replace middle class people who you now rely on.  </p>
<p>Also oil is stupidly cheap to ship around, which means that there&#8217;s little natural reason to refine the oil near the wells.<br />
NZ has wells and a refinery but it exports its light sweet domestic oil while importing medium sour crude for the refinery. It just works out more efficiently that way.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Because &#8220;Venezuela&#8221; doesn&#8217;t know how to build an oil refinery.</p>
<p>For the past twenty years Venezuelan government policy has been that anyone who insists on getting paid serious money to build or even operate oil infrastructure, while the poor are suffering, is an Enemy of the People who must be taxed into oblivion and purged if they object to the taxed-into-oblivion part.  Since the set &#8220;people who insist on getting paid serious money to build oil infrastructure&#8221; strongly overlaps the set &#8220;people who actually know how to build oil infrastructure&#8221;, and since they&#8217;re serious about the <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-nov-25-fi-venoil25-story.html" rel="nofollow ugc">purges</a>, there&#8217;s basically no one left in Venezuela who might know how to actually build an oil refinery.</p>
<p>No, they can&#8217;t hire people who know how to build oil refineries to come to their country to build refineries for them, or even teach them how to build oil refineries for themselves, because they&#8217;re pretty much out of money and they have a twenty-year track record of purging anyone fool enough to actually insist on getting paid or that sort of work.  No, they can&#8217;t have a bunch of regime loyalists read the &#8220;Building Oil Refineries for Dummies&#8221; book and build an oil refinery, because the resulting collection of impressive-looking junk would be about as likely to refine oil as a Melanesian cargo-cultist&#8217;s airport is to become an international transit hub.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>This is a great answer. VZ could import the expertise from Russia if needed. But the issue is the VZ&#8217;s crude is particularly unsuitable for use, and required more refining that oil from Saudi Arabia, for example. Additionally, VZ&#8217;s reserves are geologically deep and expensive to tap.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yeah.  I&#8217;m not an expert on this, but my general understanding was that all else equal, VZ&#8217;s crude is among the most undesirable in the world.  In an era of falling oil prices (due to supply vastly exceeding demand), they&#8217;re the first ones to no longer be worth the hassle.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I asked our Venezuelan engineers if they wanted to move back to Venezuela to help them build an oil refinery. They said &#8220;hell no.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also the Turkish engineer also volunteered that he sure is hell not going back to Turkey. </p>
<p>Also the Balkan machinists volunteered they do not want to go back to the Disneyland of Ethnic Cleansing. </p>
<p>Actually basically all of our engineers, machinists, and mechanics are from countries that were not well-run. </p>
<p>Theoretically we could build a factory there, but we did that once, and then it got Worker Counciled, so Chavez and his cronies get to try to run it now. Looks like they got Galt&#8217;d.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>A couple of reasons:</p>
<p>1. Building a refinery doesn&#8217;t get you gasoline. It gets you a massive up-front cost that will, hopefully one day result in you getting gasoline. Venezuela doesn&#8217;t need another massive public works project that will hopefully make things better someday, they need gas now. It&#8217;s the same reason you don&#8217;t plant some wheat when you want bread. </p>
<p>2. One of the hallmarks of the Chavista mindset (and arguably most past Venezuelan governments), at least economically, has always been &#8220;if we need something, we can just import it.&#8221; For most of these people&#8217;s proffesional lives they&#8217;ve say on massive cash reserves that let them buy what they need. When your government is structured around buying off your populace, it&#8217;s really hard to shake the habit of buying off your populace. </p>
<p>3. Like everyone else said &#8211; there are enough uncertainties around working with Venezuela that most reputable foreign powers would balk at working with the Maduro regime no matter the cost. They also purged everyone inside PVDSA years ago who could have done something like this internally.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Like everyone else said – there are enough uncertainties around working with Venezuela</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s even really any uncertainty at this point.  If you go to Venezuela to build an oil refinery, as a lone specialist or an international conglomerate with a full organization, it&#8217;s now quite certain that you&#8217;re not going to get paid in anything resembling real money.  I suppose there&#8217;s some uncertainty in where exactly the line between &#8220;fled the country empty-handed&#8221; and &#8220;got lynched for making too much fuss about not getting paid&#8221; is drawn.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>As we all know, Twitter and Facebook and the like are hard to dislodge because of network effects. There might be a technically better site than Twitter, but if everyone you want to interact with is already on Twitter, then there will be nobody to talk to on the new site, and it&#8217;s too hard to coordinate everyone moving.</p>
<p>Trump is unhappy with Twitter now. It seems like he&#8217;s one of very few people who could coordinate a move to a new social network &#8211; if he declared he was switching to using a Twitter alternative he would get a significant number of people to at least read the new site, including a lot of influential people.</p>
<p>Is there a decent Twitter alternative he could go to? Do you think he&#8217;d be able to make it viable?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>There are probably quite a few people who hate-follow and hate-respond to Trump. They would follow him to whichever platform he&#8217;ll go to, as long as he&#8217;s POTUS, to continue hate-following him. Then there are the real followers, of course.</p>
<p>But whenever I look at the responses to Trump&#8217;s tweets, the top ones are always negative ones.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>consider exactly who would choose to move to a new social media platform specifically because Trump is using it.</p></blockquote>
<p>I can think of quite a few:<br />
&#8211; People who have been looking for a viable twitter alternative for years and think POTUS plugging one might just make it viable.<br />
&#8211; People who are already juggling half a dozen social media platforms and consider adding one more to be a low cost.<br />
&#8211; People from Minnesota&#8217;s fifth congressional district that are concerned about political censorship (likely to be mostly Republicans, because they&#8217;re on the losing end of this particular action).<br />
&#8211; People who have curtailed their social media participation due to concerns about the sort of harassment campaigns that twitter has become known for.<br />
&#8211; People who are tired of having any platform that isn&#8217;t actively hostile to them called a &#8220;sewer&#8221;.</p>
<p>Your comment actually provides an excellent example of why a lot of people might be inclined to move.  Writing off half the country as undesirables that your platform is better off without would not be a good way to maintain a monopoly, even if it were true.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not that. The problem is that even if the people that you mention are superbly principled effortposters making up a majority of the userbase, a minority of trolls will out-shitpost them till it&#8217;s a sewer.</p>

<p>How would this be different from Twitter?  Community moderation is hard and I don&#8217;t know many people who think Twitter has solved it already.</p>
<p>Are you assuming that anywhere Trump would move would be less moderated, not just differently moderated?</p>

<p>He also has the constraint of using an American platform. He can&#8217;t move to TikTok, can he? And even Telegram is probably out&#8230; And American social media platforms are made in Silicon Valley, and most of them will lean left.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m starting to think that he can <i>just compel them to stop</i>. The Second Circuit <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.477261/gov.uscourts.nysd.477261.76.0.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">said</a> that Trump&#8217;s tweets are &#8220;government speech&#8221;, and that</p>
<blockquote><p>Under the government speech doctrine, &#8220;[t]he Free Speech Clause does not require government to maintain viewpoint neutrality when its officers and employees speak&#8221; about governmental endeavors. For example, when the government wishes to promote a war effort, it is not required by the First Amendment to also distribute messages discouraging that effort.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cornell Law School <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-1/the-government-speech-doctrine" rel="nofollow ugc">says:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>A central issue prompted by the government speech doctrine is determining when speech is that of the government, which can be difficult when the government utilizes or relies on private parties to relay a particular message. In Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Association, the Court held that the First Amendment did not prohibit the compelled subsidization of advertisements promoting the sale of beef because the underlying message of the advertisements was “effectively controlled” by the government.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that this implies that if a printing company generally provides printing services to the public, and the government put in an order with them to print up pamphlets with government speech (promoting a war effort or whatever), and they said, &#8220;Not unless we get to put on a disclaimer that says we don&#8217;t like it,&#8221; the gov&#8217;t could just flatly compel them. I don&#8217;t think, &#8220;You don&#8217;t understand, we don&#8217;t let this content through unaltered for any of our customers; we don&#8217;t sell &#8220;printing services&#8221;, we sell &#8220;content augmentation and printing services&#8221; is going to fly. You&#8217;d probably have to get into Masterpiece Cakeshop land and assert a personal religious/philosophical objection that is significantly heftier than, &#8220;I take it upon myself to do good in the world, and I think that includes correcting misinformation or whatever.&#8221;</p>
<p>[EDIT: Note that the Second Circuit crucially distinguished between the tweets, themselves, which it determined were government speech, and the interactive features that allow the public to respond, which is a public forum. I think the gov&#8217;t can argue that if Twitter wants to engage in the public forum, they can do so via a regular account, just like everyone else. They can&#8217;t force their pamphlet to be an attachment to the government&#8217;s pamphlet.</p>
<p>Further thinking: The interesting conclusion here is that if Twitter had tried to do this when Trump was a candidate, they might have gotten away with it. It&#8217;s only after he became president, and the Second Circuit agreed that his tweets are government speech that they became unable. Seems almost symmetric and fair: he loses the right to ban people; Twitter loses the right to &#8220;correct&#8221; him.</p>
<p>Revisited: I was worried for a second, but I&#8217;mma go with it. Let me know what you think. I think the prior compelled speech cases can be distinguished. Miami Herald (no &#8220;fairness doctrine&#8221; for newspapers) rested on the fact that newspapers &#8220;are a finite endeavor&#8221;, which isn&#8217;t going to fly for Twitter. Wooley has to be interpreted in light of Walker. I think that it would imply that Twitter can&#8217;t be forced to carry Trump&#8217;s tweet at all (perhaps they could just delete it), but if they do carry it, they can&#8217;t force their message into his government speech.]</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s at all plausible that they could force Scott to post <i>blog posts</i>. That&#8217;s core speech that is clearly controlled by Scott. But suppose Trump made a commenting account here&#8230;</p>
<p>Someone else can write the XKCD-style What-If? How the site traffic would explode, how Scott would respond, how much attention Trump would pay to any responses to responses (or follow-up articles), and all the glorious fallout from the shitshow that would result. Make this extra funny.</p>
<p>Legally speaking, the more I read, the more I think these are actually super hard cases. I think the closest to on-point cases concerning Twitter are two cases about license plates and one about recruiting people join the Army. Yeah. It&#8217;s that bad. I&#8217;ve said before that my greatest hope for a Trump administration is to get interesting SCOTUS cases that illuminate interesting parts of the law, and this would certainly be it. A variety of thoughts:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow"href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/430/705.html" rel="nofollow ugc">Wooley</a> has the broadest worded statement that would restrict the government:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are thus faced with the question of whether the State may constitutionally require an individual to participate in the dissemination of an ideological message by displaying it on his private property in a manner and for the express purpose that it be observed and read by the public. We hold that the State may not do so.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<i>Individual</i>&#8221; cuts a bit against Twitter, and a bit toward Scott. &#8220;Participate in the dissemination&#8221; sounds extremely broad, but if we loose it from its qualifier, we basically open it up to where ISPs could say they have a right to refuse to carry Trump&#8217;s tweets (or the right to alter them or amend them or whatever; also, this would seem to Constitutionalize anti-net-neutrality, because the gov&#8217;t couldn&#8217;t force them to carry other people&#8217;s ideological messages, either). The qualifier &#8220;by displaying it on his private property&#8221; is absolute bait for the digital/physical distinction. Is it the physical server? Twitter probably owns their servers. Scott probably doesn&#8217;t. Is it the domain? I mean, maybe? That screws over people who host their blog actually on WordPress.com. Is it the physical device on which the tweet is actually <i>displayed</i>? That would screw over both Scott and everyone else (so they won&#8217;t pick that option).</p>
<p>Since we can&#8217;t just ignore the qualifier &#8220;by displaying it on his private property&#8221; (lest we Constitutionalize ISP-based censorship) and it might be a nightmare to apply a property analysis (paging Justice Gorsuch, though), I sort of think that the Court will be have to tread new ground beyond <i>Wooley</i> alone.</p>
<p>So, then, there&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/14-144" rel="nofollow ugc">Walker</a>. From Texas; not a ranger. Texas allowed individuals to design their own license plates, but some Confederates submitted a design they didn&#8217;t like. Key quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>But here, compelled private speech is not at issue. And just as Texas cannot require SCV to convey “the State’s ideological message,” SCV cannot force Texas to include a Confederate battle flag on its specialty license plates.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s a Breyer opinion, so naturally I can&#8217;t understand it (I kid). But, basically, when people see license plates, they think it&#8217;s the government speaking; they think it&#8217;s something that the government endorses; therefore, it&#8217;s &#8220;government speech&#8221;. So Texas got to refuse an outside party&#8217;s attempt to, uh, help them craft that speech.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#8217;s Rumsfeld v. FAIR. The gov&#8217;t required equal access to law school campuses for DOD recruiters as was given to other recruiters. To totally bastardize an analogy, the court treated the physical conduct of recruiting like a platform.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Solomon Amendment neither limits what law schools may say nor requires them to say anything. Law schools remain free under the statute to express whatever views they may have on the military’s congressionally mandated employment policy, all the while retaining eligibility for federal funds. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 25 (Solicitor General acknowledging that law schools “could put signs on the bulletin board next to the door, they could engage in speech, they could help organize student protests”). As a general matter, the Solomon Amendment regulates conduct, not speech. It affects what law schools must <i>do</i>—afford equal access to military recruiters—not what they may or may not <i>say</i>.</p></blockquote>
<p>That parenthetical is important, because it&#8217;s perhaps the closest actual thing. But what&#8217;s really interesting is that this same argument was tried in Wooley &#8211; the dissent said:</p>
<blockquote><p>As found by the New Hampshire Supreme Court in Hoskin, there is nothing in state law which precludes appellees from displaying their disagreement with the state motto as long as the methods used do not obscure the license plates. Thus appellees could place on their bumper a conspicuous bumper sticker explaining in no uncertain terms that they do not profess the motto &#8220;Live Free or Die&#8221; and that they violently disagree with the connotations of that motto. Since any implication that they affirm the motto can be so easily displaced, I cannot agree that the state statutory system for motor vehicle identification and tourist promotion may be invalidated under the fiction that appellees are unconstitutionally forced to affirm, or profess belief in, the state motto.</p></blockquote>
<p>But that was <i>the dissent</i>. It lost. So, why did it win in FAIR? And what are the bounds for which type of options for dissent are sufficient? This is part of why I quoted the bit from the Second Circuit about, &#8220;when the government wishes to promote a war effort, it is not required by the First Amendment to also distribute messages discouraging that effort.&#8221; So, who is doing what here? Trump&#8217;s tweet is &#8220;government speech&#8221;. It&#8217;s indicated that it&#8217;s Trump&#8217;s, with a blue check and everything. Can Twitter (or even an ISP) jump into the tweet, itself, and attach their own message to it? Is this like a car owner trying to jump in and attach his confederate message to the government&#8217;s license plate speech? Is the tweet more like their private property that the gov&#8217;t is forcing them to display their message on? What if they want to just ban him? Maybe they can/can&#8217;t do that on equal terms to how they treat other <strike>recruiters</strike> users on their <strike>campus</strike> platform, and can&#8217;t nose themselves into the individual conversations? Or would banning him be like trying to ban a license plate from your car altogether? The role of the counter-speech and the mechanism by which it&#8217;s applied is <i>super</i> unclear.</p>
<p>So, I sort of keep coming back to the Second Circuit, talking about how they have to look at the nature of how the &#8220;property&#8221; (tech) works and the practices. I think they rely a fair amount on local norms, but that&#8217;s not entirely controlling (he can&#8217;t ban folks, while that&#8217;s a normal feature of the tech that others use). They&#8217;re trying to make &#8220;corrections&#8221; a part of the local norm, but wew lad, can you imagine reduxing Walker with a hypothetical Confederate-owned Twitter jumping in with, &#8220;Learn the facts about the glorious Confederate battle flag&#8221;? Delivered as part of the &#8220;government speech&#8221;? Going back to the top line, whatever else is the case, I don&#8217;t think Trump can force Scott to let him post blog posts (or if Twitter had a company blog). I have basically no clue if folks could ban him. Given Scott&#8217;s tools/norms, I don&#8217;t think he could jump in and add to Trump&#8217;s <i>comments</i> here, but he could certainly reply with a comment of his own.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to have to buy so much popcorn for opinion days in June 2021.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>1) No one is paying Twitter to tweet, despite each tweet costing Twitter a minuscule amount to host and deliver.<br />
2) Twitter provides a forum that has to deal with every response to each tweet. This has further costs, especially if a particular tweet gets a lot of back and forth.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what precedence and arguments were used in the case, but Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Association seems far more akin to Union shop fees than to mandating that a publisher itself be compelled to freely print a statement unrelated to its core business.</p>
<p>Now if the government wants to compel Twitter to start tweeting about the benefits of free and truly unbiased social media, your argument may fly.</p>
<p>Just my opinion.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>1) No one is paying Twitter to tweet</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure why that matters.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;despite each tweet costing Twitter a minuscule amount to host and deliver.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m interpreting this point and a half to conceptually amount to, &#8220;It costs them.&#8221; Sure, that was part of the deal in Miami Herald. Newspapers are pretty limited. The Court called them a &#8220;finite endeavor&#8221;. There, the idea that for every additional thing you put in, you have to take something out is actually sort of meaningful. Removing ads &#8211; stupid expensive. Adding pages &#8211; stupid expensive. Or you have to actually cut other stuff out. Nobody thinks the de minimis costs of additional hosting is remotely similar than the financial costs to newspapers (and frankly, even if they decided to ban <i>all</i> accounts from any government entity, I don&#8217;t think the cost savings would be significant enough for the Justices to even bat an eye at the difference). In fact, lots of folks argue that in Twitter&#8217;s model, the customers are the product; you provide them value by using their service. And to the extent that (2) comes into play, if they gain value from people interacting with Twitter, Trump may be their most valuable user. Additionally, there is no sense in which the idea that &#8220;if Trump puts content in, they&#8217;re required to cut other content&#8221; is anything but laughable.</p>
<p>Re: Johanns v. LMA, I think you&#8217;re right. Except, I think printing statements unrelated to their core business is their core business. Similar to how ISPs transmitting statements that aren&#8217;t about the glory of burying cables in the ground is part of their core business.</p>
<blockquote><p>Just my opinion.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s all any of us have. Except SCOTUS. They have The Opinion (&#8230;sometimes they&#8217;ll have two or more, but they at least <i>try</i> to point more intently at one of them).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>It’s all any of us have. Except SCOTUS. They have The Opinion (…sometimes they’ll have two or more, but they at least try to point more intently at one of them).</p></blockquote>
<p>They do a good job of not giving any opinion if they can&#8217;t point more intently at one of them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a constitutional textualist. The 1st amendment effectively grants citizens free speech toward their government. Nothing in the US constitution grants the government any power of speech (read literally) whatsoever. All of these SCOTUS rulings are thus rulings on subordinate federal laws, other constitutional powers such as the right to tax (taxation is limited to money, I believe, as conscription is not considered taxation), or are narrow rulings stating that the government obviously has the right to speak if said speech is a de facto requirement for the exercise of a power granted to the government.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m quite sure SCOTUS would disagree with me here, but philosophically that&#8217;s where I would argue this issue from.</p>
<p>Obscuring license plates is an issue not because the license plate is government speech, but because the government cannot function without seeing the license plate.</p>
<p>Having looked at the mail-in ballot tweet, I believe that Twitter&#8217;s alteration of it does realistically look like Trump made the fact-check link about mail-in ballots. They should have put a door up, not apparently modified his tweet. I can see a real argument against what they did. If they had put a door up (like they do for &#8220;sensitive content&#8221;, I would see no problem.</p>

<blockquote><p>1) No one is paying Twitter to tweet</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure why that matters.</p></blockquote>
<p>Your original post gave the example of a print shop &#8211; you pay them to print what you wrote, not to print it with a bit of editorializing on whatever you wrote.  And the case you&#8217;re citing is about a livestock company being compelled to contribute to a government-run advertising program.  In both cases, the government is paying for the speech it&#8217;s producing &#8211; either directly or by taxation.</p>
<p>But you don&#8217;t pay Twitter for anything.  Advertisers pay Twitter, and Twitter lets you post so that you&#8217;ll view the ads.  You don&#8217;t give Twitter anything except a 140-character piece of your mind.  And I don&#8217;t buy the argument that, simply because the government has <i>said </i>something to you, that you&#8217;re compelled to distribute that statement in the manner that they wanted.</p>

<p>Fair. I actually meant to mention this at some point. I wanted to discuss how my biggest uncertainty would be the mechanism by which they could affirmatively assert something. I&#8217;d amend my initial statement to be that I think he could just compel them to do it <i>first amendment notwithstanding</i>. I know there are other free-floating grants of power to government to demand services (we saw the DPA recently), and I&#8217;d be curious if there are any tucked away old laws that basically say some form of, &#8220;If you offer services to the public, you can&#8217;t uniquely discriminate against the government on terms that aren&#8217;t applied to others [or maybe are on a list of particular exceptions].&#8221; We&#8217;ll see if there are any lawyers in the White House clever enough to think of something like this, and then we&#8217;ll all turn to debating whether or not Twitter actually satisfies the details of that law. People will still discuss 1A, but I&#8217;m less convinced now than I was a week ago that 1A would prohibit the gov&#8217;t from compelling Twitter.</p>
<blockquote><p>Obscuring license plates is an issue not because the license plate is government speech, but because the government cannot function without seeing the license plate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Consider the FAIR case for a slightly different analogy to license plates. The law school argued that it was being compelled to speak, because they needed to do things like sending emails and distributing flyers about the presence of military recruiters. Roberts wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>This sort of recruiting assistance, however, is a far cry from the compelled speech in Barnette and Wooley. The Solomon Amendment, unlike the laws at issue in those cases, does not dictate the content of the speech at all, which is only “compelled” if, and to the extent, the school provides such speech for other recruiters. There is nothing in this case approaching a Government-mandated pledge or motto that the school must endorse.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think he would be amused if the law school turned around and circumvented this by &#8220;altering&#8221; their regular services. Maybe, they put up flyers that said, &#8220;NO BLOOD FOR OIL&#8221; in gigantic print and, &#8220;Military recruiter will be in Room 110 at 3p on Sunday,&#8221; in imperceptibly tiny print. But as before, that would again probably end up going back to the text of the statute and determining whether it was impermissible according to the statute. And if the gov&#8217;t said, &#8220;No, you can&#8217;t do that; you can put up a flyer next to it, though,&#8221; I don&#8217;t think 1A would prohibit it. That&#8217;s a compromise more similar to, &#8220;You can&#8217;t amend his tweet, but you can write a reply tweet.&#8221;</p>

<p>I think Matt or Conrad (I can&#8217;t remember which; sorry guys that you get lumped in as &#8220;the Trumpies&#8221; and I don&#8217;t always remember who said what) has been here beating the &#8220;fraud&#8221; drum. Basically, they say they&#8217;re offering a service. In that service, they take your tweet and distribute it to your followers. They&#8217;ve continued to perform this service reliably for a very many people for a very long time. Long enough that the Second Circuit has established that the first part of the process is &#8220;government speech&#8221; and that the subsequent part (replies, etc.) is a &#8220;public forum&#8221;. The Second Circuit basically said to Trump, &#8220;Since you established it that way by your past practice, you can&#8217;t change the terms of the deal now.&#8221; Twitter is trying to say, &#8220;I have altered the deal; pray I do not alter it further.&#8221; And they&#8217;re doing it selectively; not for all of their users. (I know, I know, they&#8217;re going to say, &#8220;Actually, we reserve the right to fact check <i>all</i> of our users,&#8221; as if a company saying, &#8220;Actually, we reserve the right to refuse service to <i>all</i> of our customers,&#8221; legitimates them singling out black people.)</p>
<p>And that, well&#8230; in an idealized setting, I see why they should be able to do that, kinda. I can also see why folks like Matt/Conrad want to say, &#8220;No, we didn&#8217;t explicitly pay you money, but we all know that our using the system compensated you, and we did so under these expectations.&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure I can think of an analogy at all, because services-not-directly-compensated is quite a weird phenomenon.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s Matt&#8217;s line. I don&#8217;t necessarily disagree, but I also don&#8217;t care. I&#8217;m not a libertarian and don&#8217;t have a moral objection to government regulation, so I don&#8217;t need a &#8220;no fraud&#8221; violation of the NAP to be all right with telling private companies to shape up. Also, Matt&#8217;s not really a Trumpist. I think he supports Trump because Trump sticks it to his enemies, but isn&#8217;t really aligned with many of Trump&#8217;s policies, per se.</p>
<p>ETA: Just my attempt to take the Matt M Ideological Turing Test. Not intended to actually speak for Matt M.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>IANAL but this seems crazy to me. I can understand a case for compelling publication of official government business &#8211; e.g. if the DOJ had a Twitter account that it used for official announcements and where the tweets underwent some sort of process. And Trump announcing a policy decision on Twitter seems like government speech.</p>
<p>But Trump accusing Joe Scarborough of murdering an intern isn&#8217;t government speech. Trump launching personal attacks on political opponents isn&#8217;t government speech, or at least, it shouldn&#8217;t be.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Matt, yes. This is what I&#8217;m riffing off of. A longer quote from the Second Circuit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>    Under the government speech doctrine, &#8220;[t]he Free Speech Clause does not require government to maintain viewpoint neutrality when its officers and employees speak&#8221; about governmental endeavors. For example, when the government wishes to promote a war effort, it is not required by the First Amendment to also distribute messages discouraging that effort.</p>
<p>    It is clear that if President Trump were engaging in government speech when he blocked the Individual Plaintiffs, he would not have been violating the First Amendment. Everyone concedes that the President&#8217;s initial tweets (meaning those that he produces himself) are government speech. But this case does not turn on the President&#8217;s initial tweets; it turns on his supervision of the interactive features of the Account. The government has conceded that the Account &#8220;is generally accessible to the public at large without regard to political affiliation or any other limiting criteria,&#8221; and the President has not attempted to limit the Account&#8217;s interactive feature to his own speech.</p>
<p>    Considering the interactive features, the speech in question is that of multiple individuals, not just the President or that of the government. When a Twitter user posts a reply to one of the President&#8217;s tweets, the message is identified as coming from that user, not from the President. There is no record evidence, and the government does not argue, that the President has attempted to exercise any control over the messages of others, except to the extent he has blocked some persons expressing viewpoints he finds distasteful. The contents of retweets, replies, likes, and mentions are controlled by the user who generates them and not by the President, except to the extent he attempts to do so by blocking. Accordingly, while the President&#8217;s tweets can accurately be described as government speech, the retweets, replies, and likes of other users in response to his tweets are not government speech under any formulation. The Supreme Court has described the government speech doctrine as &#8220;susceptible to dangerous misuse.&#8221; It has urged &#8220;great caution&#8221; to prevent the government from &#8220;silenc[ing] or muffl[ing] the expression of disfavored viewpoints&#8221; under the guise of the government speech doctrine. Extension of the doctrine in the way urged by President Trump would produce precisely that result.</p></blockquote>
<p>Chalid, notice the only qualifier the Second Circuit put on what was government speech was the tweets &#8220;he produces himself&#8221;. This is because they need the proper scoping unit to be <i>the Account</i>, and not each individual tweet. They needed this in order to say that <i>the Account</i> was considered a public forum. As soon as you cut to a smaller scoping unit, I have no idea what would occur.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You are arguing that the 1st Amendment may not prohibit Trump from ordering Twitter to publish his tweets without fact checks. But does he have any grounds for ordering it, without a new law at the minimum?</p>
<p>Also, that the 1st Amendment doesn&#8217;t require government speech to be viewpoint neutral is a different question from whether ordering Twitter to display the tweets without fact checks infringes on <i>Twitter&#8217;s</i> freedom of speech, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>I spoke a little about that <a rel="nofollow"href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/05/27/open-thread-154-75/#comment-904633">here</a>. Nothing comes to my mind, right now.</p>
<blockquote><p>that the 1st Amendment doesn’t require government speech to be viewpoint neutral is a different question from whether ordering Twitter to display the tweets without fact checks infringes on Twitter’s freedom of speech, isn’t it?</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes. But once the government speech is established (even if not viewpoint neutral), then it may alter the question of how Twitter&#8217;s freedom of speech works. One of those, &#8220;You can counter-speak, but you can&#8217;t disrupt my freedom of speech,&#8221; type deals. Once the government gets to speak with license plates or flyers announcing recruiting, it somewhat limits the types of things you can do to disrupt that speech.</p>

<p>When I want to broadcast my ideas to the internet I write blog posts. Also works great and is perfectly viable. If I had a smartphone I could do it just as easily as sending a Tweet is (in my second-hand understanding).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>How plague can ruin your schooling:<br />
Nostradamus entered the University of Avignon at age 14 but was forced to leave after a year because the university shut down in response to bubonic plague. 15-year-old Michel learned apothecary skills and supported himself trying to heal people. It wasn&#8217;t until the age of 25 that he got the opportunity to enter the University of Montpellier, where he planned to study for a doctorate in medicine. He was expelled by the student procurator, Guillaume Rondelet, when it was discovered that he had been an apothecary, a manual trade expressly banned by the university statutes.</p>
<p>Unrelated fun fact: it&#8217;s popularly assumed that Nostradamus had to fear the Inquisition for composing predictive quatrains. In fact, he was a devout Catholic &#8211; he shunned the Protestant Reformation raging in France during his lifetime &#8211; and astrology was so far from being a crime that there were professionals such as Laurens Videl <i>who denounced him for incompetent astrology</i>.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>As a teenager, I was creeped out by this Nostradamus quatrain ostensibly about Henry II:</p>
<p>The young lion will overcome the older one,<br />
On the field of combat in a single battle;<br />
He will pierce his eyes through a golden cage,<br />
Two wounds made one, then he dies a cruel death.</p>
<p>&#8230;but the source failed to mention that (according to the few seconds of research I just conducted) it only appeared in print 50 years after the event.</p>
<p>I was also fascinated by Erich von Daniken&#8217;s oeuvre, if that counts for anything.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>So I bought a bass, practice amp, cable, gig bag and strap for ~$100, new, from a budget internet-only brand. To put this into some perspective, Fender&#8217;s budget brand equivilent would be this squier kit,, at three times the price; they generally of Chinese make and have a mixed reputation. My hopes were limited to &#8220;have a bass for my son to learn on and me to mess around on&#8221;. For reference, I&#8217;ve been playing bass since I was 16, but not much in the last 4-5 years. I&#8217;ve had nice basses and shitty basses during that time; I&#8217;m fairly familiar with what makes a good, playable electric instrument.</p>
<p>Surprisingly the bass is fine, bordering on pretty damn good; the fit and finish are great, there are no glaring problems with the woodwork or assembly, and it&#8217;s overall very workable. Fretboards are usually the easiest thing to be fucked up in this process in my experience, and the frets are all cut and fit well.</p>
<p>The only two flaws with the bass that I can find are that it was completely unshielded, which is/was fixable in about a half hour with some copper tape and a soldering iron and that the setup was pretty abysmal. I don&#8217;t know enough about Squiers to know if they are generally well shielded, but I&#8217;ve played enough at guitar stores over the years to know they aren&#8217;t generally set up any better than a Walmart bicycle at Christmas.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting here to me is that it seems a lot like the Fender name/coolness factor is, even diminished by the &#8220;first instrument&#8221; line status applied to Squier, worth somewhat over 200% of the actual cost of a similar instrument. Once you discount that, you can cut the cost of seeing if you really want to learn guitar/bass down by 2/3rds; if you wanted to supply a school with ten such setups you could do so for &lt;$1200, which seems like a pretty good value on charity for an art-minded person.</p>
<p>This might not be as interesting to someone else, but I&#039;m struck by it; when I got my first bass and amp at 16, it was around $180-200 for a lesser quality setup(and those are 2001 dollars). I was just barely able to talk my dad into it at that alredy-pretty low I can see a plausible world where if A. It becomes known that budget-instrument prices are potentially down to a day&#039;s minimum wage pay and B. Those same savings end up transferring over to more complex instruments/difficult to build instruments (violins, drums) we end up in a world with slightly more discovered music talent. I&#039;m a fan.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>This is very true. When I was growing up and learning violin I remember it being the case that even a &#8216;cheap&#8217; violin cost many hundreds of dollars, and was likely to be so terrible it would need to be replaced with a more expensive one as soon as the student was proficient enough to hit the limitations of the cheap instrument.</p>
<p>Now around 20 years after I was first learning, you can buy very cheap violins online for students that are actually not bad at all. The tone isn&#8217;t amazing but it&#8217;s completely fine. Just another thing to add to Gwern&#8217;s list of things that are getting better.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>What&#8217;s the name of the brand? Link? I&#8217;ve been thinking about buying a bass. I play banjo, and I&#8217;ve been sort of learning electric guitar along with my son who&#8217;s taking lessons, and I thought it would be neat to learn a bit on the bass to accompany him. It would probably be easier to find good music to do that with on a bass than my banjo.</p>
<p>Also, does anyone have a good recommendation for an online bass course? For a lot of my banjo arrangements I subscribe to <a rel="nofollow"href="https://banjobenclark.com/" rel="nofollow ugc">Banjo Ben Clark</a>. Is there anybody like that for bass?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The name of the brand is <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.glarrymusic.com/bass-guitars-c-35.html" rel="nofollow ugc">Glarry</a>. Ignore the terrible writing, they are pretty good.</p>
<p>If it were me (and it was!) I&#8217;d opt for a p-bass type instead of a j-bass type &#8211; it&#8217;s a rounder/bassier sound and there&#8217;s less moving parts if you decide to do upgrades later.</p>
<p>I mentioned this a bit in my post before, but this deal is a LOT better if you are able to do basic set-up tasks &#8211; truss rod adjustments, bridge adjustments/intonation, shielding. It&#8217;s playable out the of the box, but much better if it&#8217;s well adjusted. This is true of basically every budget brand, so if you can&#8217;t do that stuff you might consider getting it set up professionally. It&#8217;s pretty simple to learn how to do, anyway.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think the only right answer for this is that it&#8217;s probably the easiest instrument to learn to an acceptable beginner level, and then the sky is the limit for difficulty.</p>
<p>Using rock/pop as an example:</p>
<p>Say someone&#8217;s playing a 1-3-5 progression in Gmaj; Two measures on Gmaj, one on Bm, and one on Dmaj. The very, very basic method here is just to stay on the root note &#8211; you could literally do a whole note G, whole note G, whole note B, whole note D and it would sound OK. It wouldn&#8217;t be very interesting, but OK sounding none-the-less. The audience might not be wowed, but it won&#8217;t sound &#8220;wrong&#8221;. You could realistically learn to do this in ten minutes.</p>
<p>Then you have complexity that can be added in. During each of those chords, every note within the key of Gmaj is potentially OK to play (usually still starting with the root on the 1 beat and moving on from there. Similarly, every note within each of the corresponding keys to each chord is potentially fine, especially the arpeggio notes. Choosing what notes work where is a matter of taste and experience.</p>
<p>And then those rules can be stretched or broken &#8211; it&#8217;s not at all unusual to see out-of-key notes or chromatic runs in blues bass, for instance. But you have to know what&#8217;s right to do what&#8217;s wrong correctly, if that makes sense. Look up &#8220;Victor Wooten playing the wrong notes&#8221; for an example of this done at a master level.</p>
<p>On the rhythmic side, you are also interacting with the drummer as the intermediary between him and the rest of the band; you translate for him &gt; band, and also for rhythm &gt; audience. Sometimes this is easy &#8211; basic punk is just eighth note root notes, for instance. Sometimes, say in funk, this is really complex; you have to fill up the space in the beat that&#8217;s yours in such a way that it accents everyone else while also being in large part the most important part of how the band sounds to the audience (funk being a bass heavy genre). Again, experience and taste drive this; there&#8217;s only so far knowledge takes you, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>The good news here is you can take it as far as you want to &#8211; the barrier for entry is very low, improvements up to the intermediate level are pretty easy to get, and the advanced stuff is incredibly fun. Definitely watch some videos on good technique first &#8211; efficiency goes a long way, and it&#8217;s a big instrument so making sure your hands are right is vital if you don&#8217;t want to get bogged down.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Ha, I love that you mention Victor Wooten. He&#8217;s the bassist for Bela Fleck and the Flecktones. Bela is the world&#8217;s greatest banjo player, and the one who inspired me to start playing banjo 20-odd years ago. </p>

<p>This is legitmately a worthy use of time even if a person didn&#8217;t like music; he&#8217;s just a master of what he does and it&#8217;s rewarding to watch.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thanks for your serious answer, in retrospect I should have asked this question in a more nuanced way than “is it easy.” Maybe, “How wide is the skill gap between picking it up and having fun?”</p></blockquote>
<p>Old bass joke time! </p>
<p>A 12-year-old boy expresses an interest in music to his father. His dad takes him to the music store and buys him a bass, an amp, and a certificate for 10 bass lessons. On monday, the boy goes to his first lesson. </p>
<p>When he comes home, the dad asks him how it went. &#8220;Great, dad! I learned the first five notes on the &#8220;E&#8221; string!. He goes on Tuesday, comes home, the dad asks again, the kid goes &#8220;Great, dad! I learned the first five notes on the &#8220;A&#8221; string!&#8221;</p>
<p>The next day the child does not return home from his bass lesson. The dad calls the cops, they look, nothing. Finally, at 4 AM, the kid stumbles in smelling of booze, cheap women and cigarettes. &#8220;How did your bass lesson go, son?&#8221; the father asks. &#8220;Sorry, pops &#8211; had to blow that off. I had a gig!&#8221;.</p>
<p>One nice thing about bass is that this isn&#8217;t 100% implausible &#8211; I&#8217;ve read multiple stories from famous bass players where their bass journey started with something like &#8220;my uncle had a jazz band and the bass player left, and he needed somebody for that night, so he got me up to speed real quick and I never stopped playing after that&#8221;. Which is great!</p>
<p>As for the gap between picking it up and having fun, that&#8217;s exactly why God invented the smoke on the water bassline.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s interesting that we are opposites on this &#8211; I know and like Bela because of Wooten, who I in turn know mostly as a bass soloist.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I heard that joke as Little Johnny takes tuba lessons, the first lesson he learns the note F, the 2nd he learns C, then he&#8217;s gigging.<br />
What I&#8217;ve actually seen is that the ratio of demand to supply is greatest for bass players (at least for classical, rock and folk, would expect similar for other genres). Flute players and guitarists are a dime a dozen, bass players are a quarter each. 😉</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Can confirm. Just got home from the music store with my new bass guitar, watched a youtube video on &#8220;best bass lines for beginners,&#8221; booked three gigs. </p>
<p>Seriously, though, it&#8217;s pretty cool. The time between &#8220;first pick up a bass&#8221; and &#8220;can play something that sounds like a rock song&#8221; is about 15 minutes.</p>
<p>I think I have a shielding issue, though, so I need to fix that.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>So the gsr200b has a couple interesting things about it you want to consider before you start shielding:</p>
<p>1. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a two pickup bass with two different pickups, one of which is a single coil. Single coil pickups buzz all by themselves, especially if they are cheaply made (which all pickups at the general 0-500 range sort of are). </p>
<p>So the first thing you want to do is dial out the bridge pickup and see if it&#8217;s still buzzing as much.<br />
Some of the buzz that goes away when you dial out this pickup is a separate problem shielding won&#8217;t fix.</p>
<p>Since you said it goes away when you touch it, this is probably not going to go away just because that pickup is off; single coil buzz is an &#8220;always on&#8221; problem whether or not you are touching the bass.</p>
<p>2. </p>
<p>If I&#8217;m reading this correctly, your bass is equipped with active electronics; this makes the job a little bit more of a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>What you probably have is four distinct cavities: a battery holder cavity, an electronics cavity, and two cavities in which the pickups sit. You can shield any combination of these, but to do it &#8220;complete&#8221; is a little more work than it would be on mine, where there&#8217;s just one big cavity up front. Any shielding is better than non-shielding, so how much you do is up to you.</p>
<p><b>Instructions</b></p>
<p>So to shield this, you have two official options: copper tape, or shielding paint. Copper tape works better/is cheaper, so I&#8217;d recommend that. I bought <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07C6YLNYL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_image_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" rel="nofollow ugc">this.</a>, which is probably 2x-3x how much you need for this job.</p>
<p>What you are trying to do is tape the entire inside of every cavity and bring all the tape back to ground. The adhesive is conductive, so anywhere the tape overlaps is continuous.</p>
<p><b>Specific instructions for your bass:</b></p>
<p>You have four cavities. Starting up front, you have two pickup cavities; gently and carefully unscrew the pickups, which will lift out still connected to their wires. You would then cut strips of tape to fit the cavities. Once the tape is in place, you&#8217;d either </p>
<p>A. cut into the ground from the pickups and ground each cavity to that </p>
<p>or B. Run a jumper from the tape to the main control cavity around the back. I&#8217;d do B, since it avoids potentially fucking the pickups.</p>
<p>Now moving around the back, you&#8217;d shield the battery cavity &#8211; I don&#8217;t think you have to do anything besides remove the battery cover to get to it. You are taping both the inside of the cover and the cavity here. Lay the tape in such a way that the tape coming from the cavity and the tape on the inside side of the battery cavity cover will overlap when it&#8217;s screwed back on; this makes a electronically continuous bubble around the entire cavity.</p>
<p>Run a jumper from the copper tape to the main cavity or to the 9v connector ground; you might actually be able to just cram it in between the battery ground and the connector if you feel lazy here. </p>
<p>Now in the main cavity, I&#8217;m assuming you are going to open it up and find there&#8217;s a circuit board encased in hot-glue which is in turn connected to the knobs(by wire and probably by glue), the output jack(by wire), and the pickups (by wire). </p>
<p>We are praying this is not actually glued to the body. If it is, we can still shield everything it&#8217;s not covering, or we can try to remove it somehow, but these are judgement calls you&#8217;d need to make. Some shielding is a lot better than none shielding.</p>
<p>What you&#8217;d do here is first remove the knob-covers; they are either slide on (I.E. pull-off) or have an allen screw clamping them on, which you&#8217;d be able to see on the side of each knob. Loosen the screw if present, pull off the covers. </p>
<p>You are now looking at four metal posts. At the base of each post is a nut. Remove the nut. The knobs should now be freed.</p>
<p>If the output jack is glued to the circuit board, you need to remove that; there&#8217;s a set nut on it, likely. Remove that; that should be all you have to do. If it&#8217;s still not free, there might be a plate that needs to be unscrewed.</p>
<p>Now we (fucking gently) lift the circuit board and can tape underneath it. Don&#8217;t force anything. As before, tape the inside of this in such a way that the tape you&#8217;ve lined the cavity cover with is continuous with the tape inside the cavity.</p>
<p>At this point, you have as many as 3 jumpers coming from various cavities to the main cavity. Solder them to the copper tape in the cavity. This connects all the taped areas. Now solder the main cavity tape to ground.</p>
<p>Reassemble bass.</p>
<p>Advanced options:</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to run a jumper, you could make a tube out of tape roughly the size of the tunnels going from each cavity to the next, cut a slot in it so you can get it around the wires, and run it from cavity to cavity. Make sure it&#8217;s well-adhered to the tape on both cavity walls to ensure continuity. This has the added bonus of shielding those tunnels and the wires in them as well.</p>
<p>The bridge is also (probably) connected to a wire that goes back (probably) to the main electronics cavity. You could run a copper tube up that from the cavity &#8212;&gt; bridge direction without removing the bridge, if you wanted to.</p>
<p>One final note: The pickups on that bass are relatively budget-friendly, so they probably aren&#8217;t themselves the best shielded ever. Shielding everything else might only do 90% of the job; it would be a ton better, in any case, but if you&#8217;ve done everything else here and there&#8217;s still some (minor) buzz remaining, it might be something you&#8217;d just live with at that point.</p>
<p>Sorry if this got long. Your bass has a lot more steps to shield than my bass, which is &#8220;remove pickguard; shield cavity and pickguard and ground&#8221;. If you want a much simpler version of this, I&#8217;d start out just shielding the main electronics cavity and see if that doesn&#8217;t fix it before moving on to the other cavities.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>What kind of jumper to do you mean? Like, a piece of the copper tape, or something more specific..?</p></blockquote>
<p>The best version of this would be to roll the copper tape around an allen wrench or screw driver of the appropriate size, cut a slit length-ways down the tube so it can slip over the wire, and put it through the tunnel &#8211; best only because it shields that length of wire. Then you&#8217;d use a bit of copper tape to tape it down to the other copper tape. </p>
<p>Edit: If you were good enough with an iron to de-solder the pickup wires, there&#8217;s really no reason you couldn&#8217;t just directly wrap the wires themselves and stick them back through. I&#8217;m not generally good enough that I try to solder if I don&#8217;t have to, though.</p>
<p>Second best and potentially easier/more stable if you are any good with a soldering iron would be any copper wire you have laying around. It&#8217;s going to do just as good of a job connecting the two areas, it&#8217;s just not providing 360 protection to the other wire.</p>
<blockquote><p>ETA: Any idea why they don’t just do this at the factory? I mean, I get that it’s a cheap bass, but still, some copper tape costs pennies…</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how true this is is <i>today</i>, but I think when I was a kid even Fender&#8217;s nicer stuff only used the shielding paint at the factory, which is slightly-to-noticeably-worse than the tape. This indicates to me that it&#8217;s probably an issue of labor; I guess that makes sense since you&#8217;d have to paint the body, wait, and paint it again before you could send it down the line.</p>
<p>Another thing is that cheap pickups tend to be themselves poorly shielded, so it&#8217;s probably not going to solve 100% of the hum like I said before. Maybe at that point it&#8217;s not considered with the effort? It&#8217;s my understanding you can take them apart and shield them, but I haven&#8217;t done it. </p>
<p>The last possibility is that they did do this, but for some reason it&#8217;s not working well; like maybe they did the wood but not the plastic covers. Or maybe the bridge-ground isn&#8217;t making incredible contact, something like that.</p>
<p>My current experience with electric instruments is that 95% of everything you need them to be is cheap &#8211; it has a neck and body and electronics that all work pretty well and it&#8217;s usable for 100-400 bucks, new. That last 5% is nice, but it&#8217;s super expensive &#8211; want your pickups and electronics to sound 10% better? <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/11402-58--seymour-duncan-rex-brown-signature-p-j-bass-pickup-and-preamp-set?mrkgadid=3247037209&amp;mrkgcl=28&amp;mrkgen=gpla&amp;mrkgbflag=0&amp;mrkgcat=bass&amp;&amp;acctid=21700000001645388&amp;dskeywordid=92700046938734062&amp;lid=92700046938734062&amp;ds_s_kwgid=58700005287622256&amp;ds_s_inventory_feed_id=97700000007215323&amp;dsproductgroupid=371204331723&amp;product_id=11402-58&amp;prodctry=US&amp;prodlang=en&amp;channel=online&amp;storeid=&amp;device=c&amp;network=g&amp;matchtype=&amp;locationid=9061152&amp;creative=226299461027&amp;targetid=aud-561690807355:pla-371204331723&amp;campaignid=953755101&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwiMj2BRBFEiwAYfTbCjSTFHx9isXtL2NgIR3AkKp2dki5Jm4NNRw6qHRBSZFShzvrcgrQ5hoCRJYQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" rel="nofollow ugc">Seymour Duncan</a> has you covered for the entire purchase price of the bass you just bought. The best bridge ever made by the hands of a man helps your sustain only slightly, <a rel="nofollow"href="https://g-l-online-store.myshopify.com/collections/bridges/products/g-l-saddle-lock-bass-bridge-4-string" rel="nofollow ugc">but it&#8217;s $80.</a></p>
<p>So it&#8217;s possible that shielding is something that makes your instrument sound better and is held back as one of those premium options &#8211; like, Fender ultimately wants you to buy a MIA instrument for $1500; they have to have things to hold back to make that seem worth it to us. Maybe this is one of those?</p>
<p>By the way, and I didn&#8217;t say this before, I think you made a good decision on Ibanez. While for some arbitrary stupid reason I&#8217;ve never loved how they look, objectively they look fine and are significantly more bass than fender at a similar price point.</p>

<p>In answer to your second question, yes. Solar and wind enthusiasts will also enthuse about how the price of batteries is plummeting, and therefore the intermittency of their cherished renewables is at the point of, very nearly, and just about to be solved. The only problem is the three orders of magnitude difference between battery capacities and the storage required to keep an electricity grid functioning if it is run on renewable energy. And I don’t think this is going to be solved any decade soon with any battery technology existing or proposed.</p>

<p>I really can’t see batteries filling more than niche applications anytime soon. Pumped storage where it’s applicable can be a real boon to renewables but the topographic opportunities are few and far between, to say the least.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Music separates generations. There&#8217;s  what music was popular when you were 14 1/2, but there&#8217;s also the older music you got into, which also seems to be generational. I got really into jazz as a teenager, and then got into classical music when I was about 30. I lost interest in much new pop in my early 20&#8217;s ,although there were a few exceptions like Beck and Amy Winehouse. </p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to see a graph of when tastes for various old music falls off, by age and by country. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m a snob who thinks, in general, classical and jazz music are better than pop, and the increase in pop musiice fandom at the expsense of  love of classical represents a decline in culture, a preference for ugliness over beauty.</p>
<p>An interesting thing about this argument is it&#8217;s not a culture war. Conservatives used to stake a claim for high culture but if anything this has been reversed in recent decades.</p>

<p>I think this last bolded section is what you would want to focus on if you were trying to find the flaw in your motivations. There&#8217;s certainly good and bad pop music; at the same time, there&#8217;s shitty classical even among the stuff that managed to survive the centuries. If you want to find shitty Jazz, it&#8217;s not hard; 90% of fusion fits that bill (I say this at the same time as having being a pretty big Jaco fan, when I still listened to appreciable amounts of music).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty uncharitable to say something like you did &#8211; it&#8217;s essentially accusing people who enjoy pop all of having shitty taste, or of pretending to like something they don&#8217;t enjoy for unknown reasons. But that&#8217;s a huge amount of people to accuse of having bad taste or being liars &#8211; is it more likely to think most of everybody listening to music has bad taste, or that you have unusual niche taste? Is it more likely that world class musicians and engineers with good equipment and budgets are making bad music, or that you&#8217;ve zeroed in on one quality of music (likely complexity) as the only worthwhile value to be found in an entire art form?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I was thinking about this today. My taste at 14 was slightly different from now (I&#8217;m well over twice that age) but only because I&#8217;ve discovered a lot more. There&#8217;s nothing I liked then that I would now be mortified to admit having liked, even if some of my favorite stuff from then is no longer my favorite now. Some of my favorite CDs are the ones I&#8217;ve had the longest.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ve had the opposite evolution. I listened almost exclusively to classical (though more Romantic, Impressionist and early 20th century) in my teens and slowly grew to appreciate modern music more. First modern contemporary, but now more modern electronic music.</p>
<p>Hot take, but I think that snobs who think classical is &#8220;better&#8221; than modern music don&#8217;t really understand modern music at all. Classical music is based off harmonic complexity. The interactions between notes create the structure of the music. But modern music is based off of complexity in timbre. Whereas 19th century composers had a limited set of instruments to work with, modern composers can create a much wider variety of sounds. And they can layer them to a much greater extent than was previously possible. The two types of complexity create effects that the other can&#8217;t replicate but neither is superior, merely different. Take for instance <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI7XiJgt0vY" rel="nofollow ugc">Eruption</a>. If you turned that into a piano piece, it would lose all of the nuances that Van Halen creates by changing the parameters of his electric guitar. It&#8217;s because of timbal complexity that you have one of the most famous guitars solos ever.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Classical is also Western-centric. None of the operas or ballets I&#8217;ve been listening to have the kinds of rhythms that you get from Africa or South America unless they&#8217;re explicitly influenced by them, and that&#8217;s a huge paucity. Even modern operas with (modern) jazz influences will never be funky. </p>
<p>In fact, most people would say that contemporary classical far more values ugliness over beauty, the way much of modern abstract art defines itself by how it &#8220;challenges&#8221; notions of what is beauty. Contemporary classical has commonly gone up its ass about concepts around repetition and space and such, while EDM and hip-hop explore those same concepts just fine without losing accessibility to the layman. </p>
<p>And more damningly, any binary of quality constructed around classical vs. non-classical seems to be only on the part of supposed classical listeners. Actual classical composers and musicians/artists are often all about exploring and praising other genres. There is no &#8220;at the expense of love of classical,&#8221; other than self-inflicted wounds by classical music culture, which is why the most lucrative gigs for orchestras now are often about playing film and video game music to enthusiastic crowds that are far different from their usual audiences, owning music libraries spanning all genres.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m an outlier, but I&#8217;ve preferred classical since I was a child in Canada, and am now 62 and living in the US. I also liked some folk music (less so in adulthood), and most electronic music (still).</p>
<p>At a more nuanced level, my tastes do not correlate very strongly with the way music is categorized. I have encountered something I liked in just about any genre, but the chances of me finding e.g. a rock piece that I like are much lower than the chances of me finding an electronic or classical piece I like.</p>
<p>Current ways of delivering music leave me with access only to classical &#8211; I preferred having a good source of classical music to a more generic music source, and also figured that one music streaming services was enough.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Not many listen to jazz in their teens. That&#8217;s when you learn the basics of music, and that&#8217;s easier with the simple (catchy) melodies  and harmonies of pop music. To appreciate jazz, you need to understand how it plays with and deviates from the basic. Classical music is between pop and jazz in complexity, and the natural progression should be to expand from pop/rock to classical to jazz.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;God&#8221; in Sanskrit Philosophy: Defining the Terms.<br />
Copied from a conversation I had elsewhere online.</p>
<p>1a) <b>Brahman</b>, the Supreme Being (<b>Saguna Brahman</b>) or impersonal ground of being (<b>Nirguna Brahman</b>).<br />
1b) <b>Brahma</b>, a person who created the universe.<br />
2) <b>Bhagvan</b>, a personal God, actually used in colloquial speech (most commonly understood by the speaker as Vishnu OR Shiva). The etymology is an Indo-European root, <i>Bhag-</i>, cognate to Common Slavic <i>Bog</i>, used for Slavic Pagan gods.<br />
3) <b>Ishvara</b>, the Supreme Being (see 1a), a personal God, used in philosophy texts debating Indian atheists and pantheists. Also has connotations of &#8220;Lord&#8221; or &#8220;king&#8221;&#8230; just like English &#8220;Lord&#8221;. Asserting the logic of belief in Ishvara would form the philosophical justification for choosing a personal God, commonly Vishnu or Shiva (who is then identified as Ishvara, Brahman, while the other&#8230; isn&#8217;t).</p>
<p>Note that the Upanishads, post-Bronze Age philosophical appendices to the Vedas, four Bronze Age collections of hymns, purport that Atman, a term meaning one&#8217;s real Self as opposed to a purported identity error like &#8220;I am this body&#8221;, is Brahman. Accepting the authority of the Upanishads and the rest of the Vedas is a non-negotiable part of Hinduism. However, Hindus can be monotheists or atheists rather than pantheists. Meanwhile a key Buddhist truth claim is <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta" rel="nofollow ugc">anatman.</a></p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>In 1921 the Hatfields fought someone who weren&#8217;t McCoy&#8217;s, trenches were dug, homemade bombs were dropped from airplanes and trains were fitted with machine guns against American citizens in West Virginia in what would be eventually known as the Coal Wars.<br />

I&#8217;m continuing my project of looking up and putting together the most interesting bits I can find about Appalachian Mining communities. Though I try to focus on my home state of Kentucky, this time we slide over into West Virginia because it&#8217;s impossible to skip the Coal Wars. The Battle of Blair mountain remains the largest armed insurrection and battle that has taken place on American soil since the Civil war. This is just the tip of the iceberg, there is a lot to find about the Coal Wars and other uprisings around this time.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Right. The main battle is to avenge a Hatfield and the preceding one was pacified by a different Hatfield, but they aren’t really the center of the story. It’s just a fun coincidence.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The original Hatfield-McCoy feud wasn&#8217;t massive — that&#8217;s mostly newspaper hype.</p>
<p>Three McCoys got in a fight with Ellison Hatfield at an election-day party, shooting and stabbing him. His kinsmen siezed the three, waited to see if the injured man would die, and when he did executed the three.</p>
<p>Five years passed with no further violence between the families. Then a new governor of Kentucky was elected who was a friend of Perry Cline, a distant relative of Ranel McCoy who had a grudge against Anse Hatfield over a lawsuit some years earlier. He persuaded the governor to announce rewards for the Hatfields responsible for the killing. While the governor of West Virginia, where the Hatfields were, was still considering the request for extradition, a Kentucky posse crossed into West Virginia and captured one of the people on the Hatfield side (whose name happened to be McCoy — it wasn&#8217;t as straightforward a family vs family conflict as the usual story makes it sound). That set off the second round of conflict. Two McCoys were killed by Hatfield supporters. The rest of the conflict was basically West Virginia posses vs Kentucky posses, most of the people having no connection with either family. The conflict eventually reached the Supreme Court, which held that the initial crossing into West Virginia and capture thereafter of various people was illegal but that there was no remedy, since once they were in Kentucky a Kentucky court could try them.</p>
<p>Altogether, four people were killed in the original conflict. After it was revived by the state of Kentucky, two more were killed in conflict between members of the families, two people, one a Hatfield, were killed by Kentucky posses and one Hatfield condemned to hang by a Kentucky Court.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I know, nothing is like you think it is!! That’s a pretty effective, succinct overview. Though I’ve read that the initial conflict was over a civil war grudge, where one member fought for the north and the other the south? I bet the real cause is lost to legend now.<br />
Public obsession and it’s growth into something much much larger might be the most interesting element of the Hatfields and McCoys.</p>

<p><b>Questions raised over hydroxychloroquine study which caused WHO to halt trials for Covid-19</b></p>
<p>&#8220;Guardian Australia also contacted the health departments of Australia’s two most populous states, New South Wales and Victoria, which have had by far the largest number of Covid-19 infections between them. Of the Australian deaths reported by 21 April, 14 were in Victoria and 26 in NSW.</p>
<p>Victoria’s department confirmed the study’s results relating to the Australian data did not reconcile with the state’s coronavirus data, including hospital admissions and deaths. The NSW Department of Health also confirmed it did not provide the researchers with the data for its databases.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>To be honest they should never have started trials based on the data they had at the time. If the concern is over scientific rigour that is where the most grevious error has been made.</p>
<p>The way the error has been made in that study is actually likely to push the data more in favour of the against column if it does change anything, although the n change is so small it&#8217;s unlikley to do anything. The error is interesting in that it&#8217;s the hospital that&#8217;s self reported it&#8217;s location incorrectly, but an argument could be made the error is on the database side for the rather ambiguous &#8216;Australasia&#8217; designator. Not the most ideal source, as they point out, but likely one of the best if speed is one of the major concerns.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I have seen the term &#8220;Deep State&#8221; tossed around a couple of times lately, including in at least one thread below.  In general, I despise politics and seldom delve too deeply into its terminology, but I am curious about this one.  What does &#8220;Deep State&#8221; represent?  Is it the idea that there is a shadow conspiracy that runs the country, as a modern-day Illuminati or something?</p>

<p>The <i>surprisingly large, expansive, and mostly invisible</i> un-elected bureaucratic infrastructure, to be specific, and it tends to refer to the infrastructure that supports the federal government rather than that which supports the lower levels. A clerk at your local sewer and water department is not part of the deep state, but a clerk at your local EPA office is.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Deep State is typically used to refer to the bureaucrats who staff Federal agencies and remain in place from administration to administration. The idea is that we elect the State (Congress, President, etc) but that most of the actual running of government is done by career bureaucrats and that these people have a lot of power even though they were never elected. So if someone says the Deep State is opposing Trump, they mean that the bureaucracy is opposed to Trump. Like individual FBI agents and management, or the FDA or whatever.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>And the part that doesn&#8217;t tends to run establishment Republican.</p>
<p>@Silverlock</p>
<p>The Deep State is not generally self-aware, although I do think it&#8217;s become significantly more self-aware since Trump&#8217;s election.</p>
<p>The Deep State is six guys/gals with 20+ year careers in a State Department basement with Ph.D.s in Elbonian Studies arguing pointedly about whether the right amount of foreign aid to give to Elbonia is $300M or $350M a year, and the President&#8217;s job is to sagely decide it shall be $325M (congress approving, etc etc). But then Trump comes in and says &#8220;why the hell are we giving money to Elbonia? Give them $0!&#8221; This is unsettling to the Deep State because Trump is not doing his job.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The &#8220;Deep State&#8221; is Sir Humphrey Appleby and all his kin.</p>
<p>OK, the long version, starting with the unambiguously true part.  Most of what the government actually does, in every modern democracy, is done by career civil servants who expect to serve under multiple separate Democratic and Republican (or whatever) administrations and don&#8217;t much care.  They have collectively developed a strong and coherent understanding of what their job is and how it ought to be done, and they&#8217;re going to do just that.  They basically can&#8217;t be fired or punished, because we&#8217;ve learned that if you let politicians fire civil servants you find they&#8217;re all replaced by incompetent political appointees.  If you tell them to do things any differently, they&#8217;ll point to some obscure statute that says what you want them to do is <i>illegal</i>, and you&#8217;re not asking them to break the law, are you?  All the stuff they think they ought to do and actually do is just as illegal, with some obscure federal statute prohibiting it, but the guys in charge of enforcing that statute are part of the same old-boy network and they&#8217;ve all agreed on which laws will be ignored as long as things are done the way the Deep State thinks they ought to be.  The &#8220;Deep State&#8221; is inherently conservative in the literal, apolitical sense of the term, because they know a way that works and they are skeptical that anyone&#8217;s preferred different way will work &#8211; modern democratic states are <i>complicated</i>.</p>
<p>Somewhat more controversially, the elected officials have what looks like steering wheel for the ship of state, but it was disconnected years ago, and the &#8220;Deep State&#8221; basically just keeps the ship on a steady course.  If the elected officials know how the system works, and are willing to make the effort, they can negotiate or even force a course change &#8211; but it&#8217;s not easy.  If the elected officials need to appease their electoral base by posturing about Taxing the Rich or Regulating Twitter or some other damn fool thing, they can give the orders in a high-profile manner and the &#8220;Deep State&#8221; will translate them into something harmless.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the full-on conspiratorial version, where the &#8220;Deep State&#8221; is made up of partisan liberal activists who meet in smoke-filled rooms to secretly rule the world.  They work eagerly with Democratic presidents to translate their liberal agenda into policy, they tolerate RINO cuckservative Republican presidents and allow them just enough success that they can dominate the Republican party, and they deliberately actively throw monkey wrenches into anything a Real Republican(tm) might do so as to ensure that Cthulhu&#8217;s relentless leftward swim is unhindered by Real Republicans(tm).  That version does get into Illuminati territory.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The term was coined in 20th century Turkey, where coups were commonplace and everyone knew the military and intelligence services had their own agendas separate from the elected government. The Turkish Deep State is no more thanks to Erdogan&#8217;s purges, and it was much stronger and had a much more coherent ideology than anything you could point to in the West and call a Deep State.</p>

I&#8217;ve felt gaslighted being told that &#8220;Deep State&#8221; is a conspiracy theory with the standard connotations of falseness <i>et al</i> since 2016, when I first encountered the term in the Turkish context more than 15 years ago as a precociously-studying minor.</p>

<p>This is true, but it&#8217;s not the social media-level version of the conversation. Since I don&#8217;t want to weakman, let&#8217;s see <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_state" rel="nofollow ugc">what less hysterical sources say.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;In the field of political science, the normative pop culture concept of the deep state is studied within the literature on the state. Within this literature, the state is understood as both venue (a set of rules under which others act and interact) as well as actor (with its own agenda). Under this dual understanding, the conspiratorial version of the deep state concept would be one version of the &#8216;state as actor&#8217; while the non-conspiratorial version would be another version of the &#8216;state as actor.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s clear as mud. However La Wik does correctly elucidate that it&#8217;s a real thing in some times and places and was used in academia based on the Central Example of the secular Republic of Turkey.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The weak version of the Deep State isn&#8217;t a conspiracy theory; I feel that the strong version of it is.

<p>what about John Schilling&#8217;s claim &#8220;most of the time, civil servants are not effectively controllable by elected officials, their ideas about how to run the country sometimes differ from their elected officials, and they often have the power/knowledge to get their way.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The normal process of our bureaucracy is as follows:</p>
<p>1. President has a vision for some kind of policy change.<br />
2. President identifies and appoints qualified appointees to work at the various departments and agencies to carry out this vision.<br />
3. Political Appointees work with senior civil staff to transform the president&#8217;s vision into policy.<br />
4. Senior civil staff transform policy into actionable programs.<br />
5. Bureaucrats enact those programs. Once step 5 is enacted, it pretty much continues indefinitely. </p>
<p>Now, if step one happens, but steps 2-4 don&#8217;t, nothing changes. This has nothing to do with the preference of the bureaucrats to keep doing their jobs a certain way, and everything to do with the fact that you only really change what you&#8217;re doing if your boss tells you to&#8230; and their bosses haven&#8217;t.</p>

<p>that is not the normal process of bureaucracy.  that&#8217;s the ideal of how it&#8217;s supposed to work, but it doesn&#8217;t ever work that way in any bureaucracy, particularly in the federal government where the civil servants are largely unfirable, congress always has its say, and the bureaucrats and have far more tools at their disposal to frustrate their bosses than in the private sector.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Any version of the deep state which makes a more controversial claim than “People want to do the jobs for which they were hired and are paid” falls apart.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ehhhhhh I don&#8217;t know about that. What about people like Peter Strzok, who nobody hired to <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fbi-agent-strzok-reportedly-texted-well-stop-trump-from-becoming-president" rel="nofollow ugc">pick the next president</a>? </p>
<blockquote><p>
“[Trump’s] not ever going to become president, right? Right?!” Page texted Strzok.</p>
<p>“No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it,” Strzok responded.</p></blockquote>
<p>And then he set about doing shady lawfare stuff nobody hired him to do in an attempt to stop it. </p>
<p>I would prefer a different meme for this other than &#8220;Deep State.&#8221; I like the &#8220;Deep State&#8221; concept for the technocracy, or the entrenched bureaucracy.  I think it&#8217;s a little more involved than &#8220;want to do jobs for which they were hired.&#8221; I think it&#8217;s more like &#8220;people who think their job is to set the boundaries on potential policies elected officials may choose instead of implementing the policies decided by elected officials.&#8221; But beyond that, I think there <i>is</i> a conspiracy by small groups of unelected officials (Brennan, Clapper, Strzok, Page, probably Comey, etc) who abuse their power to advance the class interests of the Deep State in favor of those friendly to the Deep State (establishment Democrats and Republicans) and against those who oppose it (Trump, tea partiers, etc). </p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s fairly uncontroversially a Deep State, but the existence of self-aware members of the Deep State conspiring in its interests remains controversial.</p>
<p>ETA: Just read the next posts. Aftagley, I agree with cassander, I think your idea of how things work may be slightly naive. I think an awful lot of government bureaucrats are not interested in implementing Trump&#8217;s agenda, and think he should be taking their advice rather than giving them orders.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Well, let&#8217;s use Peter Strozk as a case example:</p>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t exactly fit the definition of a standard government bureaucrat, but it&#8217;s close enough for government work (ha). Strozk was civil servant who was found to have committed wrongdoing. Putting aside, for now, the issue of whether or not your allowed to think the guy whom your investigating for crimes is a criminal, he said/did some stuff that good judgement should have prevented him from saying/doing. After his behavior was identified it was thoroughly investigated, he was removed from his position, and then was eventually fired. In the meantime, his former work was reviewed and tested to make sure he didn&#8217;t corrupt it. That&#8217;s at least one data point against the &#8220;you can&#8217;t fire/discipline a civil servant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m not trying to say that my above-mentioned definition of bureaucracy is perfectly executed, I&#8217;ll even contend that if you staff an agency with ideologues, you constrain what kind of advice that agency can give you and future administration (for example &#8211; the EPA will likely never recommend oil drilling no matter what changes you try to make) but most of those kinds of problems have iterative solutions that can be implemented by bringing in smart and capable political appointees, keeping them in the loop and empowering them to execute your vision.  </p>
<p>These problems can&#8217;t be solved by complaining about a Deep State or Technocracy of whatever on Twitter. All complaining about it publicly does is just cast a stigma on a collection of people who are mostly just doing their job.</p>

<p>And I&#8217;ll raise you the DC metro employee who, when a fire killed a bunch of people and he got caught faking his maintenance records and literally not doing his job, he sued the city about it arguing that it was true he didn&#8217;t do his job and lied, but so did everyone else so it wasn&#8217;t fair to fire just him.  <a rel="nofollow"href="https://wtop.com/tracking-metro-24-7/2017/04/judge-orders-metro-reinstate-worker-fired-lenfant-smoke-incident/" rel="nofollow ugc">And he won</a> and got his job back.  </p>
<p>federal rules are only slightly less absurd, and protect the vast majority of employees from any meaningful accountability except in extraordinary circumstances.</p>
<blockquote><p> but most of those kinds of problems have iterative solutions that can be implemented by bringing in smart and capable political appointees, keeping them in the loop and empowering them to execute your vision.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s not an option. It takes years to get those appointments filled, and even when they are, the people in the positions almost by definition have less knowledge than civil service who have been there for years.   And those appointees can&#8217;t fire, dock the pay, or otherwise remove GS employees that dodge their mandates and try to wait them out.  and even if they could, there&#8217;s always congress, with it&#8217;s own agenda, and a budget cycles that means it&#8217;s a minimum of almost two years to accomplish almost any meaningful change.    </p>
<blockquote><p>These problems can’t be solved by complaining about a Deep State or Technocracy of whatever on Twitter.</p></blockquote>
<p>obviously. when has complaining on twitter ever solved anything?  What&#8217;s your point</p>

<p>Okay, but that&#8217;s sort of the problem with the weak-ish version of the Deep State. </p>
<p>Who gets to decide whether or not we have oil drilling? It should be the voters, right? I mean, ideally it should be whoever owns the land the oil is on but that&#8217;s sort of a different argument, especially if we&#8217;re talking about offshore drilling. Anyway, if the voters elect the guy who says &#8220;yes oiling drilling,&#8221; and then he goes to the EPA and says &#8220;approve oil drilling&#8221; and they&#8230;well, they don&#8217;t exactly say &#8220;no,&#8221; but they fight against him, or slow-walk all the paperwork and assessments and &#8220;lose&#8221; the permit applications and leak damaging stuff (true or not) to the press about what the administration is doing to turn public sentiment against them and invite lawsuits and all that to prevent the oil drilling from happening (maybe holding out for the next election or an impeachment?)&#8230;who is really in charge here? Is it the voters and their elected official, or is it a bunch of unelected and barely accountable careerists? Is that how this should work? </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it should, I prefer the thing where I get the stuff I vote for, good and hard.</p>
<p>And do you see how this example flies in the face of how you said the bureaucracy works? They&#8217;re not attempting to implement the policies of the elected officials, they&#8217;re attempting to set the policies themselves.</p>
<p>I still think it&#8217;s pretty obvious this exists or else &#8220;The Resistance&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t be thing. That&#8217;s the whole point&#8230;they Resist what the President attempts to do instead of implementing what the President attempts to do.</p>
<p>Still, though, I called this the &#8220;weak-ish&#8221; version of the Deep State. I think the true weak version of the Deep State, and the context in which I first heard the term, is when this is all invisible and amicable. Like, I don&#8217;t think much of what the Obama administration did came from Obama. I think he was a technocrat&#8217;s technocrat. If you believe in government by experts, he was your guy. I&#8217;m pretty sure most of his policies were brought to him by the experts and he approved them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that as a bad thing, I think a lot of people like that. </p>
<blockquote><p>These problems can’t be solved by complaining about a Deep State or Technocracy of whatever on Twitter. All complaining about it publicly does is just cast a stigma on a collection of people who are mostly just doing their job.</p></blockquote>
<p>Does that apply to people complaining about police conduct on the internet? Vast, vast, vast majority of cops are not out murdering unarmed black people and are just doing their job. Why bother complaining about it and stigmatizing them?</p>
<p>Still, slight difference between the police and the technocrats, an awful lot of the people &#8220;just doing their jobs&#8221; are doing jobs <i>I don&#8217;t want them to do</i>. I&#8217;m remembering now the State Department people during the impeachment trial, like Vindman, who kept going on and on about how wonderful the Ukrainian people are and how &#8220;important&#8221; their work helping them is. Some of these people I think had basically &#8220;gone native.&#8221; It was like they thought their job was to represent Ukrainian interests in the US instead of US interests in the Ukraine. Which makes sense: they care enough about Ukraine to go to work in the Ukraine division of the State Department, and if they can get more money for Ukraine from the US they get invited to all the finest cocktail parties in Kiev. Their status and prestige goes up.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t actually want them doing that job. I&#8217;m paying people so they can finagle how to extract still more resources from me to give to other people I don&#8217;t know. This is not in my interests, I do not think this is good, and I would like them to stop. </p>
<p>What I want, as Steve Bannon put it at CPAC 2017 is &#8220;the dismantlement of the administrative state.&#8221; </p>
<p>And as for the strong-ish version of the Deep State, I&#8217;m guessing you agree, since you agree that&#8217;s what Strzok was up to? There are definitely conspirators in the civil service / bureaucracy knowingly attempting to manipulate the democratic process. The only question is how many and how effective they are. For further evidence, I point to the existence of The Resistance. </p>
<p>So, no, a version of the Deep State stronger than the weak version does not &#8220;fall apart.&#8221; Definitely exists.</p>

<p>That is not at all my experience. The federal employees I&#8217;ve worked with or known usually fall into the &#8220;happy to have a job for life and try to do as little work as possible&#8221; category.</p>

<p>Okay. I work for the federal government and have worked fairly closely with about 30-50 people over the last few years and would say 1 falls into the category you suggest. She ended up resigning before she could be terminated.</p>

<p>the federal firing rate for people in service for more than 2 years is about 2 tens of one percent, and only drops from there. federal workers are virtually never fired.  </p>

<p>Leaving aside the first part, to which I think we&#8217;re just going to disagree on (it remains my position that we will get exactly as efficient a civil service as we choose to nurture), &#8216;obedient to their temporary political masters&#8217; is in fact part of the job duty, within the limits of the law and constitution. </p>
<p>I may be overly idealistic, but I and the people I work with do take those responsibilities seriously. There have been plenty of times I&#8217;ve received orders I disagreed with. I explained my disagreement and my predicted bad consequences of the proposed actions and then did what I was told. That is dead standard, at least with the folks I&#8217;ve worked with. </p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s fairly common for senior people (generally outside the agency) not to understand what&#8217;s happening on the ground, not to ask and then to demand &#8216;fix it,&#8217; with no other instruction. I&#8217;m sure the part where I say &#8216;no, seriously, there&#8217;s these fifteen laws which we have to comply with, we can&#8217;t just &#8216;fix it,&#8217; at least not without a specific legal exemption (talk to congress) or a big pile of money (talk to congress and my superiors) and time (and even then we may well be sued and this may take years to be resolved through the courts),&#8217; sounds identical to &#8216;no the deep state denies you this thing you want,&#8217; but it just isn&#8217;t. </p>
<p>On the question of firing. I don&#8217;t believe those numbers are accurate. The only source I can find in the minimal digging I can find <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.govexec.com/feature/firing-line/" rel="nofollow ugc">gives numbers twice as high</a>, but does say that the numbers are three times lower than private industry. However, those are limited to removal for performance or conduct. Based on that description, I don&#8217;t think it would include those terminated within their probationary period (most of the problem folks I&#8217;ve met can&#8217;t hide it for a year), nor would it capture the standard solution, which is the conversation which explains the performance issues, followed by resignation.</p>
<p>Now there are certainly problems in federal employee management and labor relations. The current system is fucking ridiculous. Back in law school my employment law professor literally said words to the effect of &#8216;skip the procedural section on any federal employee case, it will be too complicated to explain in this class and is only relevant for federal employees.&#8217; </p>
<p>But to fix it is going to require either absolute control by one party (in which case I would not really trust whatever fix they came up with) or both parties working together (which doesn&#8217;t seem likely to happen anytime in the career I&#8217;ve literally just started) so we&#8217;re pretty stuck at this point. I agree the system is bad, but you can actually make it work, I&#8217;ve seen it done. Mostly from a distance, as I am not the labor counselor (thank god).</p>

<p>They do.  But that doesn&#8217;t mean that democratic civil servants are going to leap to obey the wishes of republican appointees with all their enthusiasm.  And it&#8217;s silly to pretend that they will.   Hell, I work in the private sector, and when my boss tells me to do something stupid, I have all manner of ways of ignoring it or working around it.  As do the people that work for me, as she does vis-a-vis her boss.   All bureaucracies work this way, and it works more that way the less accountable the employees are.  </p>

<p>Right, but it means that both the denominator and the numerator of your percentage calculation are wrong.</p>

<p>No, I think it has a negative impact, which, at least in my experience is counterbalanced by other things. </p>
<p>The one which I think tends to get overlooked in everyone&#8217;s rush to demonstrate how &#8216;knowledgeable&#8217; and cynical they are is the sense of duty that comes with solemnly swearing or affirming the oath of office. But there are others. For instance the fact that I can&#8217;t be fired for saying &#8216;I think this is foolish and will have bad consequences,&#8217; to my boss has positive impacts on the workforce.</p>

<p>This is your belief, supported by a single anecdote. Mine, based on my experience is that this belief is incorrect (not the termination rates, that we can check, but is explicable in any number of ways). I think we&#8217;re going to have to agree to disagree.</p>

<p>When we&#8217;re asked to do something we think is a bad idea there are a number of options available.  You can argue the case, you can put the task at the bottom of your priorities, you can insist that it can&#8217;t be done without additional resources, you can implement it in the laziest way possible, you can dress up other efforts to look like compliance, you can delay by bringing in stakeholders to argue about how it should be done.  And if you do all of those in sequence, you can probably wait out your senate confirmed boss who&#8217;s going to be in his job for an average of 2 years.   </p>
<p>This is behavior that can be observed every day in every organization.  I doubt there&#8217;s a person over the age of 30 on this forum who hasn&#8217;t done most of the things on that list.  If you tell me that you leap to enthusiastically do things your boss tells you to do that you think are terrible, I&#8217;ll call you a liar.  the last time that happened was <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_no_one_rid_me_of_this_turbulent_priest%3F" rel="nofollow ugc">1170.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>This is your belief, supported by a single anecdote. Mine, based on my experience is that this belief is incorrect (not the termination rates, that we can check, but is explicable in any number of ways). I think we’re going to have to agree to disagree.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, it&#8217;s based on a lifetime of studying organization theory in general, of the performance of government bureaucracies in particular, living and working in a world full of people who have different ideas than their bosses about what&#8217;s important to their job.  And it&#8217;s backed up by vast amounts of evidence.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to disengage at this point because I have no desire to engage in this rather insulting and condescending exercise in goalpost moving any further, but as a last shot, because I can&#8217;t resist:</p>
<p>1) I am in fact over 30.<br />
2) Enthusiasm is not required, professionalism is.<br />
3) Your appeal to &#8216;I know because I&#8217;ve studied it&#8217; and &#8216;I know because I&#8217;m older&#8217; and &#8216;I know because human nature&#8217; is noted and rejected based on my own experiences.</p>

<p>Maybe. It&#8217;s probably very hard to tell from the outside. But for those tasks where I&#8217;ve been on the inside, the issue isn&#8217;t that people aren&#8217;t willing, but that what&#8217;s being requested is going to take time and money. </p>
<p>For all the talk of things being blocked, there aren&#8217;t really a lot of examples given. The obvious counter-example would be the Border Wall and Keystone Pipeline for this administration and DAPL for the last (though litigation has interfered with all three).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I feel like the discussion has retreated to a motte so general as to not be particularly meaningful. The tendency of workers to drag their feet when their boss tells them to do something stupid fits every company I&#8217;ve ever worked at, not just the government. If anything, I&#8217;d expect it to be less true in government, since government is the ultimate bureaucracy, and bureaucracy means following the rules even when they&#8217;re stupid with comparatively less room for human judgement.</p>
<p>I also think there&#8217;s a bit of a double standard in the arguments. When government employees are enthusiastic and engaged, they take initiative, which is evil because it means they&#8217;re actually trying to help rather than blindly following $Dear Leader&#8217;s orders.<br />
When government employees are disengaged and just following orders without care for the consequences, that&#8217;s also evil because it means they&#8217;re not implementing $Dear Leader&#8217;s vision as efficiently as they could be if they really tried. It seems like the only way the government can &#8220;win&#8221; by your standards is if it is a literal hivemind with $Dear Leader at the helm.</p>
<p>If all the &#8220;deep state&#8221; boils down to is that the government is not a hivemind maximally devoted to carrying out the leadership&#8217;s every whim, that&#8217;s not a very interesting argument.</p>

<p>the claim under discussion is that civil service workers have more considerably more scope for this behavior than private sector workers. And that is unquestionably true.  </p>
<blockquote><p>It seems like the only way the government can “win” by your standards is if it is a literal hivemind with $Dear Leader at the helm</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not about winning, it&#8217;s about accurately describing reality.  Civil servants are harder to fire or reward, bosses (at the appointed level) that have far shorter tenure and usually far less knowledge than they do, they have access to far more procedural tools that can be used as excuses, and an institutional environment with more checks.<br />
They are more free to take more initiative, or foot drag, in support of their bosses will, or opposed to it.  And to expect them not to take more advantage of this for their own purposes (however defined) they would have to not be human.</p>
<p>These shouldn&#8217;t be controversial statements.</p>

<p>they can go either way in the sense of &#8220;doing more&#8221; or &#8220;doing less.&#8221;  they can&#8217;t go both ways in &#8220;obedience to their political masters&#8221;.  People who have less incentive to do something will do less of it, and civil servants have far less incentive to do what their bosses want than private sector workers.  </p>
<blockquote><p>It seems to me like the motte has now devolved into “principle-agent problems exist”.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, it&#8217;s &#8220;principle agent problems exist, and they are demonstrably worse with civil servants than in the private sector.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>I suppose the solution to that is to outsource more government functions to the private sector. Fortunately, a number of large tech companies seem to have stumbled into a quasi-governmental role, so we’re already making good progress on that front.</p></blockquote>
<p>In practice, results here are mixed.  It can work moderately well when there is a large existing market for the good/service in question.  That makes it possible/easy for the government to switch providers.  For things that are largely government provided (e.g. military procurement) you tend to substitute one set of minimally accountable workers for another, while keeping most of the structural problems (the inflexibility of law &amp; budget, congress, short tenure of senior officials) in place.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If you have seen &#8220;Yes Minister,&#8221; which is an old British television show, it&#8217;s in part about the deep state, although it doesn&#8217;t use the term. The central figures are a government minister and the permanent secretary of his department, a career civil servant. In the typical episode, the minister gets excited about some problem and wants to take action against it. The secretary agrees and then maneuvers the minister into doing more or less the opposite of what he proposed, supporting the corruption the minister wanted to deal with or something along those lines. The secretary is obviously smarter and less naive than the minister, probably also less public spirited, committed more to the welfare of the bureaucracy he is part of than to the public good.</p>

<p>If anyone wants to understand how and why civil servants can and do wield considerable powers that theoretically belong exclusively to elected officials needs to watch that program. (It is also one of the funniest shows ever written, but it takes a couple episodes for you to get into it.) </p>
<p>It is one of two shows that everyone emerging from college should be forced to watch to learn that how much the actual workings of the world deviate from the theoretical workings of the world.</p>
<p>The other is The Wire.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I am indeed familiar with <i>Yes, Minister</i> (and <i>Yes, Prime Minister</i>) &#8212; I just didn&#8217;t realize that one of the meanings of &#8220;Deep State&#8221; was Sir Humphrey et al.  Reading through all of the responses to my question &#8212; thanks folks! &#8212; it is apparently one of those terms that has multiple meanings depending on context and speaker/listener.  </p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>A side note &#8211; Deep State is used loosely and doesn&#8217;t always mean career civil service. Rod Rosenstein is sometimes considered a Deep State figure, even though he was appointed to the office of Deputy AG by Trump himself. Likewise other presidential appointees who clashed with Trump after their appointment.</p>
<p>In a broad sense, it can mean all the people who&#8217;ve worked in DC long enough to think like everyone else in DC does, whether they work for the government, political campaigns, think tanks, contractors, lobbyists, the media, or bounce around among all of the above as swamp creatures are wont to do. And these people are the only ones who know enough about how the system works to function well in it, so they&#8217;re the ones the party calls on whenever they need to fill a position like, say, Deputy Attorney General. This obviously serves to frustrate any effort at real change or reform.</p>
<p>Of course, it doesn&#8217;t help that Trump has a, shall we say, unique management style and isn&#8217;t the easiest person to get along with. Just ask Rex Tillerson. Is he part of the Deep State, considering he never even worked in politics before Trump hired him? Who knows.</p>

<p>Tsai Ing-Wen makes preparations to welcome HKers to Taiwan. One of the most striking examples I&#8217;ve seen recently of a time where the right thing to do and the politically self-interested thing to do (hey, you think HK refugees might be disproportionately inclined to support the more anti-China party in Taiwan?) coincide.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It also occurs to me, re the Vox article, that this presents a conundrum for Trump that it would not have for &#8220;establishment&#8221; Republican presidents, namely that he would have to overcome his aversion to immigrants in order to act constructively on his antipathy to China. The parallel others have pointed out is the Cuban emigres fleeing Castro, and at the time they were emigrating the Republicans were much more pro-immigrant than today so there was no tension between that and their anti-Communism, and they got a new loyal Republican constituency out of it. There&#8217;s every reason to believe that HK refugees would be similarly loyal Republicans if the Republican Party were still that pro-immigrant, but as it is, they&#8217;re unlikely to be.</p>

<p>But Trump doesn&#8217;t have an aversion to immigrants. He has great antipathy for illegal immigrants, and some for those from shithole countries, but he likes the good ones. He married a super hot one, and says things like he wants immigration in <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2019/02/06/trump-boasts-rising-wages-welcomes-immigration-largest-numbers/" rel="nofollow ugc">&#8220;the largest numbers ever.&#8221;</a> I don&#8217;t see evidence he&#8217;s anti-good-immigration, so it all comes down to whether or not Hong Kong(&#8230;ers? ians? What&#8217;s the correct term for people from Hong Kong?) count as good immigrants. I think it would be pretty easy to make the case people from Hong Kong with skills and the money to flee Hong Kong would be a net positive. Plus he gets to stick it to the communist Chinese and prove he&#8217;s Super Not Racist. I could definitely see him doing this. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what to think personally. I&#8217;m more anti-immigration than Trump is, because I care about both economics and culture and I think he&#8217;s only interested in the economics. But I kind of think &#8220;people fleeing communists&#8221; are probably pretty good on the culture metric, like Cubans. I would give a plan to welcome HK immigrants a modest approval.</p>

<p>I assume this is tongue in cheek, but I figured I should point out for the benefit of anyone else lurking that the Trump administration has repeatedly pushed policies to limit legal immigration as well as illegal immigration.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Uh, no it was not tongue in cheek. And I think you agreed with me. Trump wants to eliminate illegal immigration, and limit legal immigration to &#8220;good&#8221; immigration, which means taking steps to eliminate &#8220;bad&#8221; immigration, like impoverished refugees, the diversity lottery, and family reunification. So he has pushed to limit legal immigration he doesn&#8217;t think helps us economically, and has stated he wants to increase the sorts of immigration he thinks would help the economy. Hong Kong citizens would probably fall in that second bucket.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>I don’t see evidence he’s anti-good-immigration</p></blockquote>
<p>This is circular.  &#8220;Good immigration&#8221; is not defined beyond &#8220;The sort of people Donald Trump likes,&#8221; so obviously Donald Trump will never be anti-good-immigration.  The argument is that Trump&#8217;s idea of &#8220;good immigrants&#8221; is so narrowly constrained compared to the pool of potential immigrants that it&#8217;s anti-immigration for all practical purposes.</p>
<p>As you say, Trump married an immigrant, but being pro-immigration for hot people willing to marry you does not count as being pro-immigration.</p>
<p>(It&#8217;s possible that &#8220;pro-immigration that hurts China&#8221; will turn out to be one of the narrow categories of immigration that Trump is pro-, but that only underlines how mercurial his positions are.)</p>

<p>Yes, it&#8217;s defined as &#8220;the sorts of people Donald Trump thinks will make the US better on net rather than worse.&#8221; </p>
<p>So, better would be educated wealthy people; <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbaGry1F_VU" rel="nofollow ugc">fit women</a>.</p>
<p>Worse would be impoverished refugees, random diversity quotas, family reunification (i.e., frequently old people).  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure we can clearly articulate a differentiation between people Trump thinks would make things better and who he thinks would make things worse. Again, I&#8217;m more skeptical of all of this than I think Trump is, but I don&#8217;t think his ideas of &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;bad&#8221; when it comes to immigration are inscrutable.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Vox is onboard with a very specific form of refugee flow where Hong Kongers all move to dying Rust Belt cities and are legally expected to stay there for 5 years (and socially expected to stay there afterwards).</p>
<p>Also, wtf?</p>
<blockquote><p>If it went well, it could be a model for a broader philosophical rethink of how America approaches competition with China — one that emphasizes deliberately increasing the US population to try to neutralize the massive advantage in scale that China currently enjoys</p></blockquote>
<p>America has enough people and enough wealth to manage competition with China. There are also a lot of people around China that are not fond of the Chinese. Managing strategic relationships is more important than desperately trying to increase the population, unless China gets REALLY wealthy, and then we get to have discussions about letting grandma die so we can buy more submarines and buy off some African warlords in the Great Kenya Civil War of 2060.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>In an attempt to <strike>get recognized by Scott for comment of the week</strike>  better understand CPI and how it is measured and the near term implications here is another post.  Please note this is specifically about CPI as a measure alone and not about higher (or lower) arguments about the money supply or what the real inflation rate is etc. </p>
<p>Recent recessions have been &#8216;deflationary&#8217; or at least that is the common conception of them.  More careful observers use the term &#8216;dis-inflationary&#8217; to denote lower than expected inflation as compared to outright deflation.  One point rarely made is that the 2007-2009 recession was slightly inflationary and not deflationary by many metrics.  Using CPI we can see that the lowest reading during the official recession (Dec 2008) was higher at 211.398 than the highest pre recession reading (Nov 2007, 210.834) and the final reading (214.790) was about 1% higher than the pre recession reading.  </p>
<p>Now there was a deflationary period, specifically the 3 months from September to December 2008 where the CPI index dropped from 218.877 to 211.398, for about a 14% annualized rate, but that was partially offset by the rise from May-July of 2008 which had CPI running at a ~9.5% annualized rate.  The first 4 months and the final 6 months had annualized inflation rates of ~3.5%.  </p>
<p>The 2001 recession was also not clearly deflationary, the official recession ran from March to November of 2001 and from March to September annualized inflation ran at ~2.3% an it was only the two months after September that we got ~2% annualized deflation in the CPI*.  </p>
<p>This makes correlations hard to see.  There are significant events in September of 2001 and 2008 that correlate to the beginning of the deflationary period, but there are no strong correlations for the end.  One might guess that based on the narrative of rising unemployment causing people to reduce spending and drive down prices that there might be a correlation there between CPI and UE, but there isn&#8217;t.  New UE claims rose through the end of March 2008, hitting a peak ~15% higher than the highest Dec 2008 reading, and the total UE rate kept rising until November 2009, 11 months after deflation had ceased and inflation had returned.  The UE peak in 2001 does hit the CPI bottom, but UE flat-lines there and then even climbs in the recovery (the infamous &#8216;jobless recovery&#8217;).</p>
<p>What actually drove the decline in CPI from September &#8211; December 2008?  If you guess housing because there was a housing bust and home prices fell from 2006 to 2012 well you guessed wrong.  The annualized decline in the housing portion of CPI for the 3 months ending in December 2008 was -0.7%, and for the 12 months ending in December 2008 it was +2.4%, and even within the -0.7% reading it was lodging away from home declining each of the 3 months, while rent and OER were increasing.  In fact both rent of primary residence and OER rose pretty close to on trend for the duration of the recession and only became a drag right near the end.  </p>
<p> Amazingly while home prices declined by ~28%, and mortgage rates dropped from 6.7% to under 4% from 2006 to 2012 rents increased by almost 15% during this period and OER increased by over 10%.  The driving factors for deflation in terms of CPI during both the 2001 and 2008 recessions were energy and apparel, and specifically gasoline, which is similar to the recent decline in CPI which was heavily gasoline/apparel related.</p>
<p>to be continued&#8230;</p>
<p>*There was actually 3 months of price declines with a very small decline in December 2001 which comes after the official end of the recession.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think it&#8217;s important to remember that inflation is an increase in the overall price level, and changes in relative prices do not contribute to inflation. The fact that oil gets more or less expensive doesn&#8217;t cause inflation to increase or decrease. If money supply is balanced against demand so that there is no inflation, one good becoming more expensive will only result in other prices becoming relatively lower. </p>
<p>Think about a barter economy. Inflation is impossible in a barter economy because inflation is a monetary phenomenon. But of course different goods can still go up or down in price in a barter economy by quite a bit. But by necessity if something becomes much more valuable (think food in a famine) other things have to become relatively cheaper (you can trade less food to get more of anything else).</p>
<p>So I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s useful to look at things that went up or down in price and draw conclusions about what &#8220;caused&#8221; inflation or deflation- since inflation and deflation are always caused by the relative supply and demand for money. It may be interesting to see what changed in value but it&#8217;s not relevant to inflation measures.</p>

<p>You keep responding to my posts on CPI with this, it is irrelevant.  CPI is a measurement and this is a post about CPI and how it is measured.  </p>

<p>This is a completely meaningless statement, its a tautology based on the definition you are using.  Obviously if you assume there is no inflation then there can&#8217;t be inflation.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a tautology that inflation is dictated by the money supply and not by relative changes in prices. I think people very often lose sight of the fact that price increases do not result in inflation- more the other way around.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Is it?</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes it is.  </p>
<blockquote><p> You seemed to be making some arguments about what was contributing to inflation or deflation, that’s why I had the response that I had.</p></blockquote>
<p>Seeing as this is the 2nd line in the post</p>
<blockquote><p> Please note this is specifically about CPI as a measure alone and not about higher (or lower) arguments about the money supply or what the real inflation rate is etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>I can only assume that you have simply not actually read it.  </p>
<blockquote><p>CPI is a measure of inflation but it’s a mistake to believe that the CPI is causally affected by the price changes of its components. I think that’s a common mistake that people make.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, you are absolute incorrect here.  CPI is literally a defined metric and you can look up its components if you want to.  The BLS takes multiple individual price changes and combines them (with weights) to produce the outcome.  They do not start with a measure of inflation and then break it up into components as your statement implies.  </p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t think it’s a tautology that inflation is dictated by the money supply and not by relative changes in prices.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is what you actually said that I was responding to:</p>
<blockquote><p> If money supply is balanced against demand <b>so that there is no inflation</b>, one good becoming more expensive will only result in other prices becoming relatively lower.</p></blockquote>
<p>This statement is a tautological, you have started from the assumption that there is no inflation and then come to the conclusion that one price going up must mean another declines to offset it.  The bolded portion prevents any knowledge from being gleaned from the statement while making it definition-ally true.</p>
<p>Edited because I put the wrong quote in the 2nd quote box.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think the issue here is that saying &#8220;CPI decreased because gasoline and apparel prices decreased&#8221; is implicitly comparing to a world where those things did not drop in price, and all other prices changed in the same way.</p>
<p>But then it&#8217;s just as valid to say that &#8220;CPI decreased because housing only increased 2.4%&#8221;, implicitly comparing to a world where housing prices increased (2.4 + X)%, and all other prices  changed in the same way. Or to do so for any component or combination of components.</p>
<p>Picking the components that happen to have the biggest swing in the same direction as the overall CPI doesn&#8217;t have special explanatory power. Otherwise you most volatile components always end up being blamed for all CPI changes.</p>

<p>I understand that, but the point is CPI doesn&#8217;t actually work this way.  CPI does not reflect every price change across a region, if you follow the second post I put up on housing it shows how you can get a positive reading for a CPI component with decreasing costs.  OER (which is the largest sub-component of CPI) does not reflect the price paid for a house or the total costs of owning a house but instead reflects how much a homeowner could expect to rent the house out for at the prevailing market rate.  </p>
<p>The criticism only holds if there is some known price level that goods are sold for and then we dis-aggregate them to discover how they moved relative to one another but this is not the case.  What occurs is the opposite, many &#8216;measures&#8217; are taken and then aggregated together to give us the &#8216;price level&#8217;, and as the housing example shows this price level does not directly reflect the actual prices paid in a period (it does/should for some things) but instead uses an intentionally smoothed proxy that doesn&#8217;t behave the same way in recessions and expansions.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>So the obvious question that my above post presents is how can you have 6 years of declining home prices and declining interest rates (interest rates are a significant cost of home-ownership) and have rising housing costs as a component of CPI.  The first point I want to make before wading in here is that there isn&#8217;t an obvious correlation between the rental <a rel="nofollow"href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=r5n2" rel="nofollow ugc">vacancy rate</a> and the slope of rental increases.  This directly undercuts an argument that I have seen multiple times, that monetary tightening cut our production of housing below where it needed to be to meet supply and so rental prices continued to rise.  Neither does there seem to be a relationship with delinquency rates and <a rel="nofollow"href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=r5na" rel="nofollow ugc">rental vacancies</a>.</p>
<p>In theory this sounds crazy because declining cost of ownership should lead to declining rents.  How so?  Well the Case/Shiller home price index was around 184 in 2006 and declined to about 134 in 2012 while mortgage rates fell from 6.7% to 4.0%.  A 30 year, $184,000 mortgage at 6.7% has a monthly payment of almost $1,200 a month (no pmi/insurance/taxes) while a $134,000 mortgage at 4.0% has a payment of $640.  That leaves a lot of room for a person who was foreclosed on and forced out to come back and rent that exact same house for significantly less than they were paying as an owner.  This ought to cause significant downward pressure on rents, and combined with essentially flat vacancy rates from 2004 to 2010 you have a substantial conundrum.  </p>
<p>This is a stab at the answer, but without hard data.  In general I think this is an artifact of the way that rent is calculated for the CPI, which uses the prices of transactions and not actually prices paid.  What do I mean by this?  Well if you ordered a hamburger for $10 then the transaction would be recorded as a $10 hamburger, but if you ordered a hamburger for $10 and then skipped out on the bill the transaction would not be recorded at $0.  If the number of people skipping out on their checks increases the headline price of hamburgers is likely to rise and while the average price actually paid per hamburger could stay flat the average price recorded would go up.  Likewise if you sign a lease for a place at $1,200 a month and get evicted due to missed rent payments then the* price of rent in your area will not be decreased based on the average you actually paid.  This imposes a large cost onto landlords, missed payments are significant for real estate and puts upward pressure on prices.  Why?  Simply put landlords who can&#8217;t cover their expenses are at risk of bankruptcy, if you own 5 units and one stops paying (or is vacant) and drops your cash flow below your obligations then one possible way out is to raise the price of the other 4 units.  </p>
<p>This speculation fits with some of the data, rents stopped increasing at the end of the 2008 recession as job losses slowed and delinquencies stop accelerating**. </p>
<p>*I believe not I can prove for sure</p>
<p>**Does not line up perfectly though.</p>

<p>What happens to the houses that people moved out of and switched to renting?  Why did rental vacancy rates hit their peak just after the recession and not fall with all these people moving from owing to renting?  </p>
<blockquote><p> Usually it’s not possible to increase your rents just because you want to, because one of your units is vacant.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is correct, usually it is not possible, but recessions are unusual times and the market clearing mechanisms function differently.</p>
<blockquote><p>How does it undercut that argument</p></blockquote>
<p>If there is a &#8216;shortage&#8217; of housing why would there also be a near record high in rental vacancies, as well as a record high for <a rel="nofollow"href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EVACANTUSQ176N" rel="nofollow ugc">empty housing</a>?  </p>
<blockquote><p>what does it mean that there is not an obvious correlation?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It means that the rental vacancy rate going up/down/sideways doesn&#8217;t mean that you see a consistent move in the rent price.  Higher vacancies don&#8217;t always mean lower rents.</p></blockquote>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>This makes correlations hard to see. There are significant events in September of 2001 and 2008 that correlate to the beginning of the deflationary period, but there are no strong correlations for the end. </p></blockquote>
<p>It would not be a bad idea to approach things like this, not by amateur speculation, but by actual study of the existing work on the subject.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re much more likely to find yourself wandering down a path of either re-treading already long trodden ground or developing weird, idiosyncratic, and ultimately incorrect beliefs than you are to stumble on new truths.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You have made the assumption that I am unfamiliar with any of the academic literature, in my opinion it is basically worthless*, for every paper you read you have to pick apart both their stated and implicit assumptions going in, and then wait 20-30 years to see if future events validate or invalidate their conclusions.  The Phillips curve is the classic example here where 15 years after the initial paper the correlation between inflation and employment completely broke down, invalidating a large body of work based on the (seen as accurately measured) observations.  </p>
<p>Recessions are too rare and different from each other for regression analysis to be effective, any real correlation is going to have to be eye-poppingly obvious or it is suspect.  </p>
<p>*worthless here means nearly impossible to tell if correct or incorrect or informative/not informative.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Via Robin Hanson&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow"href="https://twitter.com/robinhanson/status/1265996176597430276" rel="nofollow ugc">tweet</a>, a NY Times <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/28/opinion/harry-potter-rowling-corbyn-muggle.html" rel="nofollow ugc">opinion piece</a> about Harry Potter as an allegory for modern liberalism as an ideology centered around the authority of the elite academia.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thus the Potterverse, as Toad writes, is about “the legitimacy of authority that comes from schools” — Ivy League schools, elite schools, U.S. News &amp; World Report top 100 schools. And because “contemporary liberalism is the ideology of imperial academia, funneled through media and nonprofits and governmental agencies but responsible ultimately only to itself,” a story about a wizarding academy is the perfect fantasy story for the liberal meritocracy to tell about itself.</p></blockquote>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m predicting a complete and total nothingburger.</p>
<p>Specifically, it&#8217;ll say something like &#8220;the DOJ is directed to begin an investigation as to whether or not big social media companies are violating Americans civil rights by engaging in political censorship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most likely, the DOJ will drag its feet and not really get into the meat of any such investigation until after November, in which case President Biden will quietly shutter it.  In the unlikely event they move more quickly and/or Trump is re-elected, they&#8217;ll have a cursory investigation that concludes &#8220;no, they aren&#8217;t, everything they&#8217;re doing is fine&#8221; and that&#8217;ll be that.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>They don&#8217;t even need to drag their feet: is anything stopping them from <i>starting</i> by conducting an investigation, reporting that they found nothing wrong with the status quo, and changing nothing?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>[SPOILER]</p>
<p>A draft of the executive order has been leaked/published: <a rel="nofollow"href="https://kateklonick.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/DRAFT-EO-Preventing-Online-Censorship.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">https://kateklonick.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/DRAFT-EO-Preventing-Online-Censorship.pdf</a></p>
<p>From a quick skim, the goal is a slightly more restrictive interpretation of the types of editing a provider can perform without losing the protection from civil liability provided by Section 230.  The text of the current law provides protection if the provider acts in &#8220;good faith&#8221; to restrict access to content it considers to be &#8220;obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable&#8221;.  The order seems to say that &#8220;otherwise objectionable&#8221; should be defined as (something like) &#8216;against the provider&#8217;s terms of service&#8217;, such that any editing of posts that do not explicitly violate the terms of service causes the provider to be a &#8220;publisher&#8221; without additional protection from civil liability.  </p>
<p>As a non-expert who hasn&#8217;t read this closely, this sounds superficially reasonable.  If I didn&#8217;t know in advance that this was Trump&#8217;s executive order, I don&#8217;t think I couldn&#8217;t reliably identify which political party would be in support of or against this clarification.  It would be nice to see some expert opinion on whether this is a good change, particularly if the experts were able to divorce their pro- or anti-Trump bias from the consideration of the change.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That sounds way too reasonable to come directly from Trump. I wonder if saner minds in his administration jumped the gun and leaked the draft of a &#8220;nice&#8221; executive order to somehow prevent the issuing of a less-nice executive order.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Or it&#8217;s the expectation that no one will read it (Trump included?) </p>
<p>He gets to say he made an executive order against Twitter, the media runs with the narrative that Twitter and Trump are feuding, but the order is reasonable-enough on it&#8217;s face to be unchallenge-able in court. Eventually, you&#8217;ll see the national review or WSJ write some think piece about what a reasonable piece of executive legislation this was and how the media&#8217;s response to it was completely indicative of their lack of perspective. </p>
<p>God I&#8217;m sick of this.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That sounds like it won&#8217;t actually fix Trump&#8217;s problem with Twitter. All they have to do is amend their terms of service with something like &#8220;Don&#8217;t post misinformation&#8221;, and they can fact-check as many Trump Tweets as they like. It&#8217;s already common practice for TOS to reserve sole discretion for what constitutes [stuff they don&#8217;t like] and ban or downrank accordingly.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The leaked order repeatedly emphasizes that 230 should not apply to moderation that is &#8220;deceptive, pretextual, or inconsistent with a provider&#8217;s terms of service&#8221;. Write up something anodyne about reserving the right to moderate content that Twitter deems against its values and they can be as partisan as they like without it being anything the executive order targets.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Even with the proposed re-write, it doesn&#8217;t look like there is any requirement to be even-handed.</p>
<p>Being &#8220;deceptive&#8221; was already within review of the FTC. It&#8217;s probably &#8220;deceptive&#8221; if they say they are reviewing an appeal and don&#8217;t do anything with it for a year so if that stops, great. I won&#8217;t necessarily mind them having to stop lying about what they&#8217;re doing, but it&#8217;s hardly any huge dunk.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It seems useful as an opinion piece or rebuttal, but &#8220;fact check&#8221; carries the connotation that the press is impartially investigating a claim, and a negative verdict used as proof of a lie.

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Not a lawyer either, but the fact that section 230 is a protection from liability, rather than a criminal law, might make the difference.</p>
<p>Or maybe no one has tried to get section 230 protection stripped from a provider on that basis, so the courts have never had to arbitrate this topic.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My understanding is that the doctrine doesn&#8217;t apply just to criminal law, but to any statute.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re probably right that it has never been tested in court. Maybe it&#8217;s about time.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Wikipedia says:</p>
<blockquote><p>The &#8220;void for vagueness&#8221; doctrine applies only to criminal or penal laws (or quasi-criminal laws, for example laws that carry civil penalties), and laws that potentially limit constitutional rights.</p></blockquote>

<p>If Voat tried to hide behind Section 230 but President Biden ordered his DOJ to prosecute them because Voat wanted to use the &#8220;otherwise objectionable&#8221; and Biden&#8217;s DOJ said it didn&#8217;t work, then Voat might have grounds to complain.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Wikipedia (IANAL either) seems pretty clear that vagueness doctrine only applies to &#8220;criminal or penal laws&#8221; which this isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>But regardless of that, I don&#8217;t think it is vague. FCC vs Fox says that the law &#8220;you can&#8217;t publish obscene stuff&#8221; is vague, but in this case the law would be &#8220;you can&#8217;t publish stuff you consider to be obscene&#8221;. It seems pretty clear what that means.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>At a slight tangent &#8230;</p>
<p>Some time back, Facebook blocked all links to my web site, by me or anyone else. If you tried to link to it, you got a message saying that the page violated Facebook&#8217;s community standards. I followed the links for telling them that they were mistaken repeatedly, but never got any response, and eventually they stopped blocking it.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that although they had a right to block the links, claiming that the page violated their community standards when they had little reason to believe it did and were ignoring my response was arguably defamation, and that pointing that out might at least get them to change the claim from &#8220;violates our community standards&#8221; to &#8220;may violate our community standards,&#8221; which would more accurately describe the actual situation.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Something I&#8217;d like to see eliminated is the &#8220;no evidence&#8221; fact check.  You know the kind I mean&#8230; the one where someone (nearly always a Republican) makes a claim that X will lead to Y, and our friendly fact checkers chime in to insist that there is &#8220;no evidence&#8221; such a sequence of events will occur.  Of course, &#8220;no evidence X will happen&#8221; is not necessarily evidence that X <i>won&#8217;t</i> happen.</p>
<p>Often this is technically true, but I find it incredibly deceptive.  Based on the recent Coronalinks topic, I think one could reasonably suggest there is &#8220;no evidence&#8221; that lockdowns decrease the transmission of COVID-19.  And yet, no factchecker has dared to slap that alongside anyone&#8217;s claim that they do.  Or, for a less immediately CW example, back when the outrage of the day was Trump wanting to withdraw from Syria, I was inundated with claims from mainstream sources that this would certainly lead to a &#8220;brutal massacre of our allies, the Kurds.&#8221;  Of course, this was complete speculation.  It may be reasonable speculation.  There may be a solid argument for it.  But there was never any <i>evidence</i> of it.  And yet, the &#8220;no evidence&#8221; fact-check was never deployed.</p>
<p>These types of fact-checks are deployed only in specific cases and only against specific arguments/people.  I&#8217;d like to see them gone.  I don&#8217;t know how you&#8217;d phrase an EO to get rid of them specifically, I just find them incredibly inconsistent/annoying.</p>

<p>Not to be a spoilsport, but you might want to update your reference.  The Space Surveillance Network identifies and tracks orbital objects down to 10 cm in size, which makes it increasingly hard to hide a teapot.  I dare say mine is larger than that.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I do sometimes get concerned about the quasi-governmental role that large companies have stumbled into (and worried about it for many years before Trump was even a thing, so it&#8217;s not a partisan concern). But it&#8217;s hard to know what to do about it, or even if there is anything we should do about it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s all beside the point, since Trump isn&#8217;t going to do anything meaningfully to Twitter. It&#8217;s just part of a long history of &#8220;keyfabe&#8221; where he pretends to fight the media to win points with his base and the media pretends to fight him to win points with their base.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The extradition proceedings against Meng Wanzhou, the CFO of Huawei, ticked forward yesterday, when a B.C. Supreme Court judge ruled that the actions Ms. Meng is accused of constitute a crime in both Canada and the United States, and she therefore qualifies for extradition. There will be a further ruling later this summer on a defense motion that Ms. Meng&#8217;s rights were violated during her arrest. And presumably the matter will be appealed, so this could be in the courts for years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Chinese have arrested two Canadians, and are threatening various economic consequences for all of this.</p>
<p>Canada-China relations are certainly suffering. Here&#8217;s an excerpt from yesterday&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/article-canadas-china-problem-is-a-lot-bigger-than-the-meng-wanzhou-case/" rel="nofollow ugc">editorial</a> in the Globe &amp; Mail, one of Canada&#8217;s national newspapers:</p>
<blockquote><p>But when it comes to the big picture, of Canada’s relationship with China and Canada’s challenge of dealing with the nature of the regime that runs China, nothing has changed.</p>
<p>The problem of how to manage a relationship with an aggressive superpower remains. That would be so even if Ms. Meng had never been arrested in pursuit of a U.S. extradition request. It will be so whether she is eventually sent to the United States to face trial.</p>
<p>The damage is already done. Or rather, Canada’s veil of China illusions has already been ripped off. Illusions, like disposable medical masks, cannot be reapplied.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Last year, we suggested four principles Canada must keep in mind when dealing with China. The issue is of course not China itself, but the regime that runs the country. However, given that the regime isn’t changing, we believe these principles still hold and will for some time.</p>
<p>&#8211; China is more of a threat than opportunity.<br />
&#8211; China is not our enemy, but neither is it our friend.<br />
&#8211; To counterbalance China, we need allies.<br />
&#8211; We must continue to trade with China while avoiding becoming dependent on it.</p>
<p>Regardless of how the Meng case is resolved, our China challenge will remain. Her situation, and that of the Michaels, are symptoms with a deeper cause. Canada’s long-term problem is bigger than one extradition request for one telecom executive.</p></blockquote>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Principle #5: Canada is America&#8217;s Bitch, so if POTUS decides China needs to be taken down a notch by having one of its VIPs arrested but doesn&#8217;t want American(*) citizens to be subject to retaliation, Canada&#8217;s just going to have to suck it up, make the arrest on Canadian soil, and accept that some Canadians aren&#8217;t coming home from China in retaliation.</p>
<p>It would be quite expensive for Canada to graduate to Nobody&#8217;s Bitch standards, probably cutting in to the nice social welfare state that Canadians are so fond of.  Somewhat cheaper would be Canada deciding to shift from being America&#8217;s Bitch to China&#8217;s Bitch.  And, decidedly unpleasant for the United States to have a Chinese protectorate on its northern border, which is something the US <i>should</i> keep in mind as it plays the &#8220;We&#8217;re America, Bitch&#8221; card with reckless abandon.  </p>
<p>But for now, I think we&#8217;ve got a stable equilibrium, and Canada will suck it up and sacrifice a few of its citizens to Chinese jails to keep it so.  If the United States is smart about it, they&#8217;ll <i>want</i> Meng sitting in a Canadian holding cell for as long as possible, rather than actually extradited to the United States.  I expect Canada will eventually be able to unload that hot potato on the US, at least.</p>
<p>* You know, <i>real</i> American</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The best result for Canada is probably having the whole matter stretch into a hypothetical Biden administration, and the Canadian courts then deciding not to extradite Meng. This would go some distance toward satisfying the Chinese, who probably only care about the final resolution of the matter. (The fact that we arrested one of their VIPs is damage already done, and which can&#8217;t be undone.) The Americans wouldn&#8217;t be happy to see Meng released, but they have independent courts just as we do, so I think they would understand. I&#8217;d be very surprised to see any sort of retaliation from the US in that scenario, particularly under a less belligerent Biden administration.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>John, are you implying that you think the Canadian court decision was caused by US pressure?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m enough of a formalist that if a Canadian court rules that there&#8217;s credible evidence that she committed a crime under both US and Canadian law and that the relevant treaty requires extradition, and assuming the ruling is correct, then extradition should be the outcome even if China announces they now have a policy of arresting Canadians.  </p>
<p>If it&#8217;s a stupid law, then the solution is for Canada to fix its stupid laws, not to enforce them for everyone but politically connected Chinese citizens.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the court ruling is legally wrong and the result of US pressure, then the whole system is corrupt and I agree with your analysis. 🙂</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>There is some reason to think the arrest of Meng is part of a campaign by the US government to gain economic advantage for its companies by aggressive use of its court system. <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3012497/heres-why-huawei-ceo-ren-zhengfei-reading-frenchmans-book" rel="nofollow ugc">Here&#8217;s an article</a> in the South China Morning Post, based on the book The American Trap by Frederic Pierucci. Pierrucci is one of several executives of foreign companies who have been arrested by the US DOJ over the years for various corruption charges. The claim is that these prosecutions are notably lopsided, pursued aggressively against foreign companies, but much less so against American companies. Is that true? Seems plausible, at least. I don&#8217;t think the Americans are beyond using some shenanigans to keep their computer/internet/telecom industry from going the way of their auto industry.</p>
<p>But on the Canadian side, as far as I understand from the Canadian press, we are simply scrupulously honoring a fully legal request under a longstanding treaty, while giving the target of that request the full benefit of the protections of our legal system.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Any undue influence is almost certainly being applied through executive rather than judicial channels.  Canadian judges aren&#8217;t going to change their rulings just because the US (or even Canadian) state department tells them to, and they&#8217;ll probably bend over backwards to avoid the appearance of that sort of impropriety if it came to that.</p>
<p>But Canadian courts cannot investigate the facts of the case any more than US courts could; for that they are dependent on whatever facts the RCMP brings to the table and almost certainly with a strong bias towards &#8220;our cops don&#8217;t lie&#8221;.  And the RCMP has always worked closely with the FBI in cross-border affairs.  If the US wants to sway a Canadian judge&#8217;s rulings, they&#8217;ll almost certainly do it by working with the RCMP to give that judge a carefully cherrypicked subset of the relevant facts.</p>

<p>More likely, in my view, is Canada getting caught in the middle as one of the theatres where US-China rivalry plays out. Hopefully it only goes as far as espionage and competition for buying up strategic infrastructure and resources. Both of which are already happening.</p>

<p>The graph at the bottom shows a strong relationship between the current number of excess deaths and how large the outbreak was at the time the lockdown started. This came up in a previous OT and suggests that when evaluating the efficacy of lockdowns, the timing of them is important and there&#8217;s more to it than &#8220;these countries locked down but still have terrible outbreaks&#8221;.</p>
<p>They do something a bit funny with Sweden (which didn&#8217;t lock down, and instead they pick &#8220;transit usage is 50% down&#8221; as their &#8220;day of lockdown&#8221;) but the relationship holds regardless.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Two interesting things there.<br />
1) The US only has about ~65,000 excess deaths, but ~100,000 COVID19 deaths. Does that just mean that the lockdowns have &#8220;saved&#8221; ~35,000 people from things like the flu, car accidents, etc?</p>
<p>2) That graph of deaths to lockdowns has some really crazy scaling going on. I&#8217;m having a hard time getting any information out of it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That is odd. I&#8217;m not familiar with the US numbers at all. The excess deaths thing has been studied a fair bit in the UK because the actual Covid testing numbers are so obviously undercounting the true numbers. </p>
<p>The graph has changed since I posted that link this morning, which is unhelpful. The new version is weird, the old version was a bit more comprehensible and showed a much tighter relationship. I don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing to the x axis now but it was total cases before, not axes per million and they hadn&#8217;t warped it all over the place. I don&#8217;t even think it&#8217;s a log scale?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad I said provisional when I first posted this because I&#8217;m much less confident in it now.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m not sure where specifically you&#8217;re getting the 65,000 number from, but the CDC is the most common source. They only currently have numbers up to May 9, so the thousand or so deaths a day since then aren&#8217;t up yet. They also note that their &#8220;excess deaths&#8221; calculation is done with provisional data and that recent weeks are likely to have additional deaths added (presumably lots of low-priority deaths that just haven&#8217;t been tabulated yet). Furthermore, the &#8220;excess deaths&#8221; calculation appears to measure the difference between observed deaths in a week and a threshold that is about 2,000 greater than the predicted deaths in that week. So our best guess should be that over an eight week period, the &#8220;excess deaths&#8221; number undercounts the actual excess deaths by about 16,000.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I was responding to the article in the top post. The second graph shows the US around ~65,000 excess deaths, updated May 27th. That does not match up with what the CDC link you shared is saying, so I&#8217;m going to guess that the Financial Times is looking at something different.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>In &#8220;There&#8217;s One Born Every Minute&#8221; news, this <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.businessinsider.com/400-dollar-anti-5g-usb-actually-7-dollars-added-sticker-2020-5?r=US&amp;IR=T" rel="nofollow ugc">latest</a> blossoming of the entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
<blockquote><p>A USB drive costing $416 that claims to emit a shield that blocks &#8220;electric fog&#8221; caused by 5G was found to be a $6 drive covered with a shiny sticker.</p>
<p>IT security firm Pen Test Partners purchased and analysed the 5GBioShield and found it was &#8220;virtually identical&#8221; to a popular USB drive available from wholesalers in China for around $6 (£5).</p>
<p>Business Insider found a number of three-pack USB drives which resemble the $416 product, including on the Alibaba-operated marketplace Aliexpress, on Etsy, and on Wish.</p>
<p>Those products also all come in the same three colors as those marketed by 5GBioShield: gold, rose gold, and silver.</p>
<p>In the report, published on Thursday, Pen Test Partners said the sole difference between the wholesale items and the 5GBioShield product was the addition of a sticker.</p>
<p>Ken Munro, owner of Pen Test Partners, wrote: &#8220;In our opinion the 5G Bioshield is nothing more than a £5 USB key with a sticker on it. Whether or not the sticker provides £300 pounds worth of quantum holographic catalyzer technology we&#8217;ll leave you to decide.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also told the BBC that the sticker &#8220;looks remarkably like one available in sheets from stationery suppliers for less than a penny.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>On the one hand, it&#8217;s nice to see that even in a time of global lockdown, China can still provide cheap goods for us thirsty consumers in the West.  On the other hand, it&#8217;s depressing that a combination of fearful ignorance and sprinkling techy-sounding buzzwords will enable scammers, fraudsters, and the Del Boys to pluck pigeons in abundance.</p>
<p>And in &#8220;I&#8217;m appalled but also secretly delighted &#8211; I&#8217;m feeling so conflicted&#8221; news, <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/us/trump-to-sign-executive-order-on-social-media-white-house-says-1.4264617" rel="nofollow ugc">this</a> just in.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s a bad precedent to set, but Twitter starting playing politics first and it was Obama who led the way with &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a phone and a pen&#8221; &#8211; as we conservatives kept saying when those delighted by his daring leadership were in transports of bliss, be careful what powers you abrogate because you won&#8217;t always be the ones in power, and those powers will remain when your opponents take over, and you can&#8217;t expect them not to be used against you.</p>
<p>You shouldn&#8217;t dare Donald Trump because he <i>will</i> take that dare.  I&#8217;m not saying this is a good thing, I&#8217;m saying this is how the guy operates, and frankly if Twitter are going to do the &#8220;I&#8217;m shocked, shocked!&#8221; bit, they haven&#8217;t a leg to stand on.  This is reminding me of a discussion we had ages ago in the middle of that thread about Borderers and <i>Albion&#8217;s Seed</i>, where one lot of us were saying &#8220;If you tell someone <i>Make me</i>, you are asking for a punch in the snoot and can&#8217;t be surprised when you get one&#8221; because when verbal provocation gets to a certain point, everyone understands that it&#8217;s going to evoke physical retaliation, and the other lot were horrified because that&#8217;s only verbal arguing, you aren&#8217;t supposed to take it to the point of physical retaliation, that&#8217;s barbaric!</p>
<p>In this case, Twitter said &#8220;Make me&#8221; and Trump is now punching them in the snoot.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My personal favorite are all the conservatives who, 99% of the time, are quite clear to loudly declare that they are <i>not</i> libertarians, and that government regulation of private business is just and proper in order to ensure fairness and prevent exploitation and keep in check the obvious and predictable evils of &#8220;unfettered capitalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the second Trump says something bad about big tech, all of a sudden they&#8217;re first amendment absolutists who are shocked and horrified that the government might presume to regulate a private business, which is clearly unconstitutional and would lead to all sorts of nightmare socialist scenarios.</p>
<p>I struggle to recognize a coherent philosophy that justifies, say, the minimum wage, but sees &#8220;no you cannot censor people based on their political views&#8221; as unacceptable totalitarianism.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>A better description might be &#8220;only the Left is allowed to regulate businesses&#8221; because they certainly aren&#8217;t willing to fight the culture war on their behalf, standing on principle against regulation supporting ideals supported by the Right, but unwilling to repeal the mandates imposed by the Left.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a reason why there are new terms for such politicians such as c*ckservatives.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p> it was Obama who led the way with “I’ve got a phone and a pen”  </p></blockquote>
<p>This seems like, to me, a false equivalency. Executive orders are a well-established part of the powers of the executive branch; using the power of the FTC and the FCC to intimidate the media into giving you an unchecked propaganda channel is not. This is a dangerous overreach of executive power, and one that, if not met by a swift pushback by conservatives, may well end up being used by Democratic administrations to silence conservative voices.</p>

<p>lol</p>
<p>Conservative voices are already being silenced by Twitter and Facebook and Google.  That&#8217;s the whole complaint.  A potential Democratic administration wouldn&#8217;t have to do anything at all to censor conservatives other than give a wink in the direction of Silicon Valley promising them that the feds won&#8217;t come after them for the behavior they&#8217;ve already been getting away with.</p>
<p>The modern conservative finds itself in a pretty awkward position.  On the one hand, they have strong philosophical objections to federal power.  On the other hand, the federal government is probably the only powerful institution in all of society that even pretends to give a single **** about red tribe people and their preferences <i>at all</i>.</p>
<p>If the current board of directors of Twitter/Facebook/whatever was replaced with a panel of such people appointed by Congress, there would almost certainly be more red tribe representation/sympathy on it, (even during times when Dems control all branches of government) than there is today.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I recognize that your personal media bubble might prevent you from perceiving this, but liberals also feel that they are being silenced by Twitter. In reality, I believe that Twitter is just incapable of (or uninterested in) fully enforcing its terms of service. It&#8217;s only the highest-profile violators, like Alex Jones (on the right) or the <a rel="nofollow"href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/twitter-bans-ed-brian-krassenstein-brothers-fake-accounts-1203225266/" rel="nofollow ugc">Krassenstein brothers</a> (on the left), that actually get punished. However, the conservative media seems to have enshrined their &#8220;unfair treatment&#8221; by tech giants as a shibboleth. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, Trump is using this as an excuse to try to harass private entities into giving him special treatment and immunity from punishment; in reality, he probably should&#8217;ve been perma-banned some time ago. I&#8217;m disappointed that you don&#8217;t seem to have a problem with this overreach of Federal power.</p>

<p> So? That doesn&#8217;t prove that these companies are engaged in unfair suppression of right-wing voices. If you feel that it does, it kind of sounds like, to me, that you feel that it&#8217;s impossible for anyone with left-wing political views to fairly treat someone with right-wing political views.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Sorry, having some weird browser issue.  What I meant to reply was that my original reply was specifically addressing the notion that granting political bodies control over social media moderation policies might somehow “backfire” on conservatives, leaving them <i>more</i> censored than they are right now.</p>
<p>And yes, establishing that 90% of Twitter/FB employees are very liberal, whereas, even during times of liberal ascendency, roughly 40% of Congress is always at least nominally conservative, would go a long way into confirming this.</p>
<p>My point is less trying to convince you that Twitter/FB are or aren’t horribly biased against conservatives right now.  My point is more that the notion that conservatives should fear an outcome where this somehow gets worse is absurd, given that the government will virtually never be more radically opposed to conservatism than the default silicon valley staffing pool is.</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s relatively rare for <i>anyone </i> to treat <i>anyone they disagree with</i> fairly, and tech employees are not magical saints that are above this kind of bias or above taking advantage of the power that has fallen into their laps. </p>
<p>I would, however, expect people with more experience (the C-suiters in the example) to be a little more cautious and strategic, in general, when compared to the passionate intensity of youthful zealots. It is <i>coincidentally </i> left-wing, rather than <i>inherently</i>. </p>
<p>See also: the points of history where the Moral Majority was American Protestant instead of Bay Area Progressive. Similar efforts, from the other side.</p>

<p>Bear in mind, it won&#8217;t be a representative sampling of congress-critters who are in charge of some hypothetical Department of Social Media Monitoring. It&#8217;ll be bureaucrats appointed by the executive branch. These people, unlike Twitter&#8217;s current staffing pool, will be more interested in pleasing their boss than making sure that Twitter continues to exist. If that means massive-scale banning of conservatives, it will happen, and there won&#8217;t be much Congress can do about it if they don&#8217;t take a stand now.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>The argument that “it can’t get worse than this” rings false when there’s so many prominent conservatives who remain quite unpunished from Twitter, even when they break the rules. </p></blockquote>
<p>Name a few.  Besides Trump, who everyone seemingly concedes is immune only because he is literally President.  I mean come on man, <i>Prager U</i> has been almost thoroughly demonetized and shadowbanned.  They are as milquetoast and mainstream as it gets.  And they get content blocked routinely.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’ll be bureaucrats appointed by the executive branch. </p></blockquote>
<p>Who want to keep their jobs even if the party of the President changes.  And who are generally older moderates and, by nature of being government employees, are obligated to <i>at least pretend</i> that free speech is still a cultural value worth upholding.  Which is more than we can say about the silicon valley professional class, many of whom believe that &#8220;hate speech doesn&#8217;t count as free speech&#8221; is already literally the law and will argue with you if you try and suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that it&#8217;s <i>impossible</i> that Twitter could be worse on conservatives.  I am saying that turning moderation responsibilities over to the government is <i>incredibly</i> unlikely to lead to a worse outcome (and quite reasonably likely to lead to a better one).  At least there&#8217;s a chance that Republicans will occasionally win elections.  The odds that a true socially conservative red-tribe republican would win a majority of seats on Twitter&#8217;s board of directors, or Twitter&#8217;s &#8220;trust and safety council&#8221; is approximately zero.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Name a few.</p></blockquote>
<p>Michelle Malkin. Karl Rove. Andy Ngo. Newt Gingrich. I could go on. Or are none of them conservative by your standards?</p>
<blockquote><p>Who want to keep their jobs even if the party of the President changes. And who are generally older moderates and, by nature of being government employees, are obligated to at least pretend that free speech is still a cultural value worth upholding. Which is more than we can say about the silicon valley professional class, many of whom believe that “hate speech doesn’t count as free speech” is already literally the law and will argue with you if you try and suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that it’s impossible that Twitter could be worse on conservatives. I am saying that turning moderation responsibilities over to the government is incredibly unlikely to lead to a worse outcome (and quite reasonably likely to lead to a better one). At least there’s a chance that Republicans will occasionally win elections. The odds that a true socially conservative red-tribe republican would win a majority of seats on Twitter’s board of directors, or Twitter’s “trust and safety council” is approximately zero.</p></blockquote>
<p>The argument that we can trust the state with the power to regulate free speech over the conscience of private individuals (and the power of the free market) seems like an odd one for a conservative to make, but maybe this just shows that I still don&#8217;t understand modern conservatives very well.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a conservative, though I get the feeling that the disconnect is in the &#8220;principle&#8221; vs. &#8220;culture war&#8221; dynamic. As a principle, they&#8217;d prefer businesses to completely self-regulate. But in culture war terms, they recognize that the government is already allowed to mandate significant left-wing HR and industry policies. So in that case they should insist on any action which disproportionately helps their side, even if it&#8217;s a net negative. Because conflict theory, culture war, etc.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t think Matt M is making an argument that this falls in line with conservative principles, I think hes steel manning why a group of people who are generally opposed to state coercion are suddenly okay with it. </p>
<p>This is kinda an example of &#8220;The ideology is not the movement&#8221; and the red tribe seems open to sacrificing its own sacred cows in the name of self preservation. In the age of Trump, it often takes the form of &#8220;Make them play by their own rules&#8221; or, &#8220;I prefer small government that doesn&#8217;t oppress anyone, but if we can&#8217;t have that I would rather be the oppressor than the oppressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>I too get the sense that twitter suppresses the right</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Matt M should feel free to correct me if he feels I&#8217;m misinterpreting him, but the position he&#8217;s arguing doesn&#8217;t sound like a steelman of something he disagrees with &#8211; it feels like that&#8217;s his actual position on the level of power the state should have in regulation of the media. </p>
<blockquote><p> In the age of Trump, it often takes the form of “Make them play by their own rules” or, “I prefer small government that doesn’t oppress anyone, but if we can’t have that I would rather be the oppressor than the oppressed.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In this case, the government isn&#8217;t oppressing anyone; Twitter is not the state. A private enterprise is applying its own rules as it sees fit, and Trump is trying to use the state to harass them into changing those rules in such a way that would benefit him and his followers (as he sees it). </p>
<p>Also, IMO, if you abandon your principles the instant they become inconvenient, you never actually had any.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>The argument that we can trust the state with the power to regulate free speech over the conscience of private individuals (and the power of the free market) seems like an odd one for a conservative to make, but maybe this just shows that I still don’t understand modern conservatives very well.</p></blockquote>
<p>The argument, as I interpret it, is that the question is to what degree social media companies should be free to determine their own policies, to what degree constrained by the government. If you believe, as I think Matt does, that the companies are considerably farther left than even a Democratic administration, then leaving them free will result in their being more anti-conservative than constraining them, even if the constraint is done by Democrats. So constraining them produces a benefit for conservatives, even if Biden wins the election.</p>
<p>That isn&#8217;t, of course, an argument on principle but on consequences.</p>
<p>The one weakness in the argument, suggested by the references to the C-suite, is that the behavior of the companies is to some degree constrained by market forces. To take the most obvious example, even if they would like to ban Trump from Twitter, and even if they believe that there is nothing Trump could do to stop them, banning him would result in a lot fewer tweets and so cost them money. </p>
<p>So it&#8217;s possible that a company whose employees were five points to the left would only act two points to the left, and could be pushed farther by a Democratic administration that was three. Also, if companies are free to do as they like and choose to block a lot of popular conservatives, that might lead to the rise of competitors that specialized in conservatives, parallel to what happened with news media, a change that could be blocked  by sufficiently powerful regulators.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>So here&#8217;s my belated fact-check. 🙂</p>
<p>For the category of &#8220;remain quite unpunished from Twitter, even when they break the rules.&#8221; @broblawsky nominated &#8220;Michelle Malkin. Karl Rove. Andy Ngo. Newt Gingrich.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nothing exhausting, but I spent a few minutes googling away to see if Twitter had punished any of them.</p>
<p>I found nothing for Malkin except a video she appeared in (not her tweet) which Trump retweeted and then Twitter removed, this one hour or so <a rel="nofollow"href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/karl-rove-suspended-on-twitter" rel="nofollow ugc">vanishing</a> for Karl Rove, Andy Ngo <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/nov/25/andy-ngo-suspended-twitter/" rel="nofollow ugc">suspended</a>, and so much media noise about Newt being suspended by Fox News that there was no hope to tell anything related to twitter using the search terms I mentally pre-committed myself to (Twitter suspends account &#8220;name&#8221;).</p>
<p>So probably not &#8220;quite unpunished&#8221; in all cases.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t dispute that those people are conservatives.  I dispute that they somehow regularly and flagrantly &#8220;violate the rules.&#8221;  I&#8217;d be interested in seeing examples of what rules they supposedly violate.</p>
<p>Andy Gno is a particularly interesting example to bring up.  About half the Tweets of his I actually see* are him posting screenshots of literal, not at all subtle, death threats he receives from antifa accounts, which always go unpunished.</p>
<p>*I don&#8217;t see most of his tweets because <strike>he is shadowbanned</strike> Twitter&#8217;s proprietary algorithm, that is certainly  completely apolitical, has decided I probably wouldn&#8217;t be interested in what he has to say (even though I reply and like and interact with his tweets frequently)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d call twitter &#8220;the media&#8221;, but the previous administration was caught using the IRS and FBI to intimidate their political opponents, which seems much worse.

<p>First, you were responding to a critique made about the Obama administration&#8217;s behavior, so talking about its actions is hardly &#8220;ancient scandals&#8221;, especially when one of them is currently in the news.  </p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>I’m not sure I’d call twitter “the media”, but the previous administration was caught using the IRS and FBI to intimidate their political opponents, which seems much worse.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s not a fair or accurate characterisation of the IRS targetting controversy. </p>
<p>While it&#8217;s probably true that some IRS agents did subject some right-wing organisations trying to claim tax-exempt status to a disproportionately high standard of scrutiny, for whatever reason*, Obama didn&#8217;t even know about it, let alone instigate it. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s not remotely comparable to Trump deliberately abusing his own power.</p>
<p>* It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if groups with anti-tax political views tried to play fast and loose with how much tax they owed more often than those with pro-tax political views, but to be fair it also wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if IRS agents abused their powers to promote their own political agenda, and even if they do I think the IRS probably shouldn&#8217;t act on that knowledge.</p>

<p>That he didn&#8217;t have to instigate it is more problematic than if he did.  If some of MAGA hat wearing officials in the bureau of whatever decided to start harassing anti-trump organizations, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d be calmed by the fact that trump didn&#8217;t actually order them to do it, especially if no one involved was actually punished in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>If Trump were to appoint people who subsequently abused their positions without his knowledge, I would probably blame him for that.</p>
<p>If government officials were to abuse their positions at his incitement but without his knowledge, I would probably blame him for that. </p>
<p>If people appointed under a previous, Democratic president (the policy in question dated back to 2004), a long way down the ladder (micromanaging the Determinations unit of the Cincinnatti office of the IRS is not traditionally viewed as being the president&#8217;s responsibility) did so, in direct opposition to the values and principles he&#8217;d promoted, I would not. </p>
<blockquote><p>Would you also surprise you if people who believe in more entitlement spending were more likely to abuse the welfare system?</p></blockquote>
<p>No, but not for the reasons you think. </p>
<p>I think that the strongest correlate with &#8220;likely to abuse the welfare system&#8221; is &#8220;desperately needs to use the welfare system&#8221;, which will obviously in turn correlate with supporting it.</p>
<p>But if you were to control for need, my guess is that people who believe that the welfare system is a good thing are less likely to abuse it than people who think it&#8217;s a bad one and therefore don&#8217;t feel guilty about taking advantage of it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That&#8217;s kind of the thing. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with executive orders. Those are pretty much how the executive wields his authorized power. The problem is EOs that wield unauthorized power, like Obama&#8217;s DAPA. </p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have to wait to see Trump&#8217;s EO to determine whether or not the power he&#8217;s wielding is authorized or unauthorized, but to my knowledge, to date none of his EOs have been found to be illegitimate by the courts, so maybe this will be the first.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Muslim ban 1.0 was injunctified, lost several times in court, then the administration watered it down significantly with 2.0, and only then did Hawaii get involved. The injunction was partially over turned, but the order was still watered down somewhat. Then came 3.0, the supreme court case, and the ruling to uphold. But 1.0 was killed by the courts, and probably would have lost at the supreme court, imo.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>This seems like, to me, a false equivalency. Executive orders are a well-established part of the powers of the executive branch; </p></blockquote>
<p>Which are mostly used to direct executive-branch agencies to do something within their general sphere of influence but which they wouldn&#8217;t have done in the ordinary course of events.</p>
<blockquote><p>using the power of the FTC and the FCC to intimidate the media into giving you an unchecked propaganda channel is not.</p></blockquote>
<p>And the way executive-branch agencies normally work is by suggesting that life will become unpleasant for anyone who doesn&#8217;t go along with the new agenda, rather than actually implementing enforcement actions against everyone who does things the old way.  So, I&#8217;m only seeing a difference at the level of the specific target and goal.</p>
<p>If the defense is, &#8220;It is well-established that left-leaning Presidents use executive orders to direct federal agencies to intimidate people into supporting left-wing goals; doing that to <i>different</i> people to support <i>right-wing</i> goals is not&#8221;, then meh, not caring much that it&#8217;s your sacred ox being gored this time.</p>
<p>So this time the FCC writes a &#8220;dear colleague&#8221; letter to the CEOs of social media companies, instead of the Education Department to college and university administrators.  I&#8217;m not a big fan of either, but I don&#8217;t consider the one worse than the other.  And the one used up enough of my finite supply of outrage that I have less to spare for the victims of the other.  The bit where Obama had the sense to arrange that quietly behind the scenes while Trump is trumpeting his moves as usual, doesn&#8217;t really change anything.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I get that it can be annoying when people plug their blogs here, but as this Wednesday coincides with the 40th anniversary of the <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwangju_Uprising" rel="nofollow ugc">fall of Gwangju</a> to the armed forces of Korean dictator Chun Doo-hwan, I thought it might be apropos to mention that I&#8217;ve been writing a history of the Gwangju Democratic Uprising <a rel="nofollow"href="https://gwangjulikeit.home.blog/" rel="nofollow ugc">on my own blog.</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a surprisingly little known event in the West, considering it was a major massacre taking place on the territory of an important US ally. In a nutshell, in May, 1980, Chun, who was new in power and feeling a bit insecure, declared martial law over the whole Republic of Korea, which provoked a series of increasingly bloody clashes between students and paratroopers in the southern city of Gwangju. One thing led to another and the citizens of Gwangju seized weapons from police and national guard armories all around the region and drove the soldiers out of the city, making Gwangju the only self-governing city on the Korean peninsula for a few days. On May 27, after blockading the city and cutting off all news, the government forces launched a counteroffensive and crushed the uprising in a few hours. Between 200 (according to government sources) and 2,000 (according to various victim advocacy groups) people were killed in the fighting, which places the uprising on the same scale as Tiananmen, which is a much better known massacre. </p>
<p>Gwangju is my home city and memories of the massacre are everywhere, along with a large amount of civic pride in Gwangju&#8217;s resistance to the dictator. Many Gwangju citizens claim that it was their example that inspired Korea&#8217;s democratization movement, which succeeded 7 years later in ending the military dictatorship.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Well, as bad as Rhee and Park were, they rarely resorted to outright murder. Usually, the most prominent critics of the regime would be arrested, roughed up a bit, in the worst cases held for a few months or even exiled, but Park tried to quietly kill the standouts only on a handful of occasions &#8211; there were no gulags. The US wouldn&#8217;t allow such a naked dictatorship, so instead the ROK was a sham democracy with rigged elections, strict censorship, harassment of the opposition by the authorities, etc. </p>
<p>NK, on the other hand, was full-blown Stalinist dictatorship. Lots of Southerners got a taste of that during the few months the North occupied most of the country and wanted no part of it. That&#8217;s partially why the regimes were so often able to clamp down on criticism &#8211; they&#8217;d say any &#8216;instability&#8217; would lead to a northern invasion and so for the security of all they&#8217;d just have to declare martial law and &#8216;take charge&#8217; for a while. Park and Chun Doo-hwan did this a lot. </p>
<p>To say nothing of the much freer economy in the ROK vs. the DPRK&#8230;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That&#8217;s a fascinating story.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always wondered why the ROK didn&#8217;t transition to democracy in the 60&#8217;s or 70&#8217;s.  And I guess I assumed that rapidly rising living standards made the issue less urgent.  But  I&#8217;d be interested in what you have to say on the matter.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>They sort of moved in that direction through Park&#8217;s dictatorship &#8211; I&#8217;ve seen suggestions that Park&#8217;s first election, in 1963, after his coup, was more or less legitimate. He bribed and intidimated officials, ran strong government-backed propaganda, and constantly harassed and intimidated the opposition to keep them from organizing, but the vote totals weren&#8217;t total fabrications in 67 and 71, either.</p>
<p>The election of 71 was so close, though, that Park worried he actually might lose power if another election were held, no matter how much he bribed or beat people, so he declared a state of emergency, threw out the Third Republic, and instituted the Yushin constitution, which more or less made him President for life &#8211; the President was now elected by an Electoral College, and the Electors were chosen by the President and the Assembly&#8230;and 1/3 of the Assembly was hand-picked by the President. </p>
<p>Most Koreans went along with this because times were good &#8211; the Parks are still revered in large parts of the country even today. His daughter was elected president from 2013-2017 (before toppling in a massive corruption scandal). You had opposition, but it was mostly regionally concentrated, and tied up in ineffective protests, mostly by college students. Usually a bit of tear gas and some good old fashioned billy clubs kept those from getting out of hand (before Gwangju). </p>
<p>Chun Doo-hwan and Gwangju escalating into each other was a big part of why Korea ultimately did transition to democracy in the late &#8217;80s &#8211; early &#8217;90s, and I&#8217;ll get there in a few weeks.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s horrible when people who are directly responsible for many deaths (to prop up themselves) are pardoned of the death penalty.</p>
<p>Chun Doo-hwan should not be alive today. He certainly shouldn&#8217;t be living free.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d heard about this before from a Korean movie about a crazy person who believed the uprising was currently happening during an anniversary celebration of the uprising. I can&#8217;t remember the name of the movie.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I agree that the fact that he is currently not only free but living off his ill-gotten gains is a grotesque failure of justice; however, I don&#8217;t agree with the death penalty. It&#8217;s not like Richard Nixon being pardoned by Gerald Ford, who was Nixon&#8217;s political ally at the time. </p>
<p>Chun was pardoned by Kim Young-Sam and Kim Dae-jung, the two most prominent critics of the military regime (and two of the men directly involved in the 1980 crisis). I think it was an important step in reconciliation in the country, and showed that they were willing to forgive the sins of the past so Korea could move forward with a democratic future. I think measures of grace like that are important for stabilizing divided and turbulent nations &#8211; I&#8217;d point also to Grant&#8217;s generous peace terms for defeated Confederates. </p>
<p>As for the man you mentioned in the movie, I haven&#8217;t seen it, but it sounds like it&#8217;s based on a real case. One prominent fellow in the uprising, Kim [something, my books are elsewhere so I&#8217;ll look up his first name later] was badly injured in the final battle, and suffered a bit of brain damage. He famously wound up in an asylum, where he still talks to his comrades killed during the uprising as if they were still alive and with him. </p>
<p>EDIT: Found the guy. From <i>Laying Claim to the Memory of May:</i></p>
<blockquote><p>Another of those who survived the final assault was Kim Yŏngch’ŏl. Kim, thirty-two years old, married, and the father of three young children, was a political activist before 5.18; he worked with the urban poor through the YWCA credit union movement. When the new leadership was organized on May 25 as the Citizens and Students Struggle Committee, he was appointed planning director, and he was in the Provincial Office Building at dawn on May 27. In the final assault, he suffered contusions on his head and shoulders and while in detention at Sangmudae attempted suicide. Sentenced to twelve years in prison for his role in the uprising, in December 1981 his wife found him at 3 a.m., wandering outside his house, partially paralyzed and mentally deranged. 3 She struggled for several years to keep him at home, but he required constant supervision. He banged his head on the floor and walls, ran naked through the neighborhood, was caught shoplifting, and suffered from delusions. He still imagines that his comrades-in-arms from 1980 are alive and talks about meeting them. Finally, he had to be institutionalized.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how he came to be outside her house after prison &#8211; tortured and then released? The book has lots of good information but also frustrating gaps like that. </p>
<p>There IS a good movie about the uprising, A Taxi Driver, which is VERY loosely based on a true story. Worth a watch if you&#8217;re interested.</p>

<p>This is true. It was important in South Africa reconciliation.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m ambivalent on the death penalty. I desperately hate it though when the more power and responsibility you have the more likely you are to have disproportionately lesser punishment.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>In this first installment of &#8216;Cool Tech That We Had In Past Decades (And Maybe Could Again?)&#8217;, I present the &#8216;land train&#8217;. A manufacturer in the 50s created a series of offroad arctic exploration vehicles for the Army, consisting of interlinked crane or excavator-sized trucks with an engine cab in the front- that (through some kind of diesel to electric generator process?) sent power to all of the wheels of all of the attached vehicles. Hence, a cousin to the train, without tracks. Later versions had multiple cabs with engines, one version with up to four of them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it appears that advances in heavy-lift helicopters made them less practical, but it still seems like an interesting idea for future usage (off Earth, for instance?)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Lack of infrastructure up there to unload and transport the cargo, I&#8217;d imagine. </p>
<p>Even if you could have gotten the stuff up there (doubtful, icebreaking back in the 50s was pretty bad), how do you get it from the hold of your icebreaker (which can only get within a mile or so of shore) to the site where you want your radar station built?</p>
<p>That being said, even getting the cargo vessel up there would have been a challenge. To break that kind of ice you need a dedicated icebreaker, and dedicated icebreakers can&#8217;t carry cargo. Maybe you could run a McMurdo-style operation and have icebreaking escorts for this ship, but that would cost an ungodly amount.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Several tech-savvy folks around here &#8211; I am fresh out of ideas, figured I&#8217;d bounce it off people here to see if anyone has any thoughts. </p>
<p>Myself and everyone in my family have been receiving a ton of spam via text message. These always take the same form &#8211; an email address that is clearly mass-generated (ie, <a rel="nofollow"href="mailto:name37737373@gmail.com">name37737373@gmail.com</a>) sends an email to 20 sequentially generated strings of seven digits, each with @vzwpix.com added to the end. Ie, <a rel="nofollow"href="mailto:5557473001@vzwpix.com">5557473001@vzwpix.com</a>; <a rel="nofollow"href="mailto:5557473002@vzwpix.com">5557473002@vzwpix.com</a>; <a rel="nofollow"href="mailto:5557473003@vzwpix.com">5557473003@vzwpix.com</a>, and so forth. </p>
<p>If you do a Google search for VZWPix, nearly every result that comes back is from people who have been receiving spam text messages like this. A search for &#8220;vzwpix&#8221; on Twitter turns up the same thing &#8211; just person after person tweeting at Verizon Support for help stopping this, with no luck. This has been going on for years, with no hint of a fix.</p>
<p>I have spoken with Verizon Tech Support about this a few times myself, both by chat and phone. They have generally been polite and seemed to genuinely try to help, but have no idea what VZWPix actually is, let alone how to stop emails sent to it from generating text messages on my phone. I spent an hour on the phone with a tech support rep who tried all sorts of stuff and even checked with his supervisor, but were stumped and unable to figure out what VZWPix.com was, since going to the website just says it&#8217;s an invalid site.</p>
<p>I think I figured out why.</p>
<p>Searching old articles and sites, it appears that the functionality to send an email to [phone number]@vzwpix.com and have it sent to your phone as a text message was a feature of Pix Place, a picture hosting service Verizon used to offer. The Pix Place website is picture.vzw.com (and also used to be accessible from VZWPix.com, although that URL is now defunct); go there, and you get this message:</p>
<p><i>The Pix Place Online Album was discontinued on October 1st. For information about setting up a free account on the Verizon Cloud remote storage service, please visit <a rel="nofollow"href="http://www.vzw.com/mmupdate" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.vzw.com/mmupdate</a> from your computer.</i></p>
<p>Researching a bit more, apparently that was October 1st, 2014. Pix Place has been dead and gone for six years, so no wonder that Verizon tech support staff aren&#8217;t getting training or resources about it or how to change any settings for it.</p>
<p>The problem is, Pix Place may be gone, but clearly nobody ever turned off the email to text forwarding that was part of the service &#8211; and nobody I&#8217;ve talked to at Verizon seems to have the faintest idea what I&#8217;m talking about. Spammers have realized Verizon left a backdoor open to send unblockable spam to anyone with a Verizon number, via what appears to be a sort of zombie service that you can&#8217;t log into anymore to change settings, but is still active for every Verizon cell phone account.</p>
<p>I am 100% sure there is a person or person working at Verizon who knows what is up with this, and how to fix it. But I am also pretty sure that no interaction with Verizon Customer Support is ever going to actually get this problem on that person&#8217;s radar.</p>
<p>But I figured I&#8217;d post it here on the off chance anyone has any clever ideas.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>One thing to try first, have you tried emailing to <a rel="nofollow"href="mailto:YOURNUMBER@vzwpix.com">YOURNUMBER@vzwpix.com</a> and seeing if the forwarding happens then? A trivially exploitable flaw will get more attention than one that only is exploitable by some particular thing only the spammer knows how to do.</p>
<p>Two paths that might get a resolution:</p>
<p>1. Reach the Administrative/Technical contacts for that domain. Unfortunately whois doesn&#8217;t give you a direct contact email, just &#8220;Select Request Email Form at <a rel="nofollow"href="https://domains.markmonitor.com/whois/vzwpix.com" rel="nofollow ugc">https://domains.markmonitor.com/whois/vzwpix.com</a>&#8220;, but it&#8217;s still worth going through the process and seeing if you can reach someone there. Explain the situation. In theory, if they remove the MX records for the domain it would stop any spam-forwarding (bit of a blunt instrument, especially if they use actual addresses on the same domain).<br />
2. The MX records say the mailservers are hosted on cloudfilter.net, which is a domain that redirects to cloudmark.com which provides various email/text messaging &#8220;security&#8221; services. They might be more responsive given the risk of a reputational hit if they&#8217;re the ones forwarding spam. If not they might have a way to reach the right people.</p>
<p>Let me know if you hit more roadblocks.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;d be cautious with this.  Depending on how the relevant laws read, this might be equivalent to &#8220;Walk into somebody&#8217;s house in the dead of night and wake them by tickling their ear to demonstrate they&#8217;ve left their front door unlocked.&#8221;  While you&#8217;ll absolutely get the door locked, you *might* not enjoy the legal consequences, and in this metaphor, you&#8217;re *absolutely 100%* guilty of trespassing so it&#8217;ll be trivially easy to charge you.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m a Verizon customer, and I just confirmed that that approach works (even using an email address that is otherwise not associated with my Verizon account). Crazy. I&#8217;m honestly kind of surprised that (a) Verizon hasn&#8217;t closed this obvious loophole and (b) no one has bothered to spam every Verizon customer in the country endlessly (thereby forcing Verizon to close the loophole). It&#8217;s not like sending out spam via email is a novel idea . . . .</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yeah, after researching it some more and reading more online, it seems that the &#8216;VZWPix&#8217; branding was related to Pix Palace, but otherwise this has nothing to do with that, it&#8217;s just that they are still using it as their MMS Gateway. </p>
<p>And unfortunately, they just have no spam protection of any kind on their MMS Gateway, so if someone feels like putting &#8216;@VZWPix.com&#8217; after a zillion strings of seven digit numbers and sending them spam emails, there is basically no way to block constant text message spam. </p>
<p>Cool feature, Verizon!</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s commonly argued that today&#8217;s rich countries are only rich because they extracted wealth from ex-colonies in the past. However, are there any ex-imperial countries whose present wealth almost certainly doesn&#8217;t derive from that source? </p>
<p>For example, consider the former Axis Powers, Germany, Italy and Japan. </p>
<p>Germany and Italy were late to the game, and could only conquer poor parts of the world. (What riches were there in Eritrea and Togo?) I don&#8217;t have economic figures at hand, but I doubt either made much money off of their empires during their relatively brief lives. </p>
<p>WWII saw all three of them lose their empires and have their economies obliterated. Is it fair to say that whatever wealth they might have gained from their colonies was erased, and that everything they have now owes to their labors since 1945, plus donations they received from friendly countries?</p>

Their growth is extremely recent; the Celtic Tiger thing occurred long after imperialism was a thing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m no expert in South Korean history, but I would be surprised to find colonial holdings in their past, given their historical situation between the Chinese, Japanese, and steppe horsemen. They also have, at the very least, a horrific history of colonial oppression under the Japanese. </p>
<p>Other contenders:<br />
I&#8217;m unaware of the Swiss ever having colonial holdings.<br />
I&#8217;ve heard of powerful Swedes, plus there&#8217;s the whole Viking thing, but I don&#8217;t think the Norwegians ever had significant holdings. On this point, probably the Finns as well. I think there&#8217;s a small indigenous group called the Sami in northern Sweden/Norway that might be oppressed but I don&#8217;t think they get as far south as Finland.<br />
Poland is doing okay and I can&#8217;t imagine them holding any imperial possessions in the 19th-20th century. Quite the other way.<br />
Several small states such as Lichtenstien probably technically count but only on technicalities.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Should Taiwan also be on this list? I know it was treated as a backwater while part of the Chinese Empire, so it probably received no additional wealth from that.</p>
<p>If the Japanese built up parts of Taiwan&#8217;s economy during their imperial rule of the island, are today&#8217;s Taiwanese somehow morally complicit with colonialism since they&#8217;re still enjoying some of its benefits? </p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure many of the Nationalists who fled to Taiwan up to 1949 were rich people from the mainland who brought some of their dishonestly-earned wealth with them, but many Nationalists abandoned all their assets and fled to the island with only the clothes on their backs. Do the two groups cancel each other out when deciding whether Taiwan has benefited from colonialism?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I would avoid Taiwan because there is a native Taiwanese population that is&#8230;Chinese but not Han Chinese (ethnicity is odd in China) and was not treated terribly well.</p>
<p>I tried to avoid any country that had a minority native population that was ill-treated in any way, since I&#8217;m assuming a bit of bad-faith behind the real people using this argument. I just can&#8217;t understand how someone could look at Kaiser Wilhelm&#8217;s Germany and think they&#8217;re clearly a world power because of their colonial possessions.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If you look at the biggest &#8220;colonizers&#8221; over the period of say 1400 to 1940 then rank them, say,  by GDP per capita or PPP or something close to that, I am doubtful you&#8217;d find any relationship between the two.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s important because if a non-imperial country like Switzerland is beating a heavily imperial country like the UK then you&#8217;d have to argue that in a just world the UK ought to be even poorer than it is now, at least relative to Switzerland. </p>
<p>In fact the only commodity I think you could steal from a country that would be noticeable in the data would be Oil, since it&#8217;s one of the only commodities that has any explanatory power for GDP. </p>
<p>[The other two big ones being national IQ and whether or not you were a former [or are in NK&#8217;s case] communist country]</p>
<p>If we&#8217;re talking about a situation where you either kill or displace the previous inhabitants (if the area wasn&#8217;t uninhabited before) and literally &#8216;settle&#8217; the land yourself, then you can theoretically chock up 100% of the newly formed countries wealth to colonialism but that&#8217;s 100% &#8216;Horizontally&#8217; &#8212; you don&#8217;t get very far by simply sitting on land you&#8217;ve taken, you still have to put it to good use. And a lot of those countries [US and Commonwealth] end up matching or surpassing the economy of their mother country.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p><i> However, are there any ex-imperial countries whose present wealth almost certainly doesn’t derive from that source?</i></p>
<p>All of them.</p>
<p>For the colonizing powers, colonies were a money sink. Aside from the extraction of gold and silver from the Americas, any money made by the imperial powers net of their costs of conquest and ruling were gains from trade, which would have occurred without conquest. And Spain was famously economically damaged by the enormous flows of gold and silver into its economy &#8211; Spain was not rich when Napoleon put his brother on the throne leading to the loss of its empire. What wealth Spain has is from industrializing beginning shortly before they lost the rest of their empire to the US.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Indeed, you could argue that the influx of gold, silver and other valuable raw materials from the colonies damaged Spain and Portugal in the long term. They just used these natural resources to buy manufactured goods from other European countries and neglected to develop their own industrial sector, they became extractive economies not unlike the modern oil countries, so when the stream of natural resources ran dry they were left undeveloped and poor.</p>
<p>The UK was in a somewhat better position because their colonies provided materials, such as cotton, that required substantial industrial processing to be valuable, so this promoted early industrialization, although they became complacent and let their industry eventually lag at a relatively medium technological level. </p>
<p>In contrast, Germany and the (Northen) US had less access to cheap resources, so they industrialized later but went directly into high tech (e.g. cars, electricity, radio), which eventually paid off.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The bigger problem is causality. Let&#8217;s take for the sake of argument that extraction makes you rich.  If so, how did the colonizers get rich enough to sail across oceans and conquer colonies in the first place?  I mean, maybe you can make a case for Spain massively lucking out, but if so, they should have gone on to conquer the whole damned world.  Instead they got picked apart by the English, dutch, and french.  empire is a consequence of wealth and power, not a cause.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>There were multiple reasons why Spain was rich before the conquest of America. </p>
<p>Spain has very productive agricultural lands; Spain is the natural entry point for trade between the Americas and Europe; Spain controls the Gibraltar strait, a natural choke point for the Mediterranean trade; Spain is relatively isolated from its neighbours* by the Pyrenees (not as good as the British moat, but better than the French eastern border); Spain has, after the Reconquista, remained a religiously and ethnically homogeneous country, except for a few Jews and Moors here and there.</p>
<p>And despite all those advantages, Spain remained poor. All those wars against other European countries were financed with American silver. I wouldn&#8217;t even say that American silver benefitted the Spanish Crown, because, until the War of Spanish Succession, there were nine bankruptcies of the Crown in what should have been the richest period of the Empire: 1557, 1575, 1596, 1607, 1627, 1647, 1652, 1662, and 1666.</p>
<p>The plentiful American silver meant they could engage in all those wasteful wars, keep the Spanish economy from developing, and keep their power despite all their mismanagement.</p>
<p>*Portugal doesn&#8217;t count. It never stood a chance of winning a serious war with Spain, other than an independence war.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>There’s about 200 straight years of EVERYONE fighting the Spanish, and the Spanish coming extremely close to winning.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Bella gerant alii, tu felix Austria nube</p></blockquote>
<p>Spain really only &#8216;won&#8217; in the 16th century &#8211; by the end of Philip II&#8217;s reign she was clearly on the downhill. And most of the Spanish possessions in Europe in that time (hell, <i>Spain itself</i> as the union of Aragon and Castile) came about via marriage, not via American-gold-powered conquest. Most notable, of course, is Charles/Carlos V, who united all Austrian and Spanish possessions under one crown for a few decades.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Why would countries seek empires if not to acquire more wealth and power? You need some minimum level of wealth to gain an empire, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you don&#8217;t get richer once you have one. Being wealthy and powerful also doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t squander an empire once you&#8217;ve acquired one, if you make poor decisions and your rivals make better ones.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>(A) that they seek to acquire more wealth (which is not the same thing as more power) does not mean that they actually do.   </p>
<p>(B) foreign reach expands with grasp, not the other way around.  Today, Micronesia does not aspire to be global hegemon, because they know they can&#8217;t.  But if tomorrow they were magically transformed into the most powerful country on earth, they&#8217;d start to become more interested in the idea.</p>
<p>(C) but spain never got that wealthy.  The Spanish crown had an enormous font of free money, but the english, dutch, and french societies all got richer, and eventually even their monarchs had more money at their disposal than the spanish, despite the free money from the americas.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>A) Yes, definitely true. But I think it&#8217;s safe to say that countries wouldn&#8217;t do it if it was a bad idea.</p>

<p>First, those countries acquired their empires, in large part, by nabbing bits of the Spanish empire, which meant they somehow got powerful enough to beat spain without having much of an empire.  </p>
<p>Second, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d say that spain squandered her empire any more than any other fallen empire did.  Spain certainly could have made better choices, but that&#8217;s always the case.</p>

<p>The settler colonies produced very little revenue for their respective crowns.  the money came from further south, which is why far more effort was spent fighting over the south and east.  And, fwiw, the dutch colonies were largely grabbed at the expense of the Portuguese, who were part of the Spanish empire at the time.</p>

<p>The cost of maintaining the empire in lives and treasure was borne by the tax payer, while the profits of having a monopoly on the nutmeg trade, or whatever, mysteriously accrued to the pockets of politically influential individuals, and this was far easier to get away with in the exotic abroad than similar schemes in the metropole, which would be fought tooth and nail by people ministers of government might actually listen to.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Why would countries seek empires if not to acquire more wealth and power?</p></blockquote>
<p>You can acquire marginally more power through colonies without that being a significant source of wealth or power. The UK might have a giant empire, and might profit by it, but it&#8217;s main source of power was always it&#8217;s domestic industry and military.</p>
<p>This is why a major colonial power like the UK, upon which the sun never set, could have inferior industrial and military might compared to the Germans or Soviets in the World Wars, neither of which had extensive empires. You can get money and prestige from ruling India, and I wouldn&#8217;t turn it down, but I&#8217;d take Bavaria over India any day.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>This is clearly the correct answer. The US did not acquire very many <i>overseas</i> colonies, and most of its colonies were eventually incorporated as states, losing their colonial status, but territorial expansion was absolutely a part of the United States growth and development strategy. I will not claim that the wealth of the United States owes entirely, or even mostly to territorial expansion, but I think there is almost no doubt that westward expansion attracted immigrants, and played a role in growing the US population, which surely contributed something to America&#8217;s economic development.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>This depends on confusion between two definitions of &#8220;colony&#8221;. The US was a settler colony, and its expansion was effectively settler colonies that ended up incorporated into the metropole. </p>
<p>But the stupid Marxist argument that colonies made European countries rich is mostly about imperial colonies, where the colonizing power was ruling other nations, not settling those nations in a significant way.</p>
<p>About the only major impact of an imperial colony on the metropole of the US was California gold providing the North with enough capital to afford to completely overwhelm the Confederacy.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>It’s commonly argued that today’s rich countries are only rich because they extracted wealth from ex-colonies in the past.</p></blockquote>
<p>It should be pretty obvious that large fraction and probably the majority of global economic growth has taken place in countries not having any colonies (Japan, S. Korea, Taiwan, arguably the US, Russia, China, Canada, and so on), that most of the economic growth in colony countries have occurred after colonies were freed (i.e. 20th and 21st century), and that there is no obvious relationship between colony overlords and other nations when it comes to national wealth.  </p>
<p>What is the evidence to the contrary?  If anybody makes this claim, my assumption will be that they are regurgitating some ideological dogma, and not much interested in facts.   Would anybody care to steelman?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Semi-interesting-mostly-depressing unemployment thing/rant:</p>
<p>Arizona never has the best Department of Economic Security staffing levels; I&#8217;ve gotten to physical locations before they opened for the day and been their until after closing time in the past. But Covid unemployment claims have run them absolutely ragged; they don&#8217;t have anywhere near the staff to keep up with the claims.</p>
<p>The practical upshot of this is that I have eight weeks of pending claims and as near as I can tell they haven&#8217;t even looked at the file yet, much less approved anything. I&#8217;m lucky in that I had more money than usual going into this current crisis, so I&#8217;m only running out of money now, but I can&#8217;t imagine what it&#8217;s like for somebody who got fired at the beginning of the crisis who was depending on their next check.</p>
<p>One thing that&#8217;s particularly infuriating/annoying about it is that you can&#8217;t actually talk to them about this; if you call in, they tell you the call queue is full and won&#8217;t even let you be on hold &#8211; this automated message starts immediately after the phone lines &#8220;open&#8221; until they &#8220;close&#8221;. It&#8217;s so bad that I&#8217;ve seen people speculating they aren&#8217;t taking calls at all &#8211; this isn&#8217;t the case, I&#8217;m sure, but it seems like it from the perspective of someone trying to reach them.  They also don&#8217;t answer emails.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Civil service and public service is tricky, though; at the time of our austerity budgets to deal with the aftermath of the 2008 collapse, the <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/89ddb8-croke-park-agreement/?referrer=/en/croke-park-agreement/" rel="nofollow ugc">Croake Park agreement</a> set about reducing the public sector wages bill by a recruitment embargo, so that numbers would be reduced by natural attrition (people retiring or leaving) and would not be replaced, even if the volume of work increased.</p>
<p>This, as you are seeing here, can be a problem.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t really take in and then offload temp workers because (a) it&#8217;s government employment, be that at state or national level, so there are conditions and protections (b) training them to handle cases like processing unemployment claims or other claims involves more than merely &#8220;enter the data from the form into the system&#8221; because there are always tricky parts and edge cases, and this takes time and effort that the permanent staff don&#8217;t have time to give when overwhelmed with new work (c) there may be a legal agreement in place, as with the various agreements in Ireland, that no new staff will be taken on.  Though by the state jobs board, they are looking for people as <a rel="nofollow"href="https://azstatejobs.azdoa.gov/" rel="nofollow ugc">temporary staff</a>, so that should help.</p>
<p>When you want to cut public sector expenses and costs, reducing staff is one way of doing it.  But service provision suffers, and you&#8217;re seeing it here in action.  Remember this the next time you hear someone complaining that the public sector is over-staffed with drones who do nothing because they know they can&#8217;t be fired and it should be run like a business, lean and mean! 🙂</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;d hope that if the state&#8217;s unemployment system is actually still entering data by had, they could hire temps or a contractor to do *all* the data entry and other routine processing (verification letters to employers, etc), then have their regular staff handle all the tricky parts and edge cases. (I think California does most of the fully routine stuff by computer.)</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s *hard* to hire new people or temps or a contract. If a state figured out they&#8217;d need to do that, it would be a near-miracle if a contractor could start within 90 days of the state deciding to do that, between advertising for contractors, selecting one or more, writing contracts, etc.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>So, there are two big outrage stories in the news right now.</p>
<p>In the first, two Manhattanites got into an altercation into a park because one of them, a white woman, wasn&#8217;t leashing her dog.  She refused to leash it, the (black, gay) man argued and tried to lure her dog away with snacks, and the woman freaked out and called the cops in a racially inflammatory manner, emphasizing how African-American the man threatening her was.  The man caught it on his smartphone, and now the lady is fired, the dog confiscated, and the guy has had to go on air telling people to stop sending this woman death threats.</p>
<p>The other outrage story also involves a black guy, George Floyd.  The cops got called in on a forgery beef, and wound up knocking Floyd to the ground and literally kneeling on his neck for several minutes while he struggled and complained that he couldn&#8217;t breathe.  This, too, was caught on camera, in broad daylight, while bystanders repeatedly urged the officers to let him go because he was being strangled.  The officers did not get off the man&#8217;s neck until EMS arrived.  Floyd died shortly after arriving at the hospital.  All officers involved have been fired and the matter has been reported to the FBI.</p>
<p>The weird thing is, my FB feed seems to be on fire because of the first incident, which caused no physical harm to anyone.  The second seems to have effectively given a horribly painful form of summary execution to a suspect for a totally nonviolent offense, but there&#8217;s a lot less heat over it.  The outrage is disproportionately weighted towards the much less alarming incident.  Is this anybody else&#8217;s experience, and if so, why do you think this is?</p>
<p>My guess is that it&#8217;s because the second incident is totally indefensible.  Even people who are totally in the cops&#8217; corner for most things have a hard time defending them putting their weight on a man&#8217;s neck for almost eight minutes while he lay on the ground, and events were caught on camera and can&#8217;t even be disputed.  This means it can&#8217;t feed internet drama, though there apparently has been at least one riot about it.  In the first incident, by contrast, both parties were acting kind of obnoxious and it just got out of hand, so you can have a protracted argument about white privilege versus oppression olympics and blah blah blah.</p>
<p>Is there a less depressing take on it?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Depends on your feed I guess. Mine had only a couple posts about the Cooper incident, much more about George Floyd.</p>
<p>(Although, lest you get too much of your faith restored in humanity, the posts about Floyd are at least 50% about how the mostly black protesters are getting harsher treatment than the mostly white anti lockdown protesters, rather than the death of Floyd itself, which I have yet to see anyone seriously defend. Scott has written previously about how controversial events always tend to stoke more outrage than things that are more heinous, but for precisely that reason, less likely to stoke culture warring)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yeah, immediately after I posted this I saw two people share a meme sarcastically comparing cop-kneeling-on-throat to Colin Kaepernick.  A third complained about how white shutdown protesters get nicer treatment, like you said.  It&#8217;s really fucking annoying how everything gets reinterpreted through culture war as opposed to &#8220;I think that cop just violated half the Bill of Rights in one act.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Err, correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, because I will be the first to admit I haven&#8217;t been following this closely, but I was under the impression that events in Minneapolis had already spiraled past &#8220;mass protests&#8221; and were rapidly escalating towards &#8220;riots&#8221;, with at least a few isolated (so far) incidents of arson (an Autozone) and looting (a Target) already. That would seem to explain at least some of the difference in response.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Well yes. That’s why it makes for better controversy. You can post pictures of sympathetic looking protesters in the aftermath of a tear gassing while ignoring the context of smashed cop car windows and looted Targets, then contrast with pictures of angry looking lockdown protesters yelling while having guns (or flip that around, as your narrative prefers).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I wish I had a more positive take, but I think you nailed it.</p>
<p>It sounds like the local response to the second incident may have been stronger. If that&#8217;s true, that might be sort of ideal. The national reach some stories of nasty behavior have is definitely not ideal.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think your take is the right one. Scott wrote<a rel="nofollow"href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/"> a good post </a>on something I&#8217;d say is pretty close to this dynamic.</p>
<p>Because of this, I avoid following these these controversies as much as possible&#8212;they derange everything. So I can&#8217;t speak to how these specific incidents compare, but my past experience indicates this is very much the case. </p>
<p>Of course, some of these incidents actually matter and shouldn&#8217;t be ignored, but level of social media outrage  is not at all well-correlated with the worthiness of the cause, or even true public opinion. And it&#8217;s clear a lot of people make money or otherwise benefit from using them to escalate outrage, and that the rest of us waste our time trying to reason through something fundamentally unreasonable by standards other than maximizing outrage.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Ironically, that post ends with a remark about nobody hating bird-watchers yet.  The black guy in the park fight was a bird-watcher.  He was irritated because the white lady wasn&#8217;t leashing her dog in the special bird preserve part of the park.  So just wait for it.  Soon enough bird-watching shall be progressive while walking dogs shall be the exclusive domain of privileged white Karens.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m pretty sure it won&#8217;t change anything (the video evidence is quite horrible), but we&#8217;ll know for sure when the body cam footage gets released.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t imagine anything that would justify this, but I still think trying to get the facts before discussing it is one of the reasons why the SSC community works.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Did they have body cams? If so, that makes this much worse on an institutional level, because before the video from bystanders hit social media, the department issued a statement describing the official version of the incident that we know now is an absolute fabrication:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;After he got out, he physically resisted officers,” police spokesman John Elder told reporters early Tuesday. “Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and officers noticed that the man was going into medical distress.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a rel="nofollow"href="https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/05/26/george-floyd-man-dies-after-being-arrested-by-minneapolis-police-fbi-called-to-investigate/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/05/26/george-floyd-man-dies-after-being-arrested-by-minneapolis-police-fbi-called-to-investigate/</a></p>
<p>Now, if all they had to go on was the reports of the officers, who are clearly going to lie, and then once the video came out they fired them and started an investigation &#8211; fair enough. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if they had body cam footage, that means that the police department leadership knew it was a murder and actively tried to cover it up, and only changed tactics once the video came out.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&gt; I can’t imagine anything that would justify this</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I haven&#8217;t watched the videos. I&#8217;ve purposefully not read anything about this yet.</p>
<p>However, as someone in EMS I&#8217;ve occasionally dealt with people who&#8217;ve decided to encounter medical complaints right about the time they they are being arrested. In my case, it usually involves women shoplifting who are suddenly worried about miscarrying. But I digress.</p>
<p>If people resisting arrest discovered that yelling &#8220;I can&#8217;t breathe&#8221; was a way to get themselves leverage to once again attempt to flee, you can imagine that the police would start to ignore such complaints even if this particular person was being honest because the police wouldn&#8217;t have any way to separate the two in the moment.</p>

<p>Yes, there were body cams, and the footage was released today. So it does seem like the police report lied.</p>
<p>@Garrett</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been in self-defense classes. While I was taught a few tricks to get out of a choke or squiggle out of being below somebody, there is pretty much nothing a person laying on their belly with their hands handcuffed behind them can do to somebody applying weight to their back. Not even a strong man like George Floyd.</p>
<p>If the officers were applying weight to Floyd&#8217;s back, and he started yelling he couldn&#8217;t breathe, not believing him would be understandable. But he was saying he couldn&#8217;t breathe while they were applying pressure to his airways. A reasonable person would release his airway.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not even saying the police shoudn&#8217;t choke people. There might be situations when a choke might be the best way to pacify a violently unreasonable person. But once that person is laying on their belly with their hands handcuffed, not even a strong man like George Floyd can do much. Not against one, much less four, officers.</p>

<p>The point is, he didn&#8217;t die because he suddenly developed a medical complaint &#8211; that was (apparently) a lie on the behalf of the police department. Then a bunch of videos from passersby came out, and it turned out the &#8220;medical condition&#8221; that developed was a cop kneeling on his throat until he choked to death, while he was putting up no resistance no more severe than begging for his life.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>But he was saying he couldn’t breathe while they were applying pressure to his airways.</p></blockquote>
<p>To the airways?  From the videos, it looks like he is lying side/face down against the car, and the kne is applied to the neck behind his ear.  While I&#8217;m sure it is uncomfortable and probably¹ unnecessarily brutal, I wouldn&#8217;t expect him to choke or otherwise suffer permanent harm from it.  Maybe if the officer did a knee drop to his neck, he could break or otherwise damage the spinal cord?  I&#8217;m curious what the autopsy will say.</p>
<p>¹  I couldn&#8217;t find any video showing exactly how he ended up on the ground.  Anyone?  From other videos, he seems to be passively resisting the cops trying to get him out of the car, and there&#8217;s an incident where he is walked towards a car by the cops and suddenly drops to the ground for no apparent reason &#8211; this could be a stroke or more passive resistance.</p>
<blockquote><p>The point is, he didn’t die because he suddenly developed a medical complaint </p></blockquote>
<p>You can&#8217;t know that.</p>
<blockquote><p>A reasonable person would release his airway.</p></blockquote>
<p>Agreed.</p>

<p>Since you have EMS experience, maybe you can clear up a few things for me.</p>
<p>Is somebody being able to say &#8220;I can&#8217;t breathe&#8221; evidence that they can in fact breathe, since it takes air to speak? Or is there some dangerous point where you can speak, but not get enough oxygen for the brain?</p>
<p>How easy is it to accidentally choke somebody to death? I used to think it was hard, and assumed the guy they killed for selling cigarettes had some other underlying issues going on, but this more recent guys looks like he was pretty healthy.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not an EMT, but people typically don&#8217;t exhale the last of their breath before inhaling. It seems intuitive that it&#8217;s muscularly easier to expel that last breath over an obstruction to speak than to inhale air over the same obstruction to breathe.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Jaskologist</p>
<p>Not an EMT, but I can answer your questions:<br />
1. If you can talk, you must have breathed at some point relatively recently.  You don&#8217;t exhale 100% of your intake (reserve capacity in lungs.) It&#8217;s absolutely possible to talk briefly without being able to breathe&#8211;you&#8217;re just exhaling stored air over your vocal cords. But not for long, unless you have great lung capacity.  </p>
<p>2. If you know what you&#8217;re doing, and have a compliant subject, not difficult at all. If you don&#8217;t know where to place pressure, of if the subject is fighting back, it&#8217;s much more difficult if not impossible. Necks are pretty strong, but the carotid is relatively close to the surface and accessible. HOWEVER, you have to keep the choke on once the person passes out. If you release the choke right after, typically the body can figure the rest out and pull oxygen in (anecdotally).</p>

you can see Floyd is being escorted towards a car by two officers, he walks unsteadily, falters, and then collapses.  I can&#8217;t see any action by the cops that could have caused it, so I think he actually did suffere a stroke or other sudden medical issue.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t excuse the rough treatment, of course.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think this is right.  And it&#8217;s not just clickbait&#8211;nobody is having a discussion about whether the cops should kneel on your throat till you die&#8211;there&#8217;s not much controversy, just everyone agreeing that it&#8217;s really hard to imagine a justification for this and that&#8217;s probably why the cop who did it got fired.</p>
<p>The bird watcher/dog walker conflict has at least some ambiguity and so points of discussion.</p>
<p>Back when ISIS was a going concern, they would periodically release a video where they murdered a captive in some horrible way.  There was similarly not much juice in discussing this, because it&#8217;s hard to find anyone who thinks beheading your helpless, pleading captives with a knife is anything other than barbaric and evil.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I was coming here to make the same point. The case in Florida where someone charges a guy with a gun and gets shot after engaging in suspicious and quasi criminal activity. There was clearly some overactive use of citizens arrest etc, but fundamentally guy charges someone with a gun and unsurprisingly gets shot. That generates a lot of news.<br />
Police should be charged to a grand jury with among other things, manslaughter and maybe murder(the lack of motive makes this seem more like manslaughter) and we should let the courts handle it. We get almost nothing. I am considering pretending to believe it is because the media want to ensure an impartial jury.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Most states have a merger doctrine that ends up meaning the felony needs to be distinct from the putative murder. This primarily means that assault can not be be the felony that grounds felony murder charges. This can lead to weird conclusions<br />
 but not having also leads to weird conclusions.<br />
Not sure about what the relevant Minnesota law- jurisprudence is or if there is a way to get some non merging charge to amount to a felony. Further investigation into motive might turn up a non merging felony, like this being part of a broader extortion racket.<br />
Looking at Minnesota law specifically they are one of the few states that has third degree murder, which seems apt here. &#8220;09.195 MURDER IN THE THIRD DEGREE.<br />
(a) Whoever, without intent to effect the death of any person, causes the death of another by perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life, is guilty of murder in the third degree and may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than 25 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>But ultimately this seems like a question for the Minnesota court system and jury to handle.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think that&#8217;s the maximum. Sentencing guidelines are a thing, and nobody gets the maximum unless they&#8217;re something like a 6 time felon and there&#8217;s aggravating circumstances. I have no idea what the Minnesota guidelines say, but if I had to pull a number from my rectum it would be something like 6-8 years for someone with no previous record, like a cop.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Is there a less depressing take on it?</p></blockquote>
<p>My slightly more optimistic take is that it might be because one is totally indefensible but in a different way. Rather than <a rel="nofollow"href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/">Toxoplasmosa of Rage</a> explanation, the second incident is like children dying of malaria: it&#8217;s so obviously terrible that everyone already agrees it is. Shouting &#8220;CHILDREN DYING IS BAD&#8221; won&#8217;t change anyone&#8217;s mind because they already agree with you, so there&#8217;s no point. The first one on the other hand has just enough grey in it that your Facebook feed sees it and thinks &#8220;Someone out there might not agree with me on this. I need to shout at them until they do!&#8221; There doesn&#8217;t need to actually be disagreement about whether the incident was bad, merely the possibility of disagreement is enough to generate preemptive condemnation. Is your feed actually <i>arguing</i> about it, or just being loudly upset?</p>

<p>Or in my case, I’m seeing more George Floyd, but it’s focusing on the most controversial areas (defending the peaceful(?) protesters and arguing they are treated worse than violent(?) white protesters, trotting out the usual “white people need to feel really bad about this because the shithead cop shared a skin color with them” stuff that is bound to create Rage)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I know SSC isn&#8217;t representative, but when we discussed the bird watcher/dog walker event last OT, the only major points of contention were the severity of her punishment and what if any culpability the bird watcher had for instigating the confrontation and messing with her dog.

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Well, as I said I didn’t get a ton of posts about the Cooper affair. The only ones I really saw were a couple of memes that basically reduced it to “Racist Karen calls cops on man for bird-watching while black”. So not so good there. But those were the “militant lefties”. The generally left-liberal crowd didn’t post anything about it. FWIW I read Jesse Singal and his take was pretty moderate and echoed what you saw here. I think a lot of liberals who actually looked at the issue in any meaningful way reached similar conclusions. </p>
<p>On Floyd, the left-liberal crowd is more t“this is really sad, #blacklivesmatter”, the FB warriors are the ones posting the “police are racists in their handling of the protests” stuff.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Not sure I agree with the premise. The video of the Bird Watcher and the Dog Owner never made it to my feed, only some vaguebook comments about how great and noble it is that racists lose their jobs. </p>
<p>The image of the Minnesota death is definitely spreading, and rapidly, because it has been paired with a picture of the former SF QB also kneeling, which is quite memeable. </p>
<p>I am personally excited, because this is another opportunity to explain why that particular QB is a crappy, low-skill QB, which is why he can&#8217;t get hired in a glut market where Andy Dalton is a backup and Super Bowl MVP, Heisman-winner Cam Newton can&#8217;t get a contract (injury related, to be sure, but if you are hurting that bad for a QB, you would take a chance on him, if there weren&#8217;t other options available).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s crazy how many &#8211; if not amazing &#8211; at least <i>talented</i> QBs are out there now. For like the first time in recent memory, it feels like every team at least <i>thinks</i> it has an answer at what is possibly the most difficult position to play well in all of sports. Some of them are almost certainly wrong (I feel the Chargers will regret drafting Herbert, and it&#8217;s not like Tyrod Taylor&#8217;s gonna be the guy), but the fact that the Raiders have Marcus Mariota as a <i>backup</i> is insane.</p>
<p>Did Kap not get hired because of his politics? Well, maybe. But it&#8217;s more a case of his politics making a fringe QB unemployable &#8211; the straw that breaks the camel&#8217;s back &#8216;coz he&#8217;s otherwise nothing special. If he&#8217;d been Patrick Mahomes or even Dak Prescott he&#8217;d almost certainly be a starter, kneeling or no. Antonio Brown got a job last season, for goodness&#8217; sake.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Toxoplasma of rage.  Central Park is relatively controversial with enough grey area to generate a legitimate debate.  George Floyd is pretty cut and dry.  Even Stefan Molyneux of all people is saying &#8220;yeah this was pretty clearly unjustified murder.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>What I&#8217;m seeing on my FB page is plenty of both. I have a moderate number of black friends, and my page tends blue/moderate SJW.</p>
<p>The George Floyd murder amplifies the dog walker story.</p>
<p>Some of the George Floyd material isn&#8217;t so much controversy as linking to professionals saying that knee-on-neck is unacceptable endangerment.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen very little about the protests, which is actually kind of surprising.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>There looked to be enough looting and recreational arson that people may be a little hesitant to show footage from it, since it could be taken as criticism of the protesters (I realize there&#8217;s only partial or maybe no overlap between the protesters and looters).</p>

I just skipped through it, but it&#8217;s pretty bad. Much worse than my impression of things based on news articles I&#8217;d read up until now.<br />

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Talk about the protests just popped up today. In the following order:<br />
1. The protests are being unfairly and brutally suppressed, unlike white people protesting COVID who are privilged.<br />
2. The protests turning into riots are because of the city&#8217;s poor behavior.<br />
3. People of Color is an insensitive term, you must use the term BIPOC for Black, Indigenous People of Color. This is news to me, learn something new everyday!<br />
4. Amusingly, POC being used as an adjective is in fact insensitive. You cannot  say &#8220;POC Bloggers,&#8221; but you must say &#8220;bloggers of color.&#8221; It is obviously nonsensical to use the terms &#8220;bloggers of black, indigenous, of color,&#8221; so it is permissible to use BIPOC as an adjective even though POC is insensitive to use an adjective. </p>
<p>Plus throwing in how COVID is all Trump&#8217;s fault. </p>
<p>The libertarians are saying that you should obviously protest armed, the cops are obviously not your friends, and you obviously should not be burning shit down unless you intend to actually water the tree of liberty.</p>

One point not mentioned above is that part of &#8220;white people protesting COVID who are privileged&#8221; that I&#8217;m seeing is &#8220;White people protesting COVID and carried weapons were not treated by the police as dangerous, compared to how they justified their attacks on the unarmed Floyd protesters as feeling in danger.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think the less depressing take is that twitter is not real life. The meatspace response to the second incident has been much stronger; in addition to Minneapolis there was a sizable protest in LA. The even more depressing take is that the only way to make sure something gets on people&#8217;s feeds is to respond strongly enough that it gets polarized again.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure what you&#8217;re saying here. Why is it important for Floyd&#8217;s case to get on people&#8217;s feeds? Immediately after the event happened the officers were fired, and they&#8217;re being investigated (including by the FBI and DOJ at the personal request of the President of the United States), and will probably be charged with some type of murder. The wheels of justice appear to be turning just fine.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Without results from the autopsy, I don&#8217;t think there is evidence that Floyd <i>didn&#8217;t</i> die from some medical issue.</p>
<p>The knee to the neck appears to be applied with force, but I don&#8217;t see how it can choke the arteries or windpipe from that position.  Agonal breathing can be due to<br />
cardiac arrest, but Floyd was young and appear fairly healthy &#8211; so maybe a ruptured aneurism?  Or if caused by the knee, perhaps damage to the spinal cord, or head trauma from hitting the asphalt, car, or nightstick.</p>
<p>AFAIK, we don&#8217;t see the actual takedown or how he ended up against the car, and the earlier fall was a couple of seconds from far away &#8211; so we don&#8217;t know if he simply stumbled, fainted from the alleged condition, or was knocked down by one of the cops.</p>

<p>The officers were wearing body cams, so that is a point in favor of the cover-up having been in fact a cover-up. The investigation by the DoJ only came after bystander videos were released, so it appears to me that the police department had footage of what went down and declined to even conduct an internal investigation.</p>

<p>Doesn&#8217;t sound very plausible to me &#8211; in martial arts, you get this situation a lot, and it doesn&#8217;t tend to stop people from breathing.  Instead, you try to get a chokehold, constraining the throat.  OTOH, from the videos it looks like there were several cops weighing him down, and Floyd was probably nowhere near MA shape.</p>
<p>This looks very similar to Eric Garner, who apparently died from a severe asthma attack (arguably) triggered by a chokehold.  The cop was not punished in court, but lost his job five years later because of the incident, IIRC.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>General pessimism, long history of police not being convicted (this is the third suspicious killing by this officer, and he&#8217;s just now been fired), the fact the police was on duty and restraining someone suspected of a crime, and the fact the prosecutor already seems to be tempering expectations. I expect an argument that he didn&#8217;t mean to kill Floyd, that he feared for his life, that he made a tactical decision in a tense moment, that the crowd was distracting/threatening, that the victim was resisting arrest, that the act of resisting was what caused the damage that killed him, that there was some underlying medical issue that played a role&#8230;</p>
<p>The clearest parallel is probably the Garner case, which was charged (though we don&#8217;t know for what), but not indicted; fired, but the cop is suing for his job back. I hope I&#8217;m wrong, though.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>I don’t expect such an argument to be made, because who believes otherwise?</p></blockquote>
<p>Certainly, just noting that it&#8217;s required to make the argument that what he was doing was a reasonable use of force. He wasn&#8217;t intending to kill him, just restrain him. Restraining can be a required part of police work. There is a legal/cultural idea that anything the police do in in the course of police work is legal, or at worst something like misconduct in office.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think it depends on the cause of death? If the autopsy reveals that the CoD was injury caused by the cops, I belive (and hope!) the cop or cops will be convicted of causing his death &#8211; but probably not murder.  If it turns out that Floyd suffered a stroke and died while in custody, I think the chances of any conviction is smaller.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The time has come to get a new phone, and I figured this might be a good place to get info.</p>
<p>Parameters:<br />
Phone must be Android.  This isn&#8217;t negotiable, as I&#8217;m in the Android ecosystem, and I don&#8217;t want to hand control of my digital life to Steve Job&#8217;s ghost.<br />
I don&#8217;t need a high-end phone.  I mostly use it for web browsing, reading, and Pokemon Go.  (Blame Lord Nelson for that, but it&#8217;s a requirement.)   But I&#8217;m also not into paying high-end prices.  I&#8217;d rather not go much over $300 or so.<br />
I&#8217;d prefer something that will last at least 2 years.  My current phone is that old, and it&#8217;s doing OK, but the battery is starting to go.  Definitely don&#8217;t want something that will die on me unexpectedly.  (That&#8217;s happened before.  It&#8217;s not fun.)</p>
<p>My current phone is a Motoroloa of some sort, and barring anything else, I&#8217;ll probably go with them.</p>
<p>Advice?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I got a Motorola power G7 a year ago, and I&#8217;m very happy with it.  It was cheap, it has enormous battery life, has an audio jack, and does everything else you&#8217;d expect.  the only issue was a relatively small hard drive, but the power g8 fixed that.</p>

<p>Phenomenal battery life and a top of the line camera. Can&#8217;t speak to 2 years, but i&#8217;ve had it for 10 months and am still perfectly happy with it (though I think I need to replace the charger, which has gotten finicky).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>When I last bought a phone, the Pixel 3 was on sale for the same cost as the pixel 3a, and the salesperson said it was slightly better (though not in ways that might justify higher cost). I really like my pixel 3, and would imagine the 3a is also excellent.</p>
<p>Edit: It looks like the pixel 3a is on sale for 279, while the pixel 3 is still slightly above 400. At that cost, 3a all the way.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Count me as another happy owner of a pixel 3a. I selected it for size &#8211; I wanted a phone that was physically fairly small &#8211; but I&#8217;ve also been incredibly happy with its battery life. (I easily get more than 2 days on a charge, which I wouldn&#8217;t believe if I didn&#8217;t regularly see it.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I bought a pixel 3 right when the pixel 4 came out and have been very happy with it. My biggest complaint is a minor, seemingly known issue with the brightness adjust. When it&#8217;s in automatic the screen brightness will change for seemingly no reason, brightening or dimming without any change in the phone&#8217;s position or the ambient lighting. This only happens occasionally though and you can always turn off the feature and adjust brightness manually.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I had no idea! (By obscure, I meant why one could blame the actual Lord Nelson for you playing Pokemon Go, and imagined some tale about his life that would be relevant, such as him charging the decks of a Spanish warship in order to acquire a rare Absol)</p>
<p>Random Pokemon story: Several years ago, we were having a get together in our house, with all the familes&#8217; kids playing downstairs. We were shocked to hear our 8 year old daughter yelling a curse word at the top of her lungs, but when I went down to investigate, she explained that she was yelling the name of a Pokemon. I googled it, and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m familiar with Absol.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My current phone is a Huawei P9 light. I got it in late 2016 and it&#8217;s still going strong, even the battery still easily lasts all day. It also takes nice pictures I don&#8217;t remember the exact price, but it was under 400. So I can certainly recommend a low-end Huawei phone, with the caveat that I&#8217;m not sure what the current situation is with Google not supporting them. Maybe this has been resolved? Another caveat is that, if you&#8217;re very concerned about Chinese tech stealing your data, this is probably not the brand for you.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Motorola G something: cheap, lots of phone for the money, pretty much standard Android.<br />
Huawei Mate 20 Pro: slighly expensive, great camera and screen, slightly annoying UI even after resetting as much as I could, no audio jack, and I don&#8217;t like the curved edges.</p>
<p>In general, you can get good phones at low cost if you&#8217;re willing to compromise a little on screen (LCD instead of AMOLED) and camera.</p>
<p>BTW: we&#8217;ve had OLED TVs and mobile phones, but no computer screens.  Why?</p>

<p>And this observation correlates well to which countries are seeing higher and lower CFRs (because, apparently, men in different countries are significantly more or less likely to have relatively long ring fingers).</p>

<p>In my field (bionanotechnology), I have noticed a lot more papers recently about the protein corona of nanoparticles. This has nothing to do with coronavirus, but somebody is clearly thinking that the word &#8221;corona&#8221; will get more people to look at papers.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I can&#8217;t quite tell from this story if they actually studied the digit ratio for the men who survived/died. It appears that they just did a regression analysis of nation-level fatality rate against nation-level digit ratio. If the fatality rate differences based on digit ratio are driving the fatality rate differences by nation, then the fatality rate differences based on digit ratio would have to be huge in order to show up at the national level, given that the single standard deviation interval of digit ratio in each country is heavily overlapping.</p>

<p>But I thought that was also supposed to correlate with being male, and men appear substantially more likely to die of C-19 than women, which would suggest the opposite result.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My point was that the finger ratio signals the mix of hormones in the womb the person was incubated in, with the longer ring finger corresponding to a mix less like that in a womb containing a female fetus. So a male with a longer ring finger is, arguably, &#8220;more male&#8221; than one with a shorter ring finger, as supposedly shown by things like relative performance on math tests vs verbal tests. </p>
<p>Since males are more likely to die of Covid than females, one might expect that &#8220;more male&#8221; males would be more likely to die than &#8220;less male&#8221; males, which is the opposite of the reported result.</p>

<p> This assumption does not appear to be correct, AFAICT. The sex chromosomes you have appear to strongly influence how you respond to any given mix of hormones.</p>

<p>Biology is a damn sight more complex than that. I would caution anyone against applying that kind of simplistic logic to any kind of medical data. You&#8217;re just as likely to be wrong in a variety of unexpected ways as right.</p>

<p>Aren&#8217;t males just in general more likely to die of everything? Except maybe childbirth?</p>
<p>Honest question &#8211; my prior is that nearly everything is worse if you&#8217;ve got a Y chromosome.</p>

<blockquote><p>my prior is that nearly everything is worse if you’ve got a Y chromosome</p></blockquote>
<p>While I share your overall impression, I suspect the real dividing line is not the presence of a Y chromosome, but the absence of a second X chromosome. </p>
<p>I.e. those rare people who are XXY (males with Klinefelter syndrome) or X (females with Turner syndrome) rather than X or XY, <i>might</i> statistically have experiences more like the opposite sex (same X status) rather than the same sex (same Y status) &#8211; except it would be hard to tell, because they also have their own specific problems.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think the problem is clearly that someone came up with something that looked super sleek as a concept on a svelte manikin, and it doesn’t translate well to a functional suit on an actual human.</p>
<p>When it first came out people were ogling over how all the buttons and connectors are incorporated smoothly into the suit (such as the umbilical connector panel and the release buttons for the helmet). Which looks nice but isn’t that dangerous? Like, you want the functional components to be big and obvious in case you or somebody else needs to operate them in an emergency, right? And there are clearly lots of things that are “design elements” rather than functional. </p>
<p>I’m sure NASA got happy with the tests that were done on them to verify their safety, but if I were strapping in I’d feel some vague unease that the desire for a cool form had somehow compromised the function.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>As far as I can tell, either no one has written and published a novel named &#8220;Trigonometry&#8221;, or someone has and it is really obscure*. Let&#8217;s fix that. Who should we hire to write a novel with that title, and what should it be about?</p>
<p>[*] I was able to find a short story named &#8220;Spherical Trigonometry&#8221;, by Ken Asamatsu, in the collection &#8220;Cthulhu&#8217;s Reign&#8221;, but nothing named just &#8220;Trigonometry&#8221;.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s a sequel to Flatland. We follow a narrow-pointed triangle who suffers from the injustices of being judged inferior based on his angle measurements. Eventually, he joins a revolutionary group that seeks to overthrows the existing social order, and establish a more just one. They succeed, and at the end we see what the new just society is your station is determined by your perimeter.</p>
<p>Speaking of mathematical titles, I recently read David Brin&#8217;s <i>Existence</i> and wish he wrote a sequel titled <i>Uniqueness</i>. If he wanted to, he could also write <i>Continuity</i> to round off the <i>Well-posedness Trilogy</i></p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s a boring John Updike novel about some male math professor who is unhappy in his marriage and fantasizing about some attractive female student. He is constantly obsessing about the ratios of the measurements of everyone in this love triangle (particularly the women&#8217;s breast sizes but maybe his own penis size too).</p>
<p>Also, this reminds me of the classic Tom Lehrer bit:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am never forget the day my first book is published.<br />
Every chapter I stole from somewhere else.<br />
Index I copy from old Vladivostok telephone directory.<br />
This book was sensational!<br />
Pravda &#8211; well, Pravda &#8211; Pravda said: (Russian double-talk)<br />
It stinks.<br />
But Izvestia! Izvestia said: (Russian double-talk)<br />
It stinks.<br />
Metro-Goldwyn-Moskva buys movie rights for six million rubles,<br />
Changing title to &#8220;The Eternal Triangle&#8221;,<br />
With Brigitte Bardot playing part of hypotenuse.<br />
And who deserves the credit?<br />
And who deserves the blame?<br />
Nicolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky is his name</p></blockquote>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Suicide in the Plague Year.</p>
<p>Kind of hoping for some input from Scott on this, because it&#8217;s something he might have firsthand knowledge about.  Obviously there are going to be mental health effects due to both the coronavirus itself and the lockdown reaction to same, and this will include some finite number of suicides.  Until yesterday, I had thought that this could be no more than a minor second-order effect, because if it were serious, it would be blatantly obvious.</p>
<p>But then I see <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.nationalreview.com/news/a-years-worth-of-suicide-attempts-in-the-last-four-weeks-california-doctor-calls-for-end-to-lockdown/" rel="nofollow ugc">this</a>, alleging a year&#8217;s worth of suicide attempts in four weeks.  OK, that&#8217;s one local doctor&#8217;s take, and presumably cherrypicked by <i>The National Review</i> for best supporting their preferred narrative.  But there&#8217;s also the <i>San Francisco Examiner</i>, claiming a pre-coronavirus week&#8217;s worth of high-risk calls to suicide hotlines <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Suicide-hotlines-seeing-an-increase-in-calls-for-15200885.php" rel="nofollow ugc">every day</a>.  I&#8217;m pretty sure the Examiner and the Review have very different preferred narratives re coronavirus and lockdown, but they&#8217;re both coming up with a roughly order of magnitude increase in suicides.  Both focused on the Bay Area, so not clear whether this is a local thing or a global effect that was just noticed first in SF.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s a thing at all.  Obviously, if it were real it would have to show up in the statistics, right?  But, per <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2020-05-22/experts-warn-of-a-surge-of-suicides-tied-to-the-coronavirus-pandemic" rel="nofollow ugc">US News &amp; World Report</a>, &#8220;Suicide data is also notoriously slow to materialize, meaning it will likely be years before hard numbers are available on the number of deaths by suicide during the early months of COVID-19&#8221;.  And I can&#8217;t find anything better.  We&#8217;d expect an order of magnitude increase in suicides to show up in overall mortality statistics, but looking at those there&#8217;s excess mortality well beyond official COVID-19 deaths which everybody seems to assume are just undiagnosed COVID-19.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very skeptical that there&#8217;s been an order of magnitude increase in suicide rates that has gone mostly unnoticed until now.  But I&#8217;m also skeptical that a world that can give daily updates on COVID-19 deaths in every country on Earth, can&#8217;t get out at least a rough count of suicides in less than two years.  So, A: is there anyplace where any sort of vaguely hard-ish data on this, and B: what is the boots-on-the-ground view from the Bay Area psychiatric community on what is actually happening?</p>

<p>Aren&#8217;t in-person by friends or family interventions much more successful than suicide hotlines or whatever?</p>
<p>If people aren&#8217;t around friends and family (or even coworkers) as much, there are less opportunities for bystanders to intervene.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m also curious about this, from a slightly different angle. Perhaps my ingroup is just abnormal, but I used to have frequent suicidal thoughts, and many of my friends used to have frequent suicidal thoughts, and we would never have dreamed of calling a hotline. </p>
<p>The unspoken rule was to only call a hotline as the very last resort, because we&#8217;d heard too many horror stories of hotlines / 911 / etc making things worse.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Pollsters have reported much greater willingness of people to talk on the phone to strangers during this weird period.

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I can feel it as well in different parts of my body. Sometimes I use it to count my breathing while meditating (e.g. 4 in 8 out). My blood pressure is on the lower side. I would argue that your resting hear rate is more important. If it is lower your heart is usually stronger and presumably the strokes should be stronger.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@rocoulm:<br />
&gt; Can you guys “feel” your own pulse?</p>
<p>Yes, but usually only if either relaxed and attentive, or shortly after heavy exertion.  I think I&#8217;ve always been aware of the &#8220;exertion&#8221; case, but it wasn&#8217;t until I started doing some competitive target shooting in high school that learned to notice my pulse on demand.  </p>
<p>For accurate target shooting (especially in prone &#8212; that is, laying on one&#8217;s stomach) it&#8217;s essential to time your shot relative to your heartbeat.   If using a scope, you see see a regular one-to-two ring bounce, and you need to time your shot to go off between heartbeats while you are in the middle of the target. Here&#8217;s on article illustrating the phenomena: <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.scatt.com/article-pulse-technique" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.scatt.com/article-pulse-technique</a>.  Biathlon (which combines shooting and skiing) is a sport that particularly emphasizes this connection: <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.popsci.com/olympic-biathlon-shoot-between-heartbeats/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.popsci.com/olympic-biathlon-shoot-between-heartbeats/</a>.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think I can, but it would be a little difficult for me to actual measure my heart-rate that way.  I&#8217;ve also always had a terrible time trying to feel my pulse the old fashioned way.  And sometimes I can feel some sort of rhythmic tremor that I can mistake for my heart-rate except that it beats ~5 times faster, at a time when I am pretty sure my actual heart isn&#8217;t going that fast.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>There is such a thing as Christian rationalism. It has roots going back far further than secular rationalism since there&#8217;s a long standing tension in Abrahamic religions between what can be roughly termed mysticism and rationalism. It&#8217;s less prominent these days because the main religious divide in the Christian community isn&#8217;t along these lines but instead is defined by the 20th century fundamentalist-modernist split. Baptists tend to be more mystical and Catholics more rational but they&#8217;re both fundamentalists (in the fundamentalist-modernist sense). Episcopalalians are rationalist but modernist while Quakers are mystical but modernist. (As with all things, they have their heretics that are on the other side of each divide.)</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s largely not been welcomed by the rationalist community, which is a theologically a child of the modernist side of that debate and tends to enforce a rather atheist worldview.</p>

What do you mean by that? Google can give you lots of Catholic mystics describing weird visions and doing weird stuff. Catholics regularly do that transsubstantiation thing which is as mystical as it can get. Baptists don&#8217;t seem to have anything like that.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Tend to being the key word. A good hint is whether they emphasize the presence of the holy spirit/inner light/etc or have a highly developed theology that&#8217;s pretty strictly seen as important. My point is not that Catholics don&#8217;t believe in visions or the holy spirit, it&#8217;s that the religion tends to be opposed to things like quietism which focus more on things like FLWAB describes. It doesn&#8217;t mean they don&#8217;t have people focused on that or that it&#8217;s fully compatible with secular rationalism.</p>

<p>I see. Could you still explain the contradiction? I still don&#8217;t see it inherently, though I&#8217;m familiar with how in practice there&#8217;s a lot of atheism in the community.</p>

<p>Yes. If you want to smuggle an assumption in, one that we do not agree on, then you need to defend it. Of course, you&#8217;re free not to if you find it tiring. (That&#8217;s not sarcasm, you get to choose whether to engage or not.)</p>

<p>Does rationalism necessitate empiricism? As in, we can only know something is true based on whether we can directly sense it (see it, touch it, weigh it, etc)? Or do you mean something else?</p>

<p>Because it&#8217;s obviously still bread, and twisting Aristotle into knots in order to justify claiming a miracle is happening is more than I can stomach.   I could believe that god sent his son to earth, he died, and rose again after 3 days, I wasn&#8217;t there.

<blockquote><p>5 Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst. 36 But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe. 37 All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out. 38 For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me. 39 And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up on the last day. 40 For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.”</p>
<p>41 So the Jews grumbled about him, because he said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven.” 42 They said, “Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?” 43 Jesus answered them, “Do not grumble among yourselves. 44 No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day. 45 It is written in the Prophets, ‘And they will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me— 46 not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God; he has seen the Father. 47 Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life. 48 I am the bread of life. 49 Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. 50 This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die. 51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”</p>
<p>52 The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?” 53 So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. 54 Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. 55 For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. 56 Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him. 57 As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever feeds on me, he also will live because of me. 58 This is the bread that came down from heaven, not like the bread the fathers ate, and died. Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.” 59 Jesus said these things in the synagogue, as he taught at Capernaum.</p>
<p>60 When many of his disciples heard it, they said, “This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?” 61 But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were grumbling about this, said to them, “Do you take offense at this? 62 Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? 63 It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is no help at all. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. 64 But there are some of you who do not believe.” (For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him.) 65 And he said, “This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.”</p>
<p>66 After this many of his disciples turned back and no longer walked with him. </p></blockquote>
<p><i>Because it’s obviously still bread, and twisting Aristotle into knots in order to justify claiming a miracle is happening is more than I can stomach. </i></p>
<p>&#8220;Twisting Aristotle&#8221; is a way to satisfy the intellectual demand as to &#8220;how can this be?&#8221; but the ultimate answer is that this is a <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm" rel="nofollow ugc">mystery</a>.  Now, many people get really irritated by that, as they consider it a dodge and a fudge: &#8216;oh you&#8217;re trying to excuse your crazy beliefs by saying they are above human understanding!&#8217; and then those people run back to science, but in the end, when it comes to the supernatural there are going to be things you just have to suck it up and accept.  For myself, if I accept the existence of a personal God who created the entire universe <i>ex nihilo</i>, the rest of it comes easily.  To balk at that would indeed be to strain a gnat and swallow a camel.</p>
<p>People who can&#8217;t take that and leave it, it is no disgrace to them if they are honest.  Besides, during the Reformation, Protestants were very rude indeed about the Roman Catholic view of the Eucharist (Cranmer wrote of &#8220;worshipping a god made of bread&#8221; and developed his own <a rel="nofollow"href="http://www.affinity.org.uk/foundations-issues/issue-68-article-3---the-lord-s-supper-in-england-then-and-now---a-look-at-how-thomas-cranmer-s-euch" rel="nofollow ugc">understanding</a> of the sacrament) and yet they would have claimed they were fully accepting the mysterious and supernatural in Christianity 🙂</p>

<p>As a Christian myself, I second Erusian&#8217;s question:  why would they need to be reconciled?  In past discussions with atheists, I&#8217;ve seen the questions largely come down either to different premises (a Bayesian would say different prior probabilities), different conceptions of evidence (e.g. historical events can&#8217;t be put through scientific studies), or arguments about specific doctrines and their alleged observable consequences (where, often, we have different interpretations of the doctrines.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I was getting all fired up to post a comment somewhere else and skimmed <a rel="nofollow"href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/" rel="nofollow ugc">this</a> re: rationalism vs. empiricism.</p>
<p>So based on that extensive knowledge base, I&#8217;ll try to gesture at a response.</p>
<p>The rational can accommodate the supernatural to the extent that you grant supernatural claims as a premise.</p>
<p>To me that might seem like begging the question in the worst way, but I can at least understand why others disagree.</p>
<p>Consider the claims:<br />
&#8211; The measles vaccine is 95% effective at preventing measles<br />
&#8211; Suffering is bad<br />
&#8211; God exists</p>
<p>It&#8217;s rational to generally grant the first claim because we have reams of empirical data and experience to support it, and a justified (though imperfect) set of rules for evaluating claims based on that data.</p>
<p>And while it seems safe to say that nearly all rationalists grant the second claim, it&#8217;s not at all clear that it rests on any firmer foundation than the third.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t require the rationalist who earns-to-give to reconcile their rationalism with their belief that suffering is bad. We grant their premise that suffering is bad and applaud them for living so consistently with their values.</p>
<p>Do we have any grounds to claim that the missionary is objectively less rational?</p>
<p>Does anyone know of a reason we should privilege the premise &#8220;suffering is bad&#8221; over the premise &#8220;God exists?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God exists&#8221; doesn&#8217;t necessarily raise people from the dead either. Any Catholic philosopher will give you a long essay on the logical ground to be covered between &#8220;God exists&#8221; and inferences about a particular historical human being the Incarnation, the value of verbal factual claims depending on the nature of the speaker, and Jesus raising other people from the dead.</p>
<p>In the Western tradition, &#8220;God&#8221; in a philosophy context is commonly defined as &#8220;the Good&#8221;. &#8220;The Good exists&#8221; has something of the nature of a normative claim. Any normative claim like &#8220;Suffering is bad&#8221; raises ontological questions: &#8220;What is bad? What is good?&#8221; For Western philosophers, &#8220;God exists&#8221; answers the latter question with &#8220;Good is objective and potent.&#8221;<br />
Now what&#8217;s Bad and why is suffering in the set of bad things?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>“God exists” doesn’t necessarily raise people from the dead either. Any Catholic philosopher will give you a long essay on the logical ground to be covered between “God exists” and inferences about a particular historical human being the Incarnation, the value of verbal factual claims depending on the nature of the speaker, and Jesus raising other people from the dead.</p>
<p>In the Western tradition, “God” in a philosophy context is commonly defined as “the Good”. “The Good exists” has something of the nature of a normative claim.</p></blockquote>
<p>I understand this, but Catholicism does not end with &#8220;God&#8221; is &#8220;the Good&#8221; and neither do most sects.  If you believed literally nothing else than that &#8220;good exists&#8221; when you say &#8220;god exists&#8221;, that might be a normative claim. But that wouldn&#8217;t be Christianity without a lot of other things added in. And in the context of a missionary (which is the original hypothetical), that makes no sense.</p>
<p>Who is our hypothetical missionary? A <strike>heretic </strike>Jesuit?</p>
<blockquote><p>For Western philosophers, “God exists” answers the latter question with “Good is objective and potent.”</p></blockquote>
<p>For certain Western philosophers.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Count me as another person who doesn’t understand how the rational can accommodate the supernatural.</p></blockquote>
<p>We are pretty confident of some facts from Quantum Mechanics and Relativity that feel supernatural — inconsistent with strongly held beliefs about what the world is like. Quantum mechanical tunneling or an electron going through both slits and interfering with itself, or velocities not adding, would be examples. Are religious claims that you label &#8220;supernatural&#8221; more obviously false, or is it just that we don&#8217;t have as good evidence for them?</p>

The difference between the second and third claims is that &#8220;God exists&#8221; is a statement about the territory. &#8220;Suffering is bad&#8221;, like any other use of &#8220;good&#8221; or &#8220;bad&#8221;, is a value judgment &#8211; ultimately, an opinion. To the extent that it makes any claims about the territory, it is because it is implicitly using the speaker&#8217;s personal utility function as a referent (i.e. it&#8217;s a statement about <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eDpPnT7wdBwWPGvo5/2-place-and-1-place-words" rel="nofollow ugc">Apogee::badness</a> as opposed to badness). I don&#8217;t want to put words in anyone else&#8217;s mouth, but I suspect that any temptation a rationalist feels to treat &#8220;suffering is bad&#8221; as an objective claim comes more from an extant belief that most other humans agree with them than it does from some greater universal truth.</p>

I wouldn&#8217;t classify QM as &#8220;supernatural&#8221; based solely on it feeling counter-intuitive. In fact, I would claim the opposite: most things in the &#8220;supernatural&#8221; bucket (e.g. <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/f4txACqDWithRi7hs/occam-s-razor" rel="nofollow ugc">Thor and witches</a>) stick in human consciousness precisely because they are more intuitive than reality. To me, QM feeling as weird as it does only further drives home the point that it is natural &#8211; would we have ever come up with the associated equations and theories, without empirical observations to guide us there?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Can&#8217;t speak for them, but I can try to steelman.</p>
<p>I gather a religious person feels the presence of God as unambiguously as I feel the presence of my Self, or my Free Will. (And might be just as curious/uncertain whether that is a real thing or an epiphenomenon of how evolution has constructed us, but in the end is just not capable of acting as if that feeling is false.) Granting that axiom, there is plenty of room to use the tools of rationalism, both for unrelated questions and to explore what follows from that axiom.</p>

<p>Speaking as a religious person, I don&#8217;t. I have felt what I might consider to possibly be the presence of God on five occasions in my life, but never with anything near the certainty of the presence of my Self or Will.</p>

<p>&#8230; and if you&#8217;re Hindu, you&#8217;re supposed to feel the presence of your Self as unambiguously as the presence of your Self!<br />
(There&#8217;s more to it than that, but &#8220;Self&#8221; is the standard English translation of &#8220;Atman&#8221;, the real you in contrast to the &#8220;self&#8221;/ego. The obvious meaning of the Upanishads is that Atman = Brahman, with &#8220;Brahman&#8221; meaning &#8220;God, maybe or maybe not a person&#8221;. Despite accepting the Upanishads being a non-negotiable point of Hinduism, there are versions of it that are monotheist in the Western sense and versions that are atheist.)</p>

<p>Some may do, I&#8217;m not going to get into the weeds of theology and Protestantism 🙂</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t feel that presence myself, but on the other hand, when I have tried not believing in God (and I have done, for the sake of the experiment to be fair about &#8220;do I just believe this because this is how I was raised?&#8221;), it just does not make sense to me, I can&#8217;t make it fit,  I come back to &#8220;No, God exists&#8221;.</p>
<p>As mentioned in other comments, that is only the beginning of the whole question then 🙂</p>

I assume you do mean rationalist as in &#8220;Bay Area Rationalist&#8221; and not the older philosophical school; BAR is pretty Christian-hostile outside of Scott&#8217;s strange accumulation of Christian and often traditionalist fans.

<p>The first thing I ever encountered by him was the post (essay?) with the line &#8220;Even Origen would say you&#8217;re going to Hell&#8221;. Having even that much knowledge of ancient Christianity made him the only Less Wronger who seemed interesting. His LW screen name being a Knight of the Round Table did not help clear up the matter of atheism.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s because he doesn&#8217;t. Scott doesn&#8217;t casually drop anti-religious signals into his writing, so it doesn&#8217;t drive the religious away. It really is that easy, but people can&#8217;t resist flashing their badge most of the time.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Historically, Scott also engaged with bloggers like Leah Libresco and by extension writers like Ed Feser or Alasdair MacIntyre. Leah was how I learned about his Livejournal (though I lurked on LessWrong and had probably already seen posts by Yvain at the time). Some of Scott&#8217;s harder to shake off religious readers date from that era.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>This whole thread is fascinating to me, because as a relatively recent lurker and even more recent poster, I&#8217;ve been too embarrassed to start a thread about why what I thought was a rationalist-adjacent blog has so many religiously-motivated discussions.

<p>Because he&#8217;s genuinely tolerant.  He never made and does not make a big deal out of &#8220;Smart People Only welcome here, that means you smelly religionists Stay Out&#8221; and he doesn&#8217;t interfere when some of us start discussing things like the Eucharist, Universalism, baptism and engaging in Biblical exegesis.</p>
<p>That is <b>remarkably</b> even-handed and I&#8217;d be hard-pushed to find a corresponding religion blogger that extended so much leeway to non-believers having a rousing discussion about statistics down in a comment thread 🙂</p>

<p>To be fair to rationalists, they&#8217;re not the only ones who do this (I&#8217;ve had some fruitless arguments online trying to tell people who are not Catholics what it is that I, a Catholic, believe and getting back &#8220;no you don&#8217;t believe that, this is what you believe&#8221; with their weird mangling of doctrines).  There&#8217;s someone over on the sub-reddit at TheMotte who talked about &#8220;the communion of saints&#8221; and well, let me just say they&#8217;re not getting it right.</p>
<p>The rationalist/atheist shared space can be pretty bad about this, though.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Now, now, Nick *wags finger in your direction*</p>
<p>Mistaken comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Roman Catholic Church has a peculiar belief called the communion of saints. The basic idea seems to be that saints who score above 100% on the entrance exam to Heaven are able to transfer extra credits to other people in order to get more people into Heaven. This doctrine doesn&#8217;t get talked about much, though, especially not in the way I am describing it.</p></blockquote>
<p>My long-winded explanation (I can&#8217;t post this over on TheMotte because I&#8217;m permabanned):</p>
<p>There seems to be a conflation of two ideas here: the Communion of Saints and the Treasury of Merits. Also, please scrap the notion of &#8220;scor(ing) above 100% on the entrance exam to Heaven&#8221;, Dante writing his epic poem at the tail end of the 13th century/beginning of the 14th century could correctly state that there is no difference in the bliss of Heaven enjoyed by the saved, no matter if they were a great saint or just scraped in. In the 21st century with easy access to sources online, there&#8217;s no excuse for this kind of ignorance.</p>
<p>Communion of Saints &#8211; develops on from the idea of the Mystical Body of Christ, namely, all the baptised and members of the Church are the Body of Christ. <i>Pace</i> Wikipedia, which has a good if brief definition:</p>
<blockquote><p>The communion of saints (<i>communio sanctorum</i>), when referred to persons, is the spiritual union of the members of the Christian Church, living and the dead, excluding therefore the damned. They are all part of a single &#8220;mystical body&#8221;, with Christ as the head, in which each member contributes to the good of all and shares in the welfare of all.</p></blockquote>
<p>Therefore you and I, if we are baptised Christians, are part of the Communion of Saints while alive together with the souls in Purgatory (if you&#8217;re Catholic) and the blessed in Heaven. It&#8217;s got nothing to do with extra marks on the entrance exam, it&#8217;s more like &#8220;You, me, José, Arjun and George Washington are all American citizens&#8221;.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury_of_merit" rel="nofollow ugc">The Treasury of Merits</a> is reliant upon the saving merits of Christ won by His sacrificial death on the cross. We by our good deeds can add to it, but that&#8217;s like pouring a cup of water into the ocean. Human merit has little to do with it <b>except insofar as it is all part of the idea of the faithful as a family, linked together by our baptism, and the love we should have for one another</b>. By analogy, suppose you need help paying the rent this month for one reason or another, you might ask your rich brother Joe to help you because he has the cash to spare and he&#8217;s your brother. Family members help one another. The saints love us and want to help us because we&#8217;re all one family (see Communion of Saints above). Thus, since complete conformity to the will of God and saving faith enable us to perform miracles (look up the Gospels for yourselves on this one) they act as agents of God to help us when we ask through intercessionary prayer for aid, <b>but this is all based on the power of God, not human power alone.</b></p>
<p>Mainly, I was irked by that part of their larger comment because somebody who has no idea what Catholic beliefs are is going to read that, then go off with a false idea in their head about &#8220;Catholics think that you can socre higher than 100% on the exam to get into Heaven&#8221; 😠</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I want to keep this broad because I know the odds of finding anything is low from the start. Yeah, by rationalism I mean Bay Area or LW rationalism, not the philosophical school where the mind is the basis of human knowledge and constitution. Some traits could be: 1. Has read the Sequences, 2. Frequently comments or posts in rationalist spaces, 3. Interest in cognitive biases and avoiding them, not just object-level research, 4. Grey tribe would be an okay but low-resolution proxy, 5. Interest in memetics.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>This probably isn&#8217;t exactly what you&#8217;re looking for, but Bob Murphy is an Austrian Economist and Libertarian political theorist who is also very explicitly Christian.  His podcast intro describes him as &#8220;A Christian and Economist.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s not explicitly rationalist, but might count as &#8220;adjacent&#8221; in the sense that I know him to be a regular reader of SSC and generally approving of it.</p>
<p>Look for &#8220;The Bob Murphy Show&#8221; in your favorite podcast app and give a few episodes a try?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I haven&#8217;t looked at his stuff for a while, but I took a look years ago and concluded that his material doesn&#8217;t have too much to offer unless you&#8217;re really devoted to the Austrian/libertarian angle, as he is. I&#8217;m not &#8212; I was just looking for intelligent Christian writers.</p>
<p>Funny enough, I didn&#8217;t realize until thinking about it that I actually met him in real life and chatted for a bit at one point, without knowing who he was. I think he must have been pretty fresh out of grad school at the time. Seemed like a nice and personable enough fellow.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>i am christian and aspiring-rationalist and i&#8217;d also be interested in a blog/podcast on the subject. while my christian beliefs are very nontraditional, and probably more in line with unitarian universalist beliefs than the average* views of the methodist and UCC churches I attend. however, as far as I&#8217;m aware there are not many views I don&#8217;t share with the minister of the methodist church; as such, i don&#8217;t find a contradiction between my views and labelling them as Christian if they are shared, even only 90%, which someone who went to seminary and is about to retire after 39 of ministry. i&#8217;m open to more questions about this if people are curious.<br />
*while the minister and I almost always see theologically eye-to-eye, the same cannot be said of me and the other churchgoers.<br />
i have a rat-adj tumblr tamartia.tumblr.com tho i don&#8217;t post a ton of religious stuff. but if you want to DM me that&#8217;s a good place to go.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My Hanging With History podcast certainly is rationalist-adjacent and Christian-adjacent, although it is not specifically about either of those things.  SSC gets mentioned quite a bit.  </p>
<p>The Magna Carta episode (episode 11) coming out this weekend has a long tribute to the It Was You Who Made By Brown Eyes Blue essay.</p>
<p>But it is not specifically about cognitive biases or Christianity, or reconciling them, if that&#8217;s what you are trying to find.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>On a whim, I reinstalled Knights of the Old Republic last night and was struck by how poorly it has aged. The game came at a transition point for Bioware, between its early systems-heavy RPGs and later &#8220;cinematic experiences&#8221;. At first glance, KotOR seems to share the downsides of both. Like Baldur&#8217;s Gate, there&#8217;s a lot of low-risk combat and endless collecting of vendor trash. Like the Mass Effects, you&#8217;re pretty limited in what you can do, and the combat is never all that interesting/challenging. Baldur&#8217;s Gate at least committed to the party-based experience and had reasonably-fun tactical gameplay. The Mass Effects have better conversations and framing and are more willing to let companions break the rules.</p>
<p>When it came out KotOR was a huge critical and audience darling. So am I being unfair to an old classic, or has it really just been superseded?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Certain elements have definitely aged poorly, but I wouldn&#8217;t say that vendor trash collection is fully superceded in modern game design. Modern loot shooters like Borderlands or Destiny rely on the constant generation of sub-par equipment as a component of the game&#8217;s economy.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It wasn&#8217;t my intention to suggest that modern gaming has ditched vendor trash, only that later Bioware games mostly did. I haven&#8217;t played Inquisition or Andromeda, much less Anthem, so this might just be an overly specific generalization.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I had a similar experience replaying the game recently, but I think you&#8217;re missing part of KoTOR&#8217;s initial appeal: the story. The story was amazing, or at least I thought so as a kid. While it&#8217;s easy to compare gameplay across time, it&#8217;s harder to do so for stories, because you only experience the story for the first time once. Now that you know how it all turns out, it&#8217;s less interesting. Since that was a driving part of my interest in the game, replaying the game in 2020 just simply cannot be as much &#8211; there is no surprise or mystery anymore.</p>
<p>That is, I think your issue with KotOR might be replayability, rather than playability per se,</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>As a counterpoint, good story-heavy games can reward replay by letting you see alternative sides of the story. That was a major selling point of KotOR, with its light and dark side paths. KotOR does have a super infamous twist, so maybe that was a bigger driving point behind its acclaim than I realized.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Agreed.  And let&#8217;s keep the context in mind here.  In the years before KOTOR, cinematic-style story-heavy western games really didn&#8217;t exist.  If you wanted heavy story in your video games, you had to play a JRPG, which were sort of culturally distinct and had all kinds of eccentricities of their own.</p>
<p>KOTOR is sort of a stepping off point.  You don&#8217;t get from Final Fantasy and Baldur&#8217;s Gate to Mass Effect without something like it in the middle, serving as the bridge.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The reason I love KotOR is because it&#8217;s one of the few works of Star Wars fiction (outside of the original trilogy) that actually <i>feels</i> like real Star Wars.</p>
<p>When I think of Star Wars, I think of the original trilogy, the Thrawn trilogy, and KotOR.</p>
<p>I still remember playing it, and being elated because the thrill that was Star Wars &#8211; that I thought the prequels and adulthood had managed to kill completely &#8211; was still there after all.</p>
<p>The combat gameplay hasn&#8217;t aged particularly well (and even at the time, it wasn&#8217;t really anything extraordinary), but the story really drew me in. </p>
<p>And as far as other Bioware games go, I think in many ways it represented a high point in their ability to deliver character-driven roleplaying. Their later efforts (despite moments of brilliance like ME2) got far more formulaic, and even at their best tended to have this really awkward division between combat and everything else. You&#8217;d either be in the dating simulator / exploration mode, or killing waves of enemies with minimal interaction with the world or other characters.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I both read Thrawn and played KotoR for the first time within the last year (so no nostalgia). I did it to rinse the bad taste of Rise of Skywalker out of my mouth. The Thrawn trilogy has some glaring plot holes (Vader&#8217;s age is all messed up, and as a result the twist in the second book doesn&#8217;t make sense), but it and Kotor felt like Star Wars. They are miles better than the prequels or sequels. What were Disney and George Lucas thinking?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I read the first half of the first new Thrawn novel. I didn&#8217;t like it. Boring perfect Thrawn smugly outwits everyone, but it doesn&#8217;t really feel clever because he&#8217;s using information the reader doesn&#8217;t have. He&#8217;s much better as an antagonist in the tv show.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t read the old novels, and I&#8217;m not really familiar with the old EU in general.</p>

<p>To be fair, he has the same problem (he&#8217;s a genius, but the writer isn&#8217;t so there is no way for him to &#8220;show his work&#8221; to the reader &#8211; it&#8217;s an issue as old as Sherlock Holmes) in the original novels as well, but he is the antagonist there.</p>
<p>Of course, Luke, Leia and Han (with some assists from Lando and a few new character that fit in well) somehow always manage to at least partially foil his plans.  And Zahn is good at making it feel like they really are the same characters you know and love. (Some of the characterization &#8220;tricks&#8221; he employs aren&#8217;t especially subtle, but they work. Far better than anything in the sequels&#8230;)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@ Bullseye,<br />
I agree; though I enjoyed the books, as I said, the biggest downside to me compared to the original Thrawn trilogy was the switch from Thrawn as villain who needs to be outwitted (challenging and difficult for our plucky protagonists!) to the hero, who continuously outwits all his foes (no challenge whatsoever). It sounds like I might enjoy Rebels, though.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Remember that the Thrawn books predate the original trilogy, so Vader&#8217;s age isn&#8217;t that off. I always assumed Vader had Luke and Leia late in life, and the reason he looked so damn old was because he WAS fairly old. I mean, the actor in Jedi was 78.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Oddly enough I just sort of realized the ages of the characters in Star Wars almost make sense, while trying to demonstrate the opposite:</p>
<p>When filming Revenge of the Sith, Ewan McGregor would have been about 33 or so. A New Hope takes place when Luke and Leia are 19, so Obi-Wan Kenobi should have looked about like 52-year-old Ewan McGregor. Now I always thought Alec Guinness looked way older than that, but at the time of filming ANH, Guinness was 63. A pretty rough looking 63 I think, but whatever. I guess I can believe spending 19 years as a desert hermit can age you an extra 11 years. So, not perfect, but not as bad as I thought.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I always thought Leia looked older than Luke, to the point I thought it was a plot hole that they turn out to be twins. But I looked it up just now and Hamill was six years older than Fisher! Looking back, Hamill did a really good job at acting like a teenager, and Leia seems older than she is because of her self-confidence.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ll agree that as far as gameplay goes, KOTOR doesn&#8217;t have a lot of depth. It&#8217;s a pretty standard d20 system, so if you know how to min-max that, you can blow through even the hardest fights. When you&#8217;re badly optimized difficulty doesn&#8217;t really kick in until you&#8217;re off Taris (The second Calo Nord fight was a notorious newb check). When I played it when I was young, it was still plenty invigorating to me even if I could roll over most of the trash mobs, because of the narrative. Straightforward and easy fights aren&#8217;t really a problem if you buy into the context. I like some very mechanically intensive games, but in a certain frame of mind it&#8217;s nice to play something simpler and just enjoy the story. I revisited the game as an adult and still had a good time, the writing held up.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really more of a KotOR II guy myself. I think the dialogue and writing in that game can stand up to anything else, and there&#8217;s a bit more room and demand for min-maxing. I&#8217;ve replayed the sequel maybe five times, it&#8217;s one that I keep returning to every once in a while. Just make sure to use the Restored Content mod!</p>

<p>Can you recommend a generic strategy guide for min-maxing d20? I’ve been thinking about a Kotor replay but for the story, not to get bogged down in combat.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I can&#8217;t recommend any generic d20 guides  because the  details in the system matter a lot, but , or specific KOTOR guides because I haven&#8217;t played it in 5 years or so.</p>
<p>but a few general rules of thumb for min-maxing D20 systems include:<br />
Build a character that is only dependent on one ability score &#8211; Ability points are a very limited commodity<br />
Build a combat character &#8211; Thieves or diplomats are cool, but poor games create EXP walls in combat situations, not social or stealth situations.<br />
Understand Kiting and if its feasible &#8211; Ranged characters often use a strategy called &#8220;Kiting&#8221; where they attack while staying out of melee range of their enemies. Its a really effective strategy, but sometimes Game designers inflict big penalties to ranged users to compensate.<br />
Focus on being able to do a lot of damage to one person, not a little damage to a lot of people &#8211; people die fighting sith, not stormtroopers<br />
Your Main Character should always get the best gear for combat.<br />
Make sure your character can survive on their own &#8211; games where you build a party often end up separating you from your party in the third act. If you want to &#8216;cheat&#8217; by researching in advance, your strategy might change.<br />
Don&#8217;t make a Glass Cannon &#8211; Glass Cannons are good if your hero can be protected, but its hard to survive on your own<br />
Wizards are Glass Cannons &#8211; They can get really powerful, but they don&#8217;t have the endurance to survive without their party.<br />
Make sure Your Protagonist can heal ( a little) &#8211; a little bit of healing goes a long way for survive-ability. </p>
<p>Also, Specific to KOTOR:<br />
 Blasters are a trap. Do not use them. ever.<br />
 You absolutely need a ranged attack for your main character. If you don&#8217;t get one you can&#8217;t finish the game.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m surprised you didn&#8217;t find the combat challenging. I picked it up a few years ago and didn&#8217;t finish because it was too hard.</p>
<p>I got to the part where you can choose which planet you go to. I was surprised that, with the game system based on leveling up, there was no indication of which planet was appropriate for my level. I guess I picked the wrong one, because I banged my head on an unwinnable fight. I could have gone back and tried one of the other planets, but then I would have lost the thread of the storyline of the one I was on and I wasn&#8217;t enjoying the game enough for it to be worth it.</p>
<p>If it matters, I was playing a melee fighter because I suspected I was going to turn out to be a Jedi.</p>
<p>Also the graphics were sometimes pretty janky sometimes. I think it was because I was running it on a much newer machine than it was meant for.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve really enjoyed the MMO.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think the game used level scaling to keep the challenge (roughly) appropriate. I think any planet should be acceptable. It might be worth revisiting sometime in the future. I do think newer graphics cards have trouble displaying some effects, especially AMD cards.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>First post.</p>
<p>I will be doing an online SSC meetup on Mozilla Hubs again this Saturday, starting at 1P.M. Pacific time. Everyone welcome — last Saturday we had people from Czechia, Scandinavia, California, &#8230;  . I&#8217;m hoping to make this into a regular event. No special topic, no talk, just conversation.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>This is the <a rel="nofollow"href="http://www.daviddfriedman.com/SSC%20Meetups%20announcement.html" rel="nofollow ugc">web page</a> where I announce the meetups. It currently has the date for the first one, but I plan to do them every Saturday until further notice. People are also welcome to come on Sunday at 1:00 if they like to talk to each other, but I don&#8217;t guarantee that I will be there — one meetup a week is all I feel like actively hosting.</p>
<p>To learn about Mozilla Hubs, click on the link on the page labelled &#8220;Mozilla Hubs.&#8221; To go to the meetup, click on the link labelled &#8220;meetup site.&#8221; All it takes is a browser, although if you happen to have an Oculus Quest or the equivalent, you can go the same site in VR instead of on a screen.</p>
<p>For some reason, my attempts to put the link to the site in posts here sometimes doesn&#8217;t work, so I&#8217;m using a link to my page instead.</p>
