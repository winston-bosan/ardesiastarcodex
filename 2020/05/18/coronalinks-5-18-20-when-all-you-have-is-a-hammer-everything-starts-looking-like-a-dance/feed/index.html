@Edward Scizorhands,

Sorry I meant to include this one:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://judithcurry.com/2020/05/10/why-herd-immunity-to-covid-19-is-reached-much-earlier-than-thought/#more-26133&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;why-herd-immunity-to-covid-19-is-reached-much-earlier-than-thought&lt;/a&gt;

I&#039;m not really technically savvy enough to evaluate how well their model works in that paper, but they seem to be covering all their bases. They find that with the non-homogeneity seen elsewhere in covid-19 that herd immunity could occur around 7%-24%.

It doesn&#039;t say anything about the seroprevalence in Sweden. My own extrapolation from the 5% studies, I haven&#039;t seen anywhere else.]]></description>

I&#039;ve become significantly less convinced of their numbers for Rt. As new data comes in, they revise their past estimates. These revisions are sometimes noticeably larger than the error bars shown.

Their estimate for Texas now has a Rt &#062; 1 through the beginning of May.]]></description>

I am very late but a number of churches are responding to this. 

1) Those with large choirs are suspending or spreading them.

2) Those with small choirs are asking the congregation not to sing; let the choir do it. The choir is helping by not telling parishioners what book/page they are singing from and doing obscure things so the congregation can&#039;t just sing along.

I have a scattering of google links and personal anecdotes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Per-capita infections and deaths are only useful to form priors about how likely you are to be infected or dead. Until the number of people already infected is a substantial factor in how many more people are infected, a smaller population provides no substantial protection from further spread- when growth shifts to resemble the logistic curve exclusively, and no the exponential curve as well. 

Even worse, looking at &quot;the united states&quot; is more or less just looking at &quot;New York City&quot;, so the per-capita denominator is simply as wrong as if &quot;EU countries&quot; or any other stupid aggregation was used. Frankly, aggregating all of New York City should be barely acceptable in considering global data; state and province-level aggregation should be the greatest done anywhere, and most metropolitan areas should be aggregated individually.]]></description>

I&#039;m claiming the politicians will allow them open earlier then scientists prefer for political reasons, not out of an abundance of moral courage on their part. You are certainly welcome to attribute this poorly worded cynicism on my part to whatever moral failing you&#039;d prefer.]]></description>

I didn&#039;t find &quot;antibod&quot; or &quot;sweden&quot; or &quot;stockholm&quot; in that article. Wrong link?

I&#039;ve posted links over the past few months suggesting both significant (plus 30% a few weeks ago) and small (5%) numbers for antibody tests in Sweden. I&#039;m not sure which is which, and while each study seems reasonable in isolation, I haven&#039;t seen a piece in the press try to explain which we should listen to.

And it matters a lot, because in one case the HI strategy has a reasonable chance of working, and in the other it&#039;s a failure.]]></description>

They&#039;re already falling apart though, which imo was kind of predictable.  There is only so long a democratic government can maintain a strict lockdown before political pressure forces it to open back up, and we&#039;re already getting there in some places.

If you assume that a 2-3 month strict lockdown followed by opening back up slowly is probably the limits of state capacity in most places, then it was probably correct to do it rather than to not do it, even if we never get a vaccine.  

I don&#039;t think remaining shut down for years was ever really on the table no matter if we wanted to or not.]]></description>
