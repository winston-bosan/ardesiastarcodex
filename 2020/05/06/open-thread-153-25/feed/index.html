@AG

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ain’t that why they’re your fargroup instead of the outgroup?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I think that you are intentionally addressing an argument I didn&#039;t make, to demonstrate that you disagree with it, which I consider an unpleasant tactic.

There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewforum.org/2018/06/13/young-adults-around-the-world-are-less-religious-by-several-measures/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;41 countries where Christianity is declining and 2 where it is rising&lt;/a&gt;, where the rest is stable or there is no data. In the data, you also see that young Christians are intensively religious than the older generations. Is your opposition to Christianity centered on Ghana or Chad? If not, the place where Christianity is increasing is no less your fargroup than it is mine.

Again, my argument is that Christianity has largely been reined in* and made peace with important limitations to its power, but that this is not true for SJ. This is not an argument about how much damage each ideology is already doing, which is another discussion (and you seem to be unwilling to credit Christianity for anything, so I doubt I can discuss this productively with you).

Following your logic, as the British empire had done more harm up to 1939 than the National-socialists, one should back the latter over the former, at that point in time.

* This is not the same as neutered.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I’ve seen far more cases of SJ being applied moderately, with concrete benefits (that would not have been realized otherwise), than I’ve seen of out of control abuse&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You&#039;d probably have seen the same thing if you were part of a church. You seem to be identifying the outgroup with the worst that happens in that group (probably fed substantially by the outrage-media), while attributing the best to your own group.

&lt;blockquote&gt;One look at the actual founding texts of all of these common concepts would prove it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I did and that&#039;s actually why I concluded that the discriminatory bias goes to the roots and is present almost everywhere within the movement. When reading papers and (parts of) books by the most famous authors, I found an overwhelming amount of implicit and explicit stereotyping of people with one demographic trait as evil and universally privileged &#038; people with the opposite trait as innocent and universally unprivileged. There was almost exclusively only an interest in facts and perspectives that fit this black/white model, even to the point of suppressing unpleasant research outcomes.

I asked a bunch of SJ advocates for their best authors on gender relations and they came back time and again with ones that demonstrated immense bias, where the advocates appeared blind to it, which strengthened my impression that this bias was nigh-universal.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I can still personally apply those same ideals in my personal life in a charitable way&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You&#039;ve merely told me that your SJ friends run soup kitchens, which religious and otherwise non-SJ people do as well. So no need for the SJ ideology, to do that. What is the part that is actually sufficiently specific to SJ that makes you support it?

&lt;blockquote&gt;That doesn’t mean that all of its ideals should be consigned to the dustbin, just as previous ideologies that have since become warped and somewhat retired still have concepts that are part of the background noise now.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What parts should actually be preserved that are better than older forms of progressivism?

&lt;blockquote&gt;Shouldn’t you be pushing for SJ to go the way of defanged Christianity, instead of being so insistent that it’s permanent poison, that you induce evaporative cooling instead?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Your question doesn&#039;t make sense to me. A ton of people did argue that Christianity is permanent poison, yet it still got defanged. Perhaps that was actually necessary, for the defanging to occur. Or not. It&#039;s hardly exact science where criticizing an ideology like X while always result in Y, no matter the ideology, the people involved, the circumstances, etc.

Also, it&#039;s hardly clear that an increase in extremism only happens through evaporative cooling.

&lt;blockquote&gt;You support the spirit of the men’s rights movement, despite all of the warping of its ideals by sociopaths&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is actually remarkably little warping. Pretty much all of the (hit)pieces in the mainstream media about it are outgroup homogeneity fallacies that equate the movement with people or groups that have no connection to the men&#039;s rights movement or even explicitly denounce it. I just looked at the current Reddit page for /r/MensRights and I would call none of the posts sociopathic.

Note that it is hard for non-marginalized people to support the movement because of how the movement clashes with both the mainstream and gender roles, so going public is both career-suicide for anyone who wants to work within the mainstream and lowers your social status.]]></description>

Oh sure, I&#039;ll concede that reality is asymmetric, since Christianity&#039;s influence, and the effect of abusive Christianity, is certainly far more widespread in the world right now than SJ. Ain&#039;t that why they&#039;re your fargroup instead of the outgroup?

Our perspectives simply are too different. I&#039;ve seen far more cases of SJ being applied moderately, with concrete benefits (that would not have been realized otherwise), than I&#039;ve seen of out of control abuse, which seems confined to areas which would have been high-drama, regardless of which ideology they picked to further their agenda. To me, the tradeoff is currently worth it, and serves as a counterexample to you claim that SJ is fundamentally about discrimination. One look at the actual founding texts of all of these common concepts would prove it.

No matter how much you try to tell me how other people have warped SJ ideals, I can still personally apply those same ideals in my personal life in a charitable way, and no amount of pooh-poohing can stop me. 

As per my other comment, your interjections simply don&#039;t seem to be offering anything to the conversation. What even is the consequence you are going for here? If the people in here explaining the motte versions of SJ ideals all concede your points (in fact, most of us have literally already acknowledged them), so what? What does that do for you or us? It&#039;s a conclusion with no impact.

I can even concede that SJ has perhaps run its course, and should be replaced with something else with the decade. That doesn&#039;t mean that all of its ideals should be consigned to the dustbin, just as previous ideologies that have since become warped and somewhat retired still have concepts that are part of the background noise now. Shouldn&#039;t you be pushing for SJ to go the way of defanged Christianity, instead of being so insistent that it&#039;s permanent poison, that you induce evaporative cooling instead?
You support the spirit of the men&#039;s rights movement, despite all of the warping of its ideals by sociopaths (and I agree with you on a lot of those points). Excuse me for doing the same with SJ.]]></description>

And we&#039;re back to the fact that this is the result of geeks-mops-sociopaths playing out in SJ as it does in any ideology. 

The reason I&#039;ve been emphasizing the motte in these threads is that Nancy Lebovitz&#039;s OP was all about asking what the motte was in various outgroup ideologies was.

@AG

&lt;blockquote&gt;I’m pushing the line on whether or not SJ is uniquely bad, because you seem to be uniquely opposing it&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I doubt that whatever behavior you define as &#039;uniquely opposing it,&#039; actually requires SJ to be uniquely bad. Singling out something certainly doesn&#039;t require you to think that it is uniquely bad. If Russian tanks were actually advancing on my country, I would oppose it more strongly than the purely abstract idea of having German tanks advance on my country, but that&#039;s not because I consider the former to be uniquely bad compared to a German advance, but merely because it is currently salient and currently poses a far greater risk to various things I care about.

It&#039;s also possible to simply have a specialization, a personal reason, a special interest, etc.

&lt;blockquote&gt;while any alternatives you seem to support have the same failure modes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I think that SJ can only fail and is way more likely to fail in far worse ways.

&lt;blockquote&gt;whereas you seem to only see the baileys run amuck.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No, I see the extremists winning time and again. Discriminating people purely because of their gender has suddenly become acceptable to the elite in my country. Another win for the extremists, while the left-wing moderates are not opposing it at all (or at least, not in any way visible to me). 

&lt;blockquote&gt;But if SJ’s failings are that the baileys enable abuse&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No, it&#039;s main failing is that it is built on a conspiracy theory that dehumanizes the other and makes people interpret the very same evidence differently based on the identities of those involved. Discrimination is at the core of the ideology, not merely something that emerges when people abuse the ideology for selfish ends.

&lt;blockquote&gt;We could re-post all of these points about the things SJ does wrong, replaced with Christianity, but I don’t see you hopping into every thread about that to pooh-pooh the Christians on the board about how their religion keeps getting warped into abusing people. Your objections appear asymmetrically.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewforum.org/2019/10/17/in-u-s-decline-of-christianity-continues-at-rapid-pace/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Reality is asymmetric&lt;/a&gt;. Also, while the Bible has some rather noxious elements, very many Christians have adopted interpretations that neutralized these bits. For example, did you fear that Obama would abuse people because of him being a Christian?

Also, Christians have mostly adopted some very important ground rules, including the freedom of religion which can be found in many constitutions. In contrast, SJ appears extremely prone to want to destroy important foundations to our societies whenever they can, like the principle of Rule of Law, non-discrimination, freedom of speech, etc.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Which works out on the ground, as I go to music ensemble rehearsals in a church with a prominent Social Justice section on their bulletin board, containing their volunteer sign-ups for their soup kitchen, and fly rainbow flags and hang “Immigrants welcome” banners out front.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Historically, it is quite common for supporters of all kinds of extremely horrible ideologies to run soup kitchens and such. This is perfectly logical, because major evil is usual done when bad ideology cause people to think that they can do good, by doing things that actually have very bad consequences. This not only can coexist with doing actually good things, but is actually a good thing in the view of the proponents, because their bad ideology makes them see it as a good thing.

This is only confusing to outsiders with a bad model of human behavior, who notice other people doing both things that they themselves see a good, but also things they see as bad &#038; don&#039;t understand how this can coexist in the same person.]]></description>

It is important to acknowledge when an ideology has failed in a way common to other ideologies, because then the solutions for dealing with those failures shouldn&#039;t simply allow other ideologies, who will fail in the same way, to sweep in (can we change SJ for the better vs. razing it to the ground). 
I still see plenty of pro-SJ places where the motte reigns, and in fact are actively pushing back against those who take things too far, whereas you seem to only see the baileys run amuck. But if SJ&#039;s failings are that the baileys enable abuse, that&#039;s different from an ideology where the motte is about abuse. 

We could re-post all of these points about the things SJ does wrong, replaced with Christianity, but I don&#039;t see you hopping into every thread about that to pooh-pooh the Christians on the board about how their religion keeps getting warped into abusing people. Your objections appear asymmetrically.
(And yes, I acknowledge that SJ gone wrong is about how they ironically replicate conservative fundie mechanisms. But recognizing that horseshoe is precisely why I&#039;m not out there denouncing Christianity every change I get. It gets the same charity I give to SJ. Which works out on the ground, as I go to music ensemble rehearsals in a church with a prominent Social Justice section on their bulletin board, containing their volunteer sign-ups for their soup kitchen, and fly rainbow flags and hang &quot;Immigrants welcome&quot; banners out front.)]]></description>

@Aapje
The framework was first developed because a sufficient number of people had weaponized microaggressions, though, giving them the plausible deniablity that any one thing they did was a neutral act. Much of SJ&#039;s concepts were about that, words for how a harmless act in one context isn&#039;t harmless in another. 
&quot;[Color/gender]-blindness is at best a half-truth and those who don’t take it with a huge grain of salt (or those who weaponize it), are pushed to act very immorally.&quot;]]></description>

@AG

Where did I say &#039;uniquely?&#039;

And your other point applies to just about any conspiracy theory, including most of those that involve Jews. I think that there is a considerable difference between a theory that argues that people with certain demographic traits are pretty much all genetically or culturally disposed to harm and/or oppress those with (the) other demographic trait(s), vs merely arguing that a certain ideology encourages or mandates harmful and/or oppressive behavior against a group.]]></description>

@keaswaran

Yes, it&#039;s not a binary in the sense that it always is used against you. It just stacks the deck against you, so you are beholden to the charity of others. It&#039;s like a lower-status person dealing with a high-status person. In the case of conflict, the latter can deal far more damage. So the sensible thing for the lower-status person to do is to grovel when they need something that only the high-status ass person can provide and otherwise stick with other lower-status people.

And it&#039;s not even the case that most high-status people enjoy lording over others (or at least, not all of the time), so they also tend to prefer segregating their own kind.
