		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ve been re-reading the writings on Predictive Processing and in particular the notion of <a rel="nofollow"href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/03/08/ssc-journal-club-friston-on-computational-mood/">predicting good or bad outcomes with high or low confidence</a> and it really does seem like the &#8220;missing quadrant&#8221; of &#8220;good outcomes, low confidence&#8221; describes ADHD.</p>
<p> * Dopamine signals top-down confidence, right? ADHD is often rounded off to &#8220;Insufficient dopamine. Prescribe dopamine agonists.&#8221;, right?&#8221; </p>
<p> * A low-confidence prediction of a good outcome will lead you to start considering a behavior but not stick with it if you don&#8217;t see a sign of success to re-enforce that prediction. Instead, you&#8217;ll move on to the next low-confidence good outcome &#8212; classic distractability.</p>
<p> * A common symptom of ADHD is &#8220;hyperfocus&#8221;, getting sucked into a video game for 5 hours straight. That just sounds like you made a low confidence prediction of a good outcome, it kept getting rewarded and no other ideas seemed certain enough of a greater reward to pop you out of the thing that kept rewarding you.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>This morning I came across a mention of &#8220;French oatmeal&#8221; &#8211; soaking oats in eggs (plus a little milk and salt) and then frying it. Does anyone know how this works from a cooking theory perspective and what alterations might be worth trying? When I search oatmeal online, I find lots of references to cooking them in water or milk, but none in eggs. Anyone know why? </p>
<p>It seems like a sneaky way to turn an omelette into a pancake, which is attractive if you like pancakes and dislike omelettes like I do. Obviously the recipe was inspired by french toast, but my understanding is that french toast relies on the bread soaking up the eggs, and that oats won&#8217;t do that, so I&#8217;m not sure how much it actually has in common with french toast. Does anyone know the details?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>How long do you soak it in the eggs? If it&#8217;s an overnight type thing I would guess that the oats would soak up most the moisture.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I tried it this morning at one hour, but I thought the oats were insufficiently soft, so I made it again tonight after letting it soak all day (eight hours). Of course, in the later case I threw in some other ingredients too so it&#8217;s impossible to do a real comparison. </p>
<p>As far as time goes, the main constraint is impatience when cooking since doing the overnight soaks requires you to plan ahead and have a dish to spare.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yeah, that&#8217;s always been my problem with overnight oats as well. I was just trying to figure out how you are supposed to do this, since I&#8217;ve never heard of it, but it sounds like it could be interesting.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I have this recipe from my mother:<br />
Per Person<br />
&#8211; 100gr of oats<br />
&#8211; 1 or 2 eggs<br />
&#8211; ~50ml of vegetable stock<br />
&#8211; some fresh herbs if available<br />
mix season to taste, let soak for no more than 15minutes. With an soupspoon form small patties and fry from both sides until gold brown. Serve with a dip of fresh cheese or quark. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if that is the French version you were talking about, but it is quite tasty.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ve been growing hydroponics and was wondering where exactly the plants were obtaining the matter to grow so much so fast. Is it all from carbon in the air? The sunlight isn&#8217;t nearly enough energy to create that much matter (orders of magnitude off in fact), and the water levels barely drop day-to-day (though I do pour it out and replace the water daily). I had always just assumed that the matter came from the dirt but now I&#8217;m not sure.</p>
<p>If it is all from carbon in the air, I&#8217;m surprised. I guess there isn&#8217;t an intuitive way to understand the density of a gas because they&#8217;re all mostly invisible.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Ah, you&#8217;re certainly correct. I now remember that juicers are a thing and roughly 50% water weight seems reasonable.</p>
<p>From <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/effects-of-rising-atmospheric-concentrations-of-carbon-13254108/" rel="nofollow ugc">this nature article</a>: &#8220;Overall, the carbon, hydrogen and oxygen assimilated into organic molecules by photosynthesis make up ~96% of the total dry mass of a typical plant (Marschner 1995).&#8221; So even if you only look at the dry mass <i>and</i> include hydrogen from water you just barely get above 95%.</p>

So &gt;95% (excluding water, which it&#8217;s constantly soaking up in the roots and transpiring at the leaves) will be from CO2.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Armchair reasoning:<br />
The primary chemical reaction that produces plant matter, photosynthesis, turns CO2 and H2O into C6H12O6 (glucose) and O2. Masses of one atom each of C, H and O are 12:1:16, so 40% of the mass comes from the carbon in air, and 60% from water.<br />
To the extent that water can be dried out of a plant, more of the mass is water.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>I’ve been growing hydroponics and was wondering where exactly the plants were obtaining the matter to grow so much so fast. Is it all from carbon in the air?</p></blockquote>
<p>Typical plants are about 90% water. The dry mass is about 50% carbon from the air, the rest is oxygen (either from the air or from the water) and then hydrogen from the water molecules and nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, various metallic cations and small amounts of other elements from the stuff dissolved in the water.</p>
<blockquote><p>and the water levels barely drop day-to-day (though I do pour it out and replace the water daily)</p></blockquote>
<p>Some plants can absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<blockquote><p> I had always just assumed that the matter came from the dirt but now I’m not sure.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the contrary, the dirt (topsoil) accumulates when plants grow on it and erodes if the plants die.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Sometimes fantasy is based on grammatical mistakes.<br />
&#8220;Werewolf&#8221; is the Modern English spelling of Old English <i>werwulf</i>, &#8220;male human&#8221;* + &#8220;wolf&#8221;.<br />
*The gender-neutral <i>man</i> was modified with <i>wif</i> to make the earliest form of English &#8220;woman&#8221;.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewoman" rel="nofollow ugc">Wikipedia has a whole page for hilarious results of this confusion.</a><br />
But surely the sort of people who would read old texts might encounter other uses of Old English <i>wer(e)-</i>, like <i>weregild</i>, the heathen and early Germanic Christian fine for homicide. So why hasn&#8217;t the sort of fiction that produces female werewolves, werecats, <i>et al</i> misunderstood this into humans who turn into gold during the full moon?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>As amusing as all the hypotheticals are, I wonder if we could ask johan_larson&#8217;s friends in the sky to take away all plastics?  I have acquaintances who actually think this would be a good idea (saving the oceans and hormones and what not).  Just about everything around us contain plastics nowadays, but for many uses, you can image reverting to metal cans, cardboard boxes, cellulose, aluminum, and degradable additives.  If the aliens could be persuaded to simply let us stop producing plastic over a relatively short time, what would be irreplaceable, and what would markedly degrade quality of life?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Disclaimer:  I work in the plastic industry</p>
<p>Even &#8220;reverting to metal cans, cardboard boxes, etc.&#8221; carries significant cost.  While those types of containers are generally useable for the same things plastics are, they&#8217;re almost always more expensive, less durable, etc.</p>
<p>There are no small number of customers who have tried this (we&#8217;ll just use cardboard and metal instead!) in order to appease various &#8220;sustainability&#8221; demands placed on them by activist groups, only to eventually come crawling back&#8230;</p>
<p>And keep in mind, plastic is ultimately derived from crude oil, so the recent events related to a crude price collapse are going to make plastic&#8217;s cost advantage over other materials <i>that much more pronounced</i> for however long oil prices stay low.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Supposedly, phthalates are similar enough to estrogen to fool the body, and a bunch of scientists believe the ubiquity of plastics might be driving down sperm counts and causing odd varieties of testicular cancer.  But I&#8217;ve only heard about it from decidedly non-academic sources like <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.gq.com/story/sperm-count-zero" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.gq.com/story/sperm-count-zero</a> and such.  Was hoping you guys would have more insight into it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had three kids in less than ten years so I&#8217;m not personally all that fussed about sperm count, but it is creepy to contemplate.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Look around you, wherever you&#8217;re sitting right now. Everything you see that&#8217;s made of plastic would be somewhere between 20% and 500% more expensive. Some of the things not made of plastic would also be more expensive, since the tools or processes used to produce them might involve plastic.</p>

Both the uncoordinated protesters, the lack of coherent agenda, the violence of the protests, along with most protesters being peaceful, and the support of large sections of the population for the protests and their cause.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Our alien &#8220;friends&#8221; have wiped out all our electrical power plants. Pinpoint strikes by orbital deathrays have destroyed them all, whether powered by coal, gas, hydro, solar, wind, oil, geothermal, or nuclear reactors. All our gear that uses electrical power is still in place, as is the electrical distribution grid. Batteries are untouched, as are household and building-sized generators. But anything that can power even a neighborhood is gone.</p>
<p>How screwed are we?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Many people still have gas stoves which work when the power goer goes out. I would be able to cook (but not bake) in this scenario until the ensuing chaos collapsed the infrastructure to deliver gas as well. But since everything in my refrigerator and freezer would go bad, I&#8217;d be relying heavily on beans and rice, and that&#8217;s assuming water remained available.</p>

<p>The city water supply will likely have a decent amount of pressure until the water-tower is empty. The pumps that push filtered water up into the tower run on electricity, and may have a backup generator that would be considered a &#8216;building-size-generator&#8217;.  But if that generator runs out of fuel, and they can&#8217;t scrounge any fuel within a couple of days, the water pressure might be gone. And then once someone tries to get the water pressure back up, they&#8217;ll discover all the weak places in the pipe that collapsed once the pressure got too low.</p>
<p>For those with a natural-gas stove: the natural-gas supply might get spotty. I suspect that the control station for the natural-gas suppliers has its own backup-generator. They likely have a big control-board for pumps/valves/etc., and that board likely needs electricity to run.If that counts as a &#8216;building-size generator&#8217;, then everything is good for a little while. But it probably needs to have a person sitting at a control station to keep everything running properly. And that person might be trying to scrounge food/fuel/something for themselves, instead of sitting in the control center watching the system.</p>
<p>Hospitals typically have some sort of building-sized backup power generator, but I doubt they keep enough fuel for more than a week of loss-of-power. By the time that week is up, they will be hurting for fresh food. And fighting everyone else with a generator for fresh fuel.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t sound very good at all.</p>

<p>Badly. Mass deaths in the ensuing famine, total collapse of civilization is likely. Partial is unavoidable.</p>
<p>I wonder how many places will manage to restore and keep power, probably not enough to keep anything stable. Some places will have half-finished generators but&#8230;</p>
<p>Even with assumption of 100% effective leadership and lack of total societal collapse (despite famine and most of population dying)&#8230;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You could probably get a long way by using various vehicles as generators on wheels.</p>
<p>Is it possible to run an extension lead to a Nimitz? That gives you almost 0.2GW, or 0.04% of the average US electricity usage. </p>
<p>Naval gas turbines could also be used to power infrastructure on the coast.  </p>
<p>Diesel locomotives are usually serial-hybrid, so power can be drawn from them, too.  </p>
<p>Assuming hospitals already have backup gennies, I&#8217;d prioritise powering oil infrastructure (to run the combine harvesters and generators), communications (doesn&#8217;t use *too much* power) and the parts of heavy industry needed to rebuild our generating infrastructure.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think so- the propellers are mechanically driven from the steam turbines. In fact, AIUI the Nimitzes have had issues with limited electricity generating capacity and upggraded systems that require more power. The new Ford-class carriers  generate more electricity (partly because their catapults are electromagnetic not steam-powered), but they still IIRC don&#8217;t have the generating capacity to convert all of their reactor output to electricity. </p>
<p>Some other navies (and the Russian civilian icebreaker fleet) do have nuclear powered ships where the reactor powers a generator and the propellers are driven by electric motors. Similarly, some conventionally-powered warships use electric propulsion either completely (the Royal Navy&#8217;s Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers and Type 45 destroyers) or partially (the Type 23 destroyers, which use diesel generators driving electric motors for cruising, and gas turbines mechanically coupled to the propellers for high speeds).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I work in a chemical plant that produces chlorine by performing electrolysis on saltwater. This uses a ton of electricity. I&#8217;ve been told that our chlorine circuits are about 80% of the electrical power consumption of the entire site. A small town&#8217;s worth of air conditioners, heaters, pumps, machine tools, and welding equipment are the other 20%. So producing chlorine in any industrial quantity is probably right out. That means even if you somehow manage to keep indoor plumbing working, without water treatment we&#8217;re back to the days of dysentery and cholera.</p>
<p>I expect something else would collapse civilization before the lack of clean water but that&#8217;s the first thing that comes to mind.</p>

<p>Standing offer to buy such location, at prices that will ensure that company will prefer to sell it over destroying.</p>
<p>Such offer may be from public or private funds. (&#8220;My best test for a libertarian so far is to ask what needs to be done to protect ancient sequoias. If you say you need to buy them, you pass.&#8221;)</p>
<p>That assumes that such places are worth paying such price &#8211; it may or may not be true.</p>
<p>For bonus effect &#8211; couple it with social and legal penalties. But penalties alone will ensure that such things will be quietly destroyed as soon as spotted.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think the point here is for the government to step in and offer to buy the site at rates that are above what the market value of the site would otherwise be.</p>
<p>The assumption being that it&#8217;s hard to coordinate everyone that would be interested in preserving the archeological site and/or that it would be hard for the mining company (which is not set up for this kind of work) to find a buyer even if one existed.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Those who have replied so far in a thread created by the person who replied to this first, I want to be as charitable as possible, but I find your viewpoints to be maximally repellant.</p>
<p>I was going to argue that should this take on the value of our shared past dominate, we would completely lack the material to discuss the subject of the latest post on this blog (a posited fundamental shift in the workings of our minds, based on cultural changes around the bronze age). Now, I looked and I suppose true to form none of you commented on that, and perhaps it&#8217;s because you find such discussion to be sophistry or simply uninteresting, and maybe not, maybe you just didn&#8217;t have anything you felt compelled to comment, fair enough in any case. I put it to you that without the data from archeological study, any charlatan philosopher can make baseless claims on human behavior and the state of nature; and would you rather just do feral child studies to try and untangle the relation between human evolution, psychology, culture? Attempting to put together our earliest history from such fragments is a task probably doomed to meagre success, but at least those soft sciences which rely on evidence of the past have the potential to be hardest among them, should this evidence eventually be forthcoming and valued.</p>
<p>Without asking from whence we came, are we not as a whole living the unexamined life? In any case it seems a popular enough topic here to discuss how culture works, how it arises, its value even in the face of its irrationality. To Chris Phoenix, I apologize for not answering the question, the practical matter of how to preserve such sites is important, but there are also those whose views are not captured by your original post, who are not moved by this even so far as to shake their heads.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair to judge people based on what they <i>didn&#8217;t </i>say, particularly on-line in a crowded discussion forum.<br />

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Sorry, I think this is a place where I argued internally and made some salient points on both sides and then wrote as though everyone had witnessed it, funnily enough a basic theory of mind failure that came from insufficient care; that&#8217;s there because at first I was going to write from a place of assuming that the latest post would be of interest to anyone here, but I thought it would first make sense to check whether anyone I was reacting to had actually engaged with said post. I&#8217;m trying to grant that there may be those for whom such discussion seems valueless, and I do mean that whether anyone believes that or just hadn&#8217;t commented on that post for any other reason, I consider that fair enough.</p>

<p>This is why we have <a rel="nofollow"href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/22/enacted/en/print" rel="nofollow ugc">regulations</a> around building on <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/02/artifacts-found-under-london-archaeology/" rel="nofollow ugc">historical sites</a>, because there were cases of &#8220;oh crap, just excavated a Roman lead coffin, if we tell the archaeologists about it then everything will have to shut down while they excavate and we need to get this construction project finished fast, just dump the thing somewhere and forget all about it&#8221;.</p>

<p>What is wrong with reality-based policies?</p>
<p>Why you consider &#8220;maximally repellant&#8221; to protect valuable archeological materials by taking account that some people are greedy, especially ones leading companies?</p>
<p>What is wrong with considering as acceptable to penalize people for destroying archeological materials (while not considering it as sufficient)?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Wow, my comment hasn&#8217;t gone well. I was talking about the other thread of responses, not yours, and I felt uncomfortable calling anyone out by name while calling their views repellant, but I really should have done so to be more clear and less cowardly. I thought your response was extremely reasonable and on point, I agree with it entirely. My comment is directed at the idea that there are those who don&#8217;t take the values behind the original question for granted, that such sites have intrinsic value. Reading my comment as a response to yours, I&#8217;m not surprised it seemed incoherent.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yes and no.  It was centered around the chariot factions, but those factions played a prominent political role in the city&#8211;they&#8217;d grown beyond mere sports affiliations&#8211;and the protests were rooted in dissatisfaction with Justinian&#8217;s policies.  The emperor came in, sat down, and was presented with a bunch of guys screaming &#8220;Nika! Nika!&#8221; right at him in a threatening way.  He freaked out, everything got out of hand, and eventually something like 30K people got slaughtered in the Hippodrome IIRC.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Football clubs were an important part of the Arab Spring.<br />
I said it on this site bevore, I think the reason is obvious. For an authocratic regime an sports club is a way young man can channel their energy with out organizing politically. Thats why the internal intelligence agencies allow those groups to organize big groups of young man, with out having to much of a tap on them. This usually works well to distract this young organized men from politics, until it stops working.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yes, but the Blues and Greens had grown beyond that, to the point where eventually there were official duties for them, and a designated spot for their representatives in parades and city functions.  There&#8217;s no straightforward modern analog for them.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Of course, in the Eastern Bloc the internal intelligence agencies tended to organize their own sports clubs, usually called Dynamo (the original Dynamo Sports Society was founded by Dzerzhinsky). </p>
<p>The most infamous of these was Dynamo Berlin- perhaps because, while the power bases of Dynamo Moscow&#8217;s rivals (the Army for CSKA, the trade unions for Spartak) could rival the Interior Ministry, the Stasi&#8217;s control of East German society was unrivalled.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Ancient warfare was based on food. Consider:</p>
<p>A man marching needs 3000 calories a day. This is two loaves of bread, or 5 pounds. A man can carry 75 pounds for long durations, but more weight causes long term problems. This is only a 15 day supply of food. </p>
<p>But what about water? A man needs 2 gallons a day, and a gallon of water is 10 pounds. So now a man can carry only a 3 day supply through a desert. </p>
<p>Can someone else carry food to the army? No. A man porting the food to the army still needs to eat. Even a horse, which can carry multiple times what a man does, needs to eat the same multiple more (camels have the same problem). Horses are good for carrying tents, or things which require multiple men to carry, but otherwise are no better than letting humans carry it. What about carts and wheels? These work, but are slow and unwieldy. For example, Alexander the Great made his army carry all their equipment so they did not get attached and bring too much waste in carts. Carts cannot also travel where there are not roads. Food CAN be ported in over boats, which is why traveling along the coast and rivers is possible. </p>
<p>Consider that the interior of Papua New Guinea was discovered only recently by explorers, even though the island has been colonized for hundreds of years. The mountains are too dense and do not contain food and water. Since you cannot carry more than a three day supply, and the trip is longer than 3 days you cannot make it through the mountains. If I recall they airdropped food from helicopters (helicopters could not land in the interior because there was nowhere flat to land. All trees. I suppose they could have airdropped people but whatever)</p>
<p>There is some land which armies cannot travel over. If too little food, and nothing in vicinity that can be carted in, an army cannot travel through the land. Even in fertile lands, the army may eat all the food and be unable to retreat back over the land. Armies without sea access also cannot sit and wait forever, they must move. Sometimes this forces armies into bad battles. </p>
<p>When armies must travel through the Middle East, they can either travel along very obvious routes, such as down the Tigris/Euphrates, or they can split up the army into pieces. This is why armies tend to split up for the winter and campaign in spring/summer. But armies frequently are ambushed in the winter by locals while they are split up. </p>
<p>Games like Risk (and even more advanced games) do not take into account the carrying capacity of the land to support an army, and do not take into account seasons and depletion of food. In Risk, there is no reason not to ball your entire army into one blob. </p>
<p>These factors mean that there are maximum army sizes and very narrow paths for them to travel. It also means that burning your own land is a foolproof strategy that defeats any invading army (though may alienate your subjects in the burned regions). The German tribes would intentionally create wastelands around their borders for this purpose. </p>
<p>Fun fact:<br />
If a road is ten men shoulder to shoulder wide, and your army is 60,000 men, then your army is 6,000 men long. If the first man begins marching, and the second man in line takes a second to begin, then the man at the back of the army won’t take his FIRST step until after 6000 seconds, which is equal to 100 minutes, or over an hour and a half. This of course assumes that every soldier has an immediate response when it’s his turn to take a step, which is very optimistic. The whole process needs to be repeated whenever the army encounters and obstacle, and when it stops for the night. The army MUST move in formation like this, otherwise, the army gets too strung out to defend itself.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p><a rel="nofollow"href="https://acoup.blog/" rel="nofollow ugc">A Collection of Unmitigated Pedantry</a> makes the point on <i>one</i> of its posts (I cannot remember which one) that one of the ways that history&#8217;s greatest generals, like Alexander or Napoleon, were able to secure the wins they did was their ability to, at the right time for the right battle, <i>leap</i> off their logistics trail across ground they either shouldn&#8217;t have been able to cover while maintaining good supply or shouldn&#8217;t have been able to cover so quickly.

<p>Napoleon&#8217;s capacity to defeat his enemies in detail before larger coalition forces could join up was specifically attributed to his instinct for leaving his logistics behind when the risk was worth it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>This was also what made Ulysses S. Grant such a brilliant general. His reputation as a butcher is mostly based on the Overland campaign in the constrained Virginia theater and lots of Lost Cause revisionism. But Grant&#8217;s capture of Vicksburg in 1863 is one of the most brilliant in the history of warfare.</p>
<p>To sum up: Vicksburg was a fortified city sitting high on a bluff above the Mississippi River. North and west of the city were mostly impassable swamps and absolutely no good roads. To the east was Jackson, the state capital, and a large garrison of rebels. The terrain was easier to the south, but there was no way to get to the south on account of all the other terrain in the way. The rebels figured Vicksburg was impregnable, because any Union approach to the city had to either come down the river from the north &#8211; where they&#8217;d run smack into the swamps and get massacred (this happened to the first Union attempt on the city in December 1862), or they&#8217;d have to approach slowly overland from the north, and their supply lines couldn&#8217;t be held against cavalry raiders like Nathan Bedford Forrest.</p>
<p>Grant spent months trying to work out a way to get an army into the open country south of Vicksburg, with lots of increasingly zany and desperate engineering schemes meant at slipping boats past the city so he could maintain his line of supply south of the city. They all failed, though, so Grant (some say inspired by a Union cavalry raid that rode straight through Mississippi from Tennesee to Union-held New Orleans and never wanted for food) decided, &#8220;Fuck it,&#8221; ran his transports past the batteries (not without loss), marched his army down the far side of the river, then launched himself into enemy territory.</p>
<p>When Grant landed behind Vicksburg in late April 1863, he was cut off from his own base of supplies, in hostile territory with an unfriendly populace and only his own scouting to rely on, and quite probably outnumbered in toto by all the enemy troops in the area. But those troops were scattered all to hell and back, so before they could concentrate against him, Grant marched hundreds of miles rapidly, beat 3 separate armies in 5 separate battles, driving the rebels every which direction, captured Jackson and tore up the railroads for miles in every direction, preventing Johnston from bringing reinforcements against him, then turned and penned the main rebel army up in Vicksburg. All in the space of about two weeks, totally in the air as far as logistics were concerned. Only once Vicksburg was safely besieged did he re-establish his supply lines to the north, now that the enemy armies could no longer interfere. The city that was supposed to be impossible to take was captured in just a few months.</p>
<p>Sherman later repeated the same tactic of cutting loose from his supply lines in order to reach an important objective where he could re-establish himself in his March to the Sea. WHen he cut loose and marched into the heart of Georgia, Jefferson Davis thundered that his fate would be same as Napoleon&#8217;s army when it marched to Moscow. </p>
<p>Grant supposedly quipped in reply, &#8220;Who is to furnish the snow for this march?&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The &#8220;Grant the Butcher&#8221; legend is a mischaracterization even for the Overland campaign. To oversimplify, the recurring theme of Grant&#8217;s operations in Virginia was:<br />
1. Grant disengages and sets off in an unexpected direction to get around Lee&#8217;s flank<br />
2. Lee scrambles his army off to block a key choke-point and avoid being cut off from his own supply lines once he realizes what Grant is doing<br />
3. A bloody meeting-engagement battle ensues at the choke point as the two armies arrive piecemeal.<br />
4. Grant stops assaulting Lee&#8217;s positions once it becomes clear he won&#8217;t be able to overwhelm them at a reasonable cost.<br />
5. Grant&#8217;s main force besieges Lee&#8217;s position for a period of days or weeks.<br />
6. Repeat.</p>
<p>This cycle gets stuck on step 5 for a while at Petersburg and the outskirts of Richmond, where Lee&#8217;s strategic lines are now short enough that Grant doesn&#8217;t have good opportunities to outflank him strategically. Grant tries a series of direct assaults and tactical flanking maneuvers over the course of the siege, eventually succeeding in one of the flanking maneuvers (Five Forks) and forcing Lee to retreat and abandon both Richmond and Petersburg.</p>
<p>Then we get into the Appomattox campaign, where Lee is trying to disengage and link up with the other major remaining Confederate field army and Grant is trying to stop him. That ends when Grant finally succeeds at getting around Lee&#8217;s flank and boxing him in between two superior forces without hope of relief or resupply, and Lee does the obvious thing and surrenders.</p>
<p>Overall, my read of the campaigns is that Grant is still a very capable strategist and army organizer, but Lee is also a good enough strategist and organizer (especially with the advantages of strategic defense and operating on interior lines) that Grant has to grind him down gradually rather than being able to win a dazzling series of victories the way he did at Vicksburg.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Right. I endorse all of that. Plus, we&#8217;re leaving out the fact that Grant was repeatedly let down by his subordinates, which is the only reason the siege even happened to begin with. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean that as excuse making. Grant&#8217;s initial plan to capture Richmond was, well, McClellan&#8217;s, because that was frankly the best way to seize the city &#8211; a landing on the peninsula to bypass all those nasty rivers and tangled woods defended by the Army of Northern Virginia, with secure supply lines, and then set about taking Richmond by siege. But that was forbidden by Washington since the political consequences of returning to the failed Peninsular venture would be disastrous &#8211; northern morale was VERY low in spring 1864. </p>
<p>So Grant&#8217;s second plan had the Army of the Potomac making the main thrust south from Washington, but it was mostly there to tie up Lee. I don&#8217;t know if it was technically the &#8220;main effort&#8221; in military terms, but Grant hoped to quickly seize Petersburg and Richmond with a swift blow from a <i>second</i> army, the Army of the James, made up mostly of soldiers who had been faffing about up and down the Carolina coasts for two years. They would sail up the York river, land south of it, and seize Petersburg, which would cut Richmond off from the rest of the south. With Lee&#8217;s army tied up in the north, the Army of the James would be more or less uncontested. If Lee turned south to strike that army, Grant would follow hard on his heels and catch the rebels in a pincer. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, Grant was forced to appoint Butler to command the army, since Butler was one of the last surviving War Democrats and again, northern morale. Need those Democrat votes to maintain the war effort. And Butler bungled things horribly, getting the entire army bottled up in the Bermuda Hundred peninsula by a vastly inferior army under P. G. T. Beauregard. &#8220;Butler in the bottle&#8221; became a famous expression, even. </p>
<p>Grant then had a SECOND chance to seize Petersburg without a siege. After fighting his way across northern Virginia in the manner you described, he then slipped south of the James without Lee catching wise, and this time had Petersburg dead to rights. Now, Grant was still on the northern side of the river overseeing the delicate act of crossing right under Lee&#8217;s nose, so the assault on Petersburg was left to Hancock and Warren, both of whom cocked it up again. Beauregard was again able to hold things together with spit and duct tape until Lee realized what was happening and rushed reinforcements in, and at that point, Grant had no choice but to steadily work his way further and further around Lee&#8217;s flank until at last the rebels were stretched too thin and broke. That took 9 months of patient siege work.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Ancient warfare was based on food.</p></blockquote>
<p>A better take would be ancient warfare, like modern warfare, is constrained by logistics. You&#8217;re specifically talking about the concept of what I&#8217;ve heard called an operational tether. This is basically a concept that operations have limited ranges based on their logistical constraints. For example, if you want to put an occupational force into the field indefinitely then the occupational tether of that force is the maximum limit at which you can indefinitely sustain the occupational force. Meanwhile, a raid has a much longer tether because its tether is only the distance at which you can sustain the relevant force for however long a raid takes. This is why Native Americans had much longer range operations than contemporary Europeans despite having much worse logistics: they fought by ambush and raid rather than protracted siege.</p>
<blockquote><p>The German tribes would intentionally create wastelands around their borders for this purpose.</p></blockquote>
<p>Caesar reports this but I see no reason to believe it was different from the phenomenon of other hunter-gatherers we see, where they fight over control of empty land where they hunt and gather. If you read the passage carefully Caesar specifically mentions that the purpose of their warfare is to drive their opponents out of their fields (since they practiced some agriculture) and villages and put them further at a distance. He also says that one of their primary economic activities was hunting. Hunting takes a lot of empty land. And we&#8217;ve seen this dynamic in more modern tribal groups, so it seems like a pretty obvious inference to me.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as Caesar points out, they do not expect it to prevent a siege (indeed he doesn&#8217;t mention walls and emphasizes the lack of permanent structures) but that it makes ambush and raids on their own villages harder. He specifically says that it makes such attacks less likely, not impossible, so they apparently still happened. He is talking about tribal raid warfare. The point is to create a physical yet economically productive barrier between them and potential opponents. This did little to stop an army like the Romans or Gauls, who they basically ran from. (Caesar somehow doesn&#8217;t pick up on the dissonance of saying the Germans are stronger than the Gauls yet knows the Gauls are <i>colonizing the Germans</i>. Colonizing generally requires being stronger.)</p>
<p>Likewise, archeological evidence shows that the German strategy against the Romans (and previously the Gauls) was to deny them the existence of the urban centers and fortresses they relied on to effectively govern a territory. When the Germans had the Romans on the backfoot, they immediately went around attacking things like forums or destroying oppidum. This made them effectively ungovernable except through the medium of tribal politics, something the Germans could do quite naturally but the Romans and Gauls were not used to. It was a strategy of illegible resistance against a stronger opponent.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Gauls had explicitly colonized the most desirable parts of Germany (that they knew of) prior to the arrival of Caesar.</p>

<p>Link? I&#8217;m curious to see what the composition is and how much we can sustain Caesar&#8217;s claims through looking at it as gathering rather than agriculture. (Since, after all, gathering produces plants and not animals.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m fully willing to believe I&#8217;m wrong but it&#8217;s important to note the degree of settlement, technology, and homogeneity among early Germans is somewhat controversial. Or rather, there&#8217;s a general consensus that isn&#8217;t very popular with various nationalists. And there were some since discredited ideas in the 19th and early to mid 20th century.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ariovist settled Gaulish territory against the local tibes/polices wish. They called in Cesar to get rid of them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes. Likewise the Romans settled allied tribes on territory they controlled, which meant the Romans were stronger than the original inhabitants of the territory, not the allied tribes.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>This was interesting, and my comment is tangential to your main point, but the highlands of Papua New Guinea have been inhabited for thousands of years and are not really short on food or water. In fact, I would say subsistence agriculture there is easy compared to many parts of the world since irrigation is typically not required. I normally live there myself, and we meet all of our water needs with rainwater and much of our food is local as well. I think the reasons for the late exploration of the highlands are somewhat complicated, but probably had more to do with the very imposing terrain, along with Europeans not understanding the extent to which the interior was populated (which is somewhat baffling since there has always been extensive trade between the coast and interior, but it seems like people just didn&#8217;t ask about it or something). It would have been relatively easy to trade for food in the interior at any rate.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I work for a Bible translation organization (PNG has 800+ distinct languages) as a sysadmin / network admin. Some of the work is pretty typical, but also some weird stuff like email over shortwave radio. I&#8217;m originally from the US, we came back for my wife to give birth and now we&#8217;re stuck here because of the plague.</p>
<p>The culture over there is pretty far out from a Western perspective. It&#8217;s a VERY communal culture. Major social problems are tribal violence and killings over sorcery accusations. A funny/sad anecdote: One of the groups near us was at war with a neighboring tribe, and mercenaries are a thing there. Someone with a cell phone got ahold of an old Rambo movie and showed it to everyone, and they were all like, &#8220;This Rambo guy took out 100 people on his own, clearly he&#8217;s the best mercenary out there, this is the guy we need!&#8221;, and were trying to figure out how to hire him.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The existence of water, and food if it is accessible to marching soldiers, or exploreres are different things.<br />
In hilly, mountainous, and wooded terrain, drinkable water, might not be easy to find for a none local. If the local people don&#8217;t want to supply them with food, it might be hard to even find their villages. It is not unusual for the people in the interior of islands to not want to support the litoral powers. And even if you have a string of villages that are ready to supply you, in this kind of terrain with out good roads, even 15km might take one or two days of travell.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Quantity matters.  Armies require a <i>lot</i> of food and water, and &#8220;drinking rivers dry&#8221; is only mostly a figure of speech.  If all you&#8217;ve got are streams, small ponds, and springs, the local tribes may be doing fine but the land can still be impassible to armies.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I agree that the interior would not have provided enough food for a large army, but a smaller exploration team would not have been a problem. You can literally carry a tarp and collect enough rain water to drink probably 9 months out of the year. My understanding is that the Europeans somehow didn&#8217;t know the interior was inhabited, which is a bit odd since there are trade routes through the country. One possibility is that the local groups on the coast only knew about the next group or 2 along the route but not any farther. The country has a huge number of languages which could have exacerbated this.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>German soliders are(were?) expected to do 30 kilometers in under 6 hours, in full kit, at least once a month.  I heared several stories from people stationed at different locations that most of the &#8220;full time soldiers&#8221; did them a lot faster, since you get weekend leave after you completed the march.<br />
If we expect the distance the legions covered daily to be around 30 kilometers, and trained Roman legionaries were able to move at least as fast as modern Germans that completed basic training:<br />
~6 A.M. waking call<br />
~7 &#8211; 7:30 A.M. the head of the coloumn leaves the evening camp.<br />
~8 &#8211; 8:30 A.M. the end of the coloumn leaves the camp.<br />
~1 &#8211; 1:30 P.M. the head of the coloumn reaches the new camp, and starts to secure the area. All incoming legionaries split into guard, or dig in duty.<br />
~2 &#8211; 2:30 P.M. The end of the coloumn reaches the new camp.<br />
This leaves easily three or four hours of daylight to dig in, even in winter on the nothern side of the Alps.<br />
If you are close to the enemy, or in difficult ground were you move slower, or need to scout more, you do less distance a day. Remeber the camps behind you also serve to hold your supply line open. Moving slower but having a line of fortified camps, to resuply just in case might save your ass.</p>
<p>Ninja Edit: Yes this isn&#8217;t exactly the modern 9to5 workday, but I don&#8217;t expect anyone to do an eight hour day back than. And I also doubt a legion would have been expected to keep up that pace for more than a couple of weeks.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Another thing you need to remeber: Mules also do not move more than 30 kilometers a day. Ox- and horse carts even less. Even if the ideal of the Roman legionary tells us he carries all his gear himself, Romans did have a bagage train.<br />
Moving so moving much faster than that wasn&#8217;t possible anyways.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The Romans marched hard, too, as a consequence of being some of the only professional soldiers in a world of civilian militias and tribal levies. Vegetius says the legionaries were expected to cover 30 km in 6 hours of marching, or roughly 5 km an hour, which is a pretty rapid walking pace. With ~12 hours of daylight in the campaigning season, that still left plenty of sun to set up the camp at the end of the march, and the set up could be done rapidly since everything was standardized and everyone knew his job.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The article notes that Israel&#8217;s having one of the problems that I believe the US is now experiencing &#8211; that once people start relaxing, it&#8217;s hard to get enough people to show up for testing to monitor for community spread.</p>
<p>IIRC, early estimates were that we would need somewhere between 1 million tests/week and 1 million/day to monitor and control spread, but it turns out that it&#8217;s pretty hard to get those people to show up and get tested. You could imagine telling everyone with a social security number ending in 01 to get tested this week, but it&#8217;s harder to imagine many of them showing up.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>All you really need to do a test on someone is a couple of cotton swabs, right? I wonder if it would make sense to set up some teams to just go door to door sampling one person per household. I&#8217;d guess that if the testers come to people, the people would be a lot more likely to get tested.</p>

<p>No, you also need reagents and it&#8217;s not that hard to run out of them.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If you just want overall community levels, you can apparently get that by monitoring sewage.</p>
<p>From what I understand, we don&#8217;t have standards around it, but could probably figure it out with a big push and have it be accurate to within a factor of 3.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll still need door-to-door for places where most people don&#8217;t use a public sewer system.</p>
<p>@albatross11: You might want some peace of mind, or be able to isolate yourself from your loved ones if sick. A guy without those, and/or who just refuses? Doesn&#8217;t seem right to force him.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p><b>Have been commenting a bit less, but the Dutch expressions keep coming.</b></p>
<p>&#8216;Tuig van de richel&#8217; = Scum of the ledge</p>
<p>Riffraff. One theory is that this refers to the cheap seats in the theater, which were called the ledge. Another possibility is that it derives from &#8216;vee van de richel&#8217; = cattle from the ledge, which referred to ledge that cattle would stand on (and perhaps deposit their manure onto).</p>
<p>The word &#8216;tuig&#8217; is also interesting. It originally meant rig or gear and is still used in many words like:<br />
&#8211; &#8216;werktuig&#8217; = literally work gear, but better translated as tool<br />
&#8211; &#8216;vistuig&#8217; = fishing gear (anything meant to catch fish: nets, rods, lines, weights, etc)<br />
&#8211; &#8216;vliegtuig&#8217; = literally flying rig, but really an airplane<br />
&#8211; &#8216;zintuig&#8217; = sense. &#8216;Sin&#8217; is an old Dutch word that is extremely similar to &#8216;sense,&#8217; having many comparable meanings.</p>
<p>&#8216;Tuig&#8217; gained an additional meaning of low quality gear and then was applied to low quality people.</p>
<p>&#8216;Dat zit wel snor&#8217; = That&#8217;s rather moustache</p>
<p>That is or will be all right. First know use in 1948. May have military origins. There is no sensible explanation for why people adopted this expression.</p>
<p>&#8216;Je snor drukken&#8217; = Press your mustache</p>
<p>Being absent or shirking an obligation or duty. The Dutch word for pressing can also be used to mean: lowering something. For example, in this fixed expression:<br />
&#8216;Dat kon de pret niet drukken&#8217; = that couldn&#8217;t press the fun (= that didn&#8217;t reduce the fun we had).</p>
<p>This probably led to the word being used to indicate that someone is trying to hide himself when tasks are being assigned, by effaceing themselves. The addition of the mustache may be a joke or may refer to people covering their mouth and upper lip with their hand, in an overt gesture that they won&#8217;t volunteer themselves and/or to be less recognizable in a group and thus passed over more easily.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>For the &#8220;Scum of the ledge&#8221;, there is a nice English expression, too: <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut_gallery" rel="nofollow ugc">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut_gallery</a></p>
<p>Of course we have the same word in German: &#8220;Zeug&#8221;, and &#8220;Werkzeug&#8221;, &#8220;Flugzeug&#8221;. It can also be slightly pejorative and mean &#8220;stuff&#8221;. But we don&#8217;t have zintuig (&#8220;Sinnzeug&#8221;?), and that&#8217;s a pity. (Unless Heidegger conjured it up; he seemed to have had his own private definition for &#8220;Zeug&#8221;, as for several other words.) I particularly like the expression: &#8220;Heb je zin in een biertje?&#8221; = &#8220;Do you have sense in a beer?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nobody says &#8220;Das ist mir Schnurrbart&#8221;, but people would understand it as &#8220;Das ist mir egal&#8221;, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care&#8221;, because there are several expressions for &#8220;I don&#8217;t care&#8221;: &#8220;Das ist mir wurscht&#8221; (that is sausage to me; yes, it should be &#8220;Wurst&#8221;, but in Swabia they pronounce s as sch, they say &#8220;Augschburg&#8221;), &#8220;Das ist mir Latte&#8221; (piece of wood), &#8220;Das ist mir Hupe&#8221; (signal horn), &#8220;Das ist mir wumpe&#8221; (no idea what that means), &#8220;Das ist mir Banane&#8221;, &#8220;Das ist mir schnuppe&#8221; (apparently, a charred candle wick! Well I never)&#8230;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>What are people&#8217;s thoughts on Nassim Taleb these days? I really enjoyed nearly all of his books, including &#8220;Antifragile&#8221;, which I found very compelling. I admire him as someone who is erudite, knows lots of languages and history, and seems to practice what he preaches.<br />
At the same time, I feel like he punts on issues a lot of the times. Not that he, or anyone, owes the world their time, but I feel like if you&#8217;re going to be commenting very strongly and acidly on Covid19, you should probably have a comment on Covid19 and these riots, and not pretend that they aren&#8217;t happening?<br />
I went to a talk by him, and it was very short, unclear and unprepared.<br />
I find him calling &#8220;bullshitters&#8221; people who I think deserve at least an acknowledgement, especially because they seem to behave in a way that accords with the ethical system put forth in &#8220;Antifragile&#8221;. (I&#8217;m thinking e.g. of Sam Harris leaving Patreon on principle and taking a financial hit.) </p>
<p>This is a bit rambly, but I know other people on here like him so I thought I&#8217;d ask.</p>

<p>Taleb has a thing for engaging with people in an unhelpfully combative way. Don&#8217;t ever visit his Twitter, for instance.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I can take or leave his ideas, with the leave option being made easier by his manifest narcissism. He seems to think that people make the institutional and personal decisions that they do because they&#8217;re stupid have a poor understanding of uncertainty. I&#8217;d be fairly sure he&#8217;s wrong and that they understand uncertainty just fine; they don&#8217;t act on it because the emotional cost of challenging social hierarchies is too high, especially if you have a functioning theory of mind.

		<div class="comment-body"><p>His one idea (the black swan which is more or less the core of his work that I have read) is, if correct, the most important idea in finance in the last century.  IMO his clarity, writing style and personality all leave a huge amount to be desired, I&#8217;ve written this before but I think the key point in TBS is in a footnote which changes the fundamental claim in the book.  This is extremely sloppy, and I think it is almost entirely on himself that he is misunderstood so frequently.  That he is misunderstood so frequently is probably one aspect to why he is so belligerent/intolerant which is what makes him likely to be a modern day Cassandra.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve basically stopped reading him/listening to him because I can&#8217;t tell without going through his words really carefully if he is being subtle, brilliant and insightful or just obvious and pompous, and its the latter to often.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Can&#8217;t copy paste so any typos likely mine.  I misrememberd, its a 2 parter, both footnotes.</p>
<blockquote><p>I used the logical metaphor of the black swan (not capitalized) for Black Swan events (capitalized), but this problem should not be confused with the logical problem raised by many philosophers.  This is not so much about expectations as it is about the oversized role of extreme events in many domains  in life.  Futhermore, the logical problem is about the possibility of the exception (black swan), mine is about the role of the exceptional event (Black Swan) leading to a degredation of predictability and the need to be robust to negative Black Swans and exposed to positive ones.  </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>It is worth mentioning here that one of the mistakes people make in the interpretation of the Black Swan idea is that they believe that Black Swans are more frequent than in our imagination.  Not quite the point.  Black Swans are more consequential, not necessarily more frequent.  There are actually fewer remote events but they are more and more extreme in their impact, which confuses people, as they tend to write them off more easily. </p></blockquote>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>His one idea (the black swan which is more or less the core of his work that I have read) is, if correct, the most important idea in finance in the last century</p></blockquote>
<p>If this were true, I think NT would be exponentially richer than he is.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t tell how bright or how correct most people are simply by looking at their bank balances, but I think returns are an entirely fair way to judge the competence and insight of someone who spent several decades managing money.</p>
<p>If his idea was actually the most important in finance in the past century, he&#8217;d have made billions before he wrote the book and explained it to the world. Instead, everything I&#8217;ve read suggest his returns were mediocre at best. (The Falkenstein post linked above suggests that Victor Niederhoffer, who plays the conventional fool to NT&#8217;s maverick genius in the Malcolm Gladwell profile that made NT famous, out-earned him.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>If this were true, I think NT would be exponentially richer than he is.</p></blockquote>
<p>Taleb&#8217;s position is that the infrequent events are of over-sized importance, since TBS came out in 2007 I think it would generally be wrong to say that without knowing how well he did financially within the past 3 months given what has happened, nor how well he did during 2007-2009.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yeah, I enjoy his books as well, and can even put up with the name-dropping and the silly bits of Fat Tony fiction mixed in. And he cowrote a paper on Covid 19 in late January, so I got to give him credit for that. But yeah, like Nick says, his Twitter feed  is a lot of ad hominems about people like Phil &#8220;the rat&#8221; Tetlock, where he takes far too long to get to the point of contention he has with said rat. And sometimes he doesn&#8217;t even bother doing that, and just hurls insults. Oh, and he has a weird obsession with squid ink pasta. Which I suppose is harmless, and might even be a charming addition to someone else&#8217;s Twitter feed, but it&#8217;s an oddly thing  to interrupt all the vitriol with.</p>
<p>I hope in a future book he&#8217;ll write more about localism. He throws the word around a lot, but a Lebanese guy who lives in New York, made his millions on international markets, and occasionally lectures at the London School of Economics doesn&#8217;t really seem like the poster child for localism.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>He&#8217;s been right about everything!

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;d argue <i>Antifragile</i> is his key work, in that it summarises all his early works and reframes them in a way that is bigger than the sum of it&#8217;s parts.  Taleb&#8217;s main contributions are his work on highly nonlinear systems and the properties of tail-events, and highlighting the dangers of &#8216;simplified&#8217; mathematical tools used by economists.  For this I think he&#8217;s an incredibly important and timely thinker and most people involved in risk should read his work closely.  His mathematical detours and technical notes are brilliant.</p>
<p>Where he falls down is his over-willingness to burn bridges in his interactions with society and his preference to insult people rather than plainly state his point.  It&#8217;s a shame because if he put his mind to it he could probably change the way industry and academy do things to better match what he so passionately thinks they have an obligation to do.  </p>
<p>I think as far as he&#8217;s concerned, he&#8217;s made his money, he&#8217;s shown us all why we&#8217;ve all been stupid, and if we still keep blowing things up then that&#8217;s just what you get for being a sucker.  Gabish?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>A parenting advice question, if anyone has suggestions or relevant experience, on dealing with a middle child surpassing their older sibling in some academic front.</p>
<p>Our oldest child is 6 1/2 and just finishing kindergarten. She&#8217;s doing fine, about average for her class at reading and well above average at math.  We&#8217;ve been doing a lot of reading practice and lessons at home throughout the year, but especially since the schools went remote since it&#8217;s such a foundational skill.  Middle child just turned 4 and was interested in the reading lessons too (I&#8217;ve been using a DISTAR related phonics book to teach them both, it seems to align well with how they were teaching in her kindergarten).  Anyways he&#8217;s been doing really, really well with it.  It&#8217;s all organized into challenges of increasing difficulty and he&#8217;s been rapidly catching up to older sibling.  At current trend, sometime in ~ the next week or two he&#8217;s going to pass in her in level of reading difficulty, a prospect he is super excited about.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how to manage that milestone (if indeed I should manage it all). He&#8217;s a (barely) 4 year old, a bit competitive (middle child?), and honestly not unlikely to be a bit of dick about it (not in an intentional mean way, more of an excited belaboring a point to death not reading the crowd sort of way).  The older one hasn&#8217;t expressed any direct feelings about it, though she has been more sensitive about him reading (e.g. when reading stories I usually pick out easy sentences to let one or the other of them read, and lately she&#8217;s been requesting that in stories she picks he doesn&#8217;t do any reading / gets annoyed when he wants to read a lot of the story he picks [they share a room so we usually do bedtime stories together]).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if emphasizing areas, like math, she&#8217;s still much stronger then him in is a good approach or just setting up further issues if he surpasses her in that too sometime down the line. Or if there&#8217;s some other approach that would work well. I&#8217;d hope to avoid her pulling back from reading, which I know she&#8217;s found challenging at times, as a defense mechanism. I had a bit of a similar dynamic with my sister growing up, but it was reversed since I was older so while it was a bit of her having to live in my shadow it&#8217;s not quite the same thing.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>On the upside, it will be a great teaching experience. Life is filled with people who are able to do things you value yet struggle at with unconcerned ease, and vice versa. So it&#8217;s a chance to train them in graceful behavior.  That said, it is nice for each child to have an individual niche that they can claim as their own, though of course it can&#8217;t be as expansive as &#8216;reading&#8217; or &#8216;math&#8217; since all kids need  a decent foundation of these. When one child&#8217;s passion is impinged by another, there&#8217;s going to be friction. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example/brag from our house. Our middle child is passionate about horses. Each child has their own favorite animal, cats, horses, and dogs, respectively by age, which they theme their clothes, toys, and stories after as much as possible. But middle daughter has been devoted to horses with a greater fervor, and as a result was one of youngest members of the local 4H horse project, and the only rider their club entered into the virtual competition held yesterday. Her older sister recently joined the club, partly since it&#8217;s a much better Covid activity than being in plays. Oldest child gets to be shown up by her younger sister&#8217;s much greater experience and expertise, while younger sister gets to have her passion made somewhat less unique, a sore spot for a middle born. Honestly, they&#8217;re handling it pretty well without a lot of intervention, but we&#8217;ve tried to prepare them both by discussing that the older one has her own strengths, and she may need to struggle and/or accept help from the younger since age doesn&#8217;t automatically equal expertise, and stress the joy that comes from sharing what you love rather than feeling less unique for the other.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Especially since it&#8217;s the summer now, why not remove the academic workbook framing altogether and just make it about everybody noncompetitively enjoying awesome reading together?   Schedule family quiet reading time where everybody picks their own book, or family group reading time where everybody alternates sentences from a book of a level equally accessible to everyone (or poetry with refrains, parents do verses and kids do refrains).   And take a break from exercises where they perform their proficiency by reading sentences for you or each other.   </p>
<p>Introducing a lot of extrinsic motivation for a self-rewarding activity like reading seems dangerous, anyway, so it might be equally bad for the middle kid if you let him get the idea that reading skills should be scrutinized,  judged and praised by other people.   You wouldn&#8217;t take the family on a hike and have the kids compare who can take bigger strides.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Enjoying reading is a great idea and an ideal priority or focus even for academic reading.</p>
<p>But I think some amount of competitiveness should be expected, even if the kids _agree_ to read together or alone for enjoyment.</p>
<blockquote><p>the idea that reading skills should be scrutinized, judged and praised by other people</p></blockquote>
<p>Do you not think this is true? I think it is. Adults do this to each other, tho the stakes are generally much lower. It&#8217;s not bad in and of itself. I don&#8217;t think it condones being mean to anyone tho, let alone punishing them. I also don&#8217;t think you even have to withhold praise very much, when teaching or otherwise. Praise the effort, not just (or at all) the correct answers.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My youngest son, 9, was at least for a long time physically stronger than my oldest son, 11. My oldest son is also nearly blind in one eye and lacks detailed depth perception as as such cannot sports very well.</p>
<p>My right answer for him was to explain that some people are better than other people at some things, and that some people are even better than some other people in every respect. What his job was, I explained, was to find a thing he&#8217;s particularly good at in local reference to himself and try very hard to be better at it. I then explained that this doesn&#8217;t let him off the hook of the things he&#8217;s bad at; he&#8217;s expected to have a reasonable baseline on those things.</p>
<p>I think the hard thing on this is it was then pretty vital to provide him with a minimum of sympathy about this &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t a big deal, it was something he was reasonable expected to deal with. A request like you mentioned above in the mutual story-reading time where the child asked you to set up a situation in which you would both agree to pretend/ignore the skills the other child had worked for would have been ignored in the me-and-my-son situation. </p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that this is the &#8220;right&#8221; way &#8211; it was for us/him, but kids vary and parents vary. I think it&#8217;s good you are looking for a variety of answers on this.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That&#8217;s a bit different &#8211; both a nurse and a professional artist are specialized; they&#8217;ve chosen a particular thing to focus on, they&#8217;ve usually gone to school for it, etc. There&#8217;s no denying there isn&#8217;t a range of incomes within the &#8220;specialized&#8221; category, and I didn&#8217;t represent there were to him. There are also exceptions &#8211; I know some jack-of-all-trades people who never specialized who make a lot of money and some failures of specialists. But generally I think what I said is true.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t have advice because I&#8217;m not there with my two kids&#8230;. I will probably face a situation like this at some point myself, but my current untested thought is first that if your son is behaving in a way that doesn&#8217;t read the room, this is a good opportunity to help him read the room? I don&#8217;t know how to explain &#8220;yes, you&#8217;re better, but don&#8217;t rub it in people&#8217;s faces&#8221; to a four-year-old though, and also how to do it in a gender-appropriate way&#8230;. I have girls, so my approach to this would probably be different than to a boy, who tend to be competitive. (Lots of boys in my extended family, so I have *some* experience.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yeah, I think a few years really makes a difference for something like that. I can definitely have that sort of conversation with the 6 year old, but couldn&#8217;t really when she was 4. Not sure if any girl vs. boy comes into play too, but at 6 she seems to have a much more intuitive notion of the mental states of others whereas at 4 (for both of them) it was a much higher order almost sort of reasoned approach (e.g. they know A so feel B) which tends to not get easily triggered.  Certainly worth trying to encourage him to be more graceful (he&#8217;s a really sore loser, something we&#8217;re working on to be more graceful in winning and losing).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Early reading is a sign of giftedness (= having an IQ &gt;= 130). I don&#8217;t know how much time you invested in teaching him, but I guess even if he heard most of the lessons you gave his sister, at barely 4 this is still quite an achievement. Gifted children in the classroom are a challenge, but it is always important to remember it is not their fault that they learn some things very fast. </p>
<p>So I think you need to make sure that the needs of both your kids (and the third one) are met. They all deserve your attention equally, so you need to make sure that this is the case. I guess for storytime, this would mean that when they pick a story, they get to read it as much as they like, and you read the rest. And for the danger of your son being a dick about reading, I think it is important to stress that every child has the right to learn at a pace that suits them. So just as it is completely ok that your son reads beyond his age level, it is ok that his sister reads at her age level. Being a dick about that is very mean. </p>
<p>Let me say a little bit more about gifted children. There are two common problems that can arise in their life:<br />
1. They can become bored with school, which can lead to losing interest in school, depression and paradoxically low grades. This might hit your son quite soon &#8211; learning to read is a big part of primary school, and it seems like he will learn that before he even enters primary school. You should monitor closely whether your son is challenged enough, without challenge, he will not learn how to work with effort until it is too late. This is also why you should not hold your son back intellectually.<br />
2. They can get problems in their social life that arise from being different from their peers. This can result in being bullied or being lonely. This is why you should monitor if your son has enough genuine relationships with his peers. </p>
<p>Since intelligence has a huge genetic component, I must ask: How good is your daughter in math exactly?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>You should monitor closely whether your son is challenged enough</p></blockquote>
<p>There are two possibilities here. One, which may not be an option and, if it is, may not be a good idea is to have him skip one or more grades. That raises obvious social problems, and if he is sufficiently bright he still won&#8217;t be challenged in a grade one higher than his age. I wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The other is to find things he likes doing that are intellectually challenging outside of school. That could be chess. It could be programming. It could be reading books intended for adults. It could be arguing politics and philosophy with older kids or adults, or with intellectual peers his own age. But I think it&#8217;s a mistake to think of school as the main thing that will be intellectually challenging for a bright kid. </p>
<p>I spent a number of summers a very long time ago as a councilor at a camp for gifted children. You might see if there is something similar available to you, a place where he will be interacting with kids at his level. That&#8217;s good both for intellectual challenge and a better social environment.</p>
<p>Most of this advice is irrelevant to the current four year old, but will become relevant over the course of the next decade, assuming that Björn is correct in interpreting his early reading as evidence of high intelligence. And relevant to other people here who have or will have bright kids.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Maybe try having the younger child help teach the older, and teach both to learn from each other.</p>
<p>I learned to read early and was probably generally an annoyance in school because it was mostly too easy. But one of my best experiences was helping teach a class, as a student, helping the other students learn. I think the other students liked and appreciated me much more because of that. I wasn&#8217;t just getting more answers correct (or better grades), I was helping them learn and get more answers correct (and better grades) too.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ve been struggling with an issue and the previous <a rel="nofollow"href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/05/28/creationism-unchallenged/">two</a> <a rel="nofollow"href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/05/28/bush-did-north-dakota/">posts</a> sort of &#8220;encouraged&#8221; me to ask: how do I resolve my distrust of news agencies? I have the difficult to articulate impression that there is a large gap between what&#8217;s reported (the <i>focus</i> of the reporting, in particular) and what&#8217;s happening outside of the internet. Given that journalism has a great power to influence many people and &#8220;drive the conversation&#8221;, this perspective on news agencies causes me a lot of anxiety. (My parents grew up in communist Poland so I heard plenty of stories on reporting/reality inconsistencies.) Does anyone else wrestle with these kinds of thoughts?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think my issue centers around your term, &#8220;healthy distrust&#8221;. What if this list contains publications like the &#8220;New York Times&#8221; and &#8220;(My City) Times&#8221;? On one hand I see red flags leading to loss of trust. On the other hand, millions of people read these publications. As a result, I&#8217;m worried that the tinfoil hat in the corner is looking mighty inviting. Perhaps I&#8217;m having trouble separating the wheat from the chaff?</p>

<p>Healthy is &#8220;I&#8217;ve assessed them based on their behavior as I&#8217;ve observed it&#8221;. If you&#8217;ve observed them being untrustworthy and trust them as if they haven&#8217;t for any reason whatsoever, that&#8217;s the part of your trust system that needs fixing.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You can distrust them but still read them occasionally and just treat them with some skepticism. Read a few different sources and synthesize yourself. I think the line into conspiracy territory is when you start seeing them as &#8220;out to get you/misinform&#8221; vs just being people with their own biases and reporting incentives. </p>
<p>Also, basically treat the OpEd section of any large newspaper as essentially a different publication, and maybe avoid it all together, because they&#8217;re usually terrible.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I like having a few small outlets whose bias I understand and consider reliable as a major component of my reading, as opposed to larger outlets who may be more sophisticated in their goals. Larger outlets, I read the WashPo intermittently (and pay for the digital access) and whatever else hits my feeds, but larger outlets prolly make up less than 1/2 of my news. </p>
<p>E.g., I scan through JoeMyGod quite a lot. It&#8217;s written by a gay man who was at the center of a big NYC 80s and 90s gay scene, a guy who saw many, many of his closest friends and really just whole chunks of his social embeddedness sicken and die while Reagan&#8217;s CDC seemed to not care, or even to think it was karmic justice for being gay or out. JoeMyGod has a clear agenda: normalize gayness, mock anti-gay people, provide hub for pro-gay commentary). Sometimes it&#8217;s even quite enjoyable, particularly the mockery of the more ridiculous elements of the tribal right (e.g. he loves calling the Concerned Women of America the Concernstipated Women of America). He continues to be extremely embedded in his network, and quite independent, and a total loudmouth. He won&#8217;t catch every story&#8211;that&#8217;s not what he does at all&#8211;but he&#8217;s trying to talk about the world as he sees it, so his general sense of how the world works bleeds through a good bit. </p>
<p>Another place like that I really like is popehat.com, where a former U.S. prosecutor, who realized prosecutors have way too much power and not nearly enough discretion, and switched to being a for-hire defender. The blog very sadly is defunct (though he still tweets a good storm pretty regularly, and continues to be acerbic and funny). </p>
<p>Others like this&#8230; idiosyncraticwhisk.com (housing market econ), the quora feed of a comp sci prof I had in college (Thomas Cormen), I guess I have a couple dozen things like this that I wheedle through periodically. At the moment, only SSC really gets comments, so I guess I like it here.  </p>
<p>I think your local paper is another good place like this&#8211;it *really* wants to get the details right on things like the high school sports score and the spelling of the names in the obituaries and wedding announcements. </p>
<p>Aside from that, if you want to keep tabs on what everyone else is reading&#8230; a news aggregator with a big subscriber base (e.g. reddit or something) might be better. Not very many people follow one main source anymore, if that was ever a thing, IMHO.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You don&#8217;t ever get to trust publications for one because they can be acting 100% in good faith and still be deceived by their sources or have misinformed staff, for topics you actually care about enough to put in some effort you should compare reporting from different publications with known biases, affiliations and target demographics, hopefully you can avoid outlets that outright fabricate purported facts.</p>

<p>Yes, this is a common experience. Many other people feel the way you&#8217;re feeling. </p>
<p>On a similar note, reading Andrew Gelman during this crisis has not been good for my faith in medical science.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I was thinking recently that I need to be less confident of a lot of my own beliefs because I can&#8217;t always remember exactly which things are actually more likely to be true and which might be as &#8216;true&#8217; as average (or bad) medical science.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that it&#8217;d be nice if Gelman would just a maintain a big list of facts he&#8217;s verified! (I know that&#8217;s ridiculous.)</p>
<p>Maybe I need to blog what I believe and why just so I can remember!</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I struggle with a distrust of news agencies, although for maybe different reasons than you. Sometimes I&#8217;ll just sit back and let the propaganda be pumped into my head, but if I really want to understand something I&#8217;ll look at how ideologically opposed sources report on it and look at the &#8220;raw data&#8221; the articles are based on. </p>
<p>I believe this approach helps me get closer to the truth, and better understand what level of uncertainty I should assign to my conclusions. Personally, I value these outcomes, but they&#8217;re not very practical. </p>
<p>In my situation, having heterodox political opinions (even if carefully explained and well cited) is dangerous to one&#8217;s livelihood. Reports to authorities of even small deviations from the orthodoxy are not uncommon. So yeah, sometimes I wish I could just listen and believe certain news outlets; it would be so easy to participate in conversations about how stupid the other tribe is, but I just can&#8217;t do it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I remember Michael Crichton talking about the accuracy of reporting (and how you notice errors in subjects you know a lot about, but then assume the rest of the paper is accurate) in something I read when I was a teenager and not really giving it much thought, but it stuck with me over the years. When I actually gained some useful knowledge, it started to stick out to me like a sore thumb. Now, everytime I read a news story I automatically think of all the times I&#8217;ve spotted simple errors and it makes me doubt what I&#8217;m reading.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a left wing or right wing thing either. I don&#8217;t even think things like most errors of omission are intentional. I think that unless you are a reporter on one single subject that you know inside and out, it&#8217;s just almost impossible to accurately report a story.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The moment I stopped trusting journalists was when I was reading some guy&#8217;s blog, and he was participating in Occupy Wall Street and describing a 2k+ people tent city, and it was completely absent from the news. My country&#8217;s media? Nope. CNN? Fox? BBC? Literally nobody covered it. I think the coverage started around two days after you&#8217;d expect it to.  The papers weren&#8217;t sure if they are allowed to talk about it.</p>
<p>You can approximate what happened by reading a bunch of completely antagonistic sources with huge bias (e.g. NYT, Al Jazeera, possibly even Russia Today with a huge grain of salt) and interpolating something resembling the truth.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That&#8217;s a major issue&#8211;even if everything the news covers happened exactly as they tell it, they are still choosing what&#8217;s &#8220;newsworthy.&#8221;  For an example, how much coverage did you see of the March for Life in January?  There were well over 100,000 marchers.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Off the top of my head, here are some of the ways the news is necessarily biased, even if coverage of an event is (hypothetically speaking, of course) &#8220;faithful&#8221;/&#8221;truthful&#8221;/etc.:</p>
<p>&#8211; What is covered (what&#8217;s &#8220;newsworthy&#8221;)<br />
&#8211; How much coverage something gets<br />
&#8211; The order in which things are covered<br />
&#8211; Who presents the information<br />
&#8211; What type of verbal, visual, and/or aural language is used to cover something<br />
&#8211; The level of detail, disclosure, or technical sophistication<br />
&#8211; When the content is published</p>
<p>And all these except the last one are at play both within a given news story and across the news in general.</p>
<p>Note that every formal aspect of the news is designed to make you forget or ignore these constraints.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Two days isn&#8217;t long at all, given that 2000 people isn&#8217;t a lot compared to a country of 300 million.  The media covered Occupy Wall Street extensively after that.  I&#8217;m sure there are many events that the media should cover yet don&#8217;t, but OWS is not one of them.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think you have mistaken the point that &#8220;a real dog&#8221; is making.  It&#8217;s not that OWS wasn&#8217;t (eventually) covered adequately, but that this was when he first observed an undeniable intentional delay in coverage.  This can be taken as evidence that the media is not simply reporting what is happening, but is consciously and collectively deciding which events to cover, and how they should be be covered. It implies that there are probably events (or aspects of events) that unlike OWS are simply never reported.  The point is not how the short delay in coverage affected the perception of OWS, but the realization that the media is consciously sculpting a narrative and deciding what to cover (and how to cover it) based on how it affects that narrative.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You can <i>resolve</i> your distrust by remembering that the news is just a show put on by people who majored in stuff like English and Acting, in which they pretend to be authoritative gatekeepers of truth and matters of importance.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That&#8217;s an exaggeration. What is in the news has some relation to what is happening.</p>
<p>One way of getting a more accurate picture is by remembering that the consistent bias is in favor of telling a good story.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s true that the news has more relevance to real world events than scripted dramas, in the same way &#8220;Tiger King&#8221; or &#8220;America&#8217;s Funniest Home Videos&#8221; do. The people who make the show (mostly) don&#8217;t script and produce the actual events depicted/discussed in the show, but they decide what to depict and how to depict it, and they use any number of techniques to depict it in different ways.</p>
<p>This is as true for print as it is for radio, television, and web journalism, even though my examples were two TV shows.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t an exaggeration to say that the news is, at the end of the day, another form of entertainment alongside all other media people consume for fun &#8212; sitcoms, fiction novels, fashion magazines, gamer vlogs, etc. &#8212; and that it deserves no more trust than any of these.</p>
<p>Certainly not in the way someone might &#8220;trust&#8221; things like the judicial system, the speedometer in his car, what his physical therapist recommends when it comes to exercises, what the MLB website says the score of last night&#8217;s baseball game was, etc.</p>

<p>Again with this obsession. As if engineering majors don&#8217;t have their own all-encompassing biases distorting their views of how the world works.</p>
<p>Though I do think we&#8217;d be better off with more reporters who didn&#8217;t go to college at all, the crusty hard-drinking working-class types who only exist in old movies, if they ever did.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That&#8217;s not fair calling it an obsession. Seems like an ad hominem, like I&#8217;m crazed or something. It&#8217;s a hobby horse of mine for sure and I harp on it consistently when it gets brought up, but it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m staying up at night grinding my teeth thinking about what a big charade journalism is. (OK, I&#8217;ve done that once or twice. But that&#8217;s it, and it was a while ago!)</p>
<p>Yes, people who major in anything, as well as those who major in nothing, all have biases. And I don&#8217;t even care about credentials, really. The point when I say &#8220;English and Acting majors&#8221; is that journalists are people whose only particular skill is in crafting narratives on tight deadlines, yet they present themselves as authorities on what is both true and important to know about, who are supposed to have some kind of special status as a result.</p>
<p>Most of the journalists I&#8217;ve encountered in real life are exactly the drinking, rumpled types you describe. As I said in a previous thread, journalism is a tough industry that doesn&#8217;t pay well, and those who survive in it are pretty road-hardened. But it doesn&#8217;t change what journalism is at its core.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Don&#8217;t try to resolve your distrust of news agencies. They ARE all biased and present skewed visions of reality, though some of them are worse than others. The best advice I can give you is to get your news from multiple sources from across the ideological spectrum, pay attention to how they cover the same events differently and to which events are ignored by some agencies but not others, and to use your judgement to determine what is actually happening. It takes time and mental energy, which most adults lack, which is why so many people are biased and ill-informed. There are no shortcuts or easy answers.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I get the impression too that the protests are dying down a bit.  Here is a website that has live updates on what&#8217;s going on today:  <a rel="nofollow"href="https://usprotests.liveuamap.com/" rel="nofollow ugc">US Protests Live map</a>.  Protesting every day is exhausting, and people probably have personal responsibilities that they can put off for only so long.  They may flare up again next weekend. </p>
<p>It reminds me of that passage in <a rel="nofollow"href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/9.html" rel="nofollow ugc">Homage to Catalonia</a> that describes the May 1937 civil strife between anarchists and communists in Barcelona dying down:</p>
<blockquote><p>I spent that final night on the roof, and the next day it did really look as<br />
though the fighting was coming to an end. I do not think there was much firing<br />
that day&#8211;the Friday. No one seemed to know for certain whether the troops from<br />
Valencia were really coining; they arrived that evening, as a matter of fact.<br />
The Government was broadcasting half-soothing, half-threatening messages, asking<br />
everyone to go home and saying that after a certain hour anyone found carrying<br />
arms would be arrested. Not much attention was paid to the Government&#8217;s<br />
broadcasts, but everywhere the people were fading away from the barricades. I<br />
have no doubt that it was mainly the food shortage that was responsible. From<br />
every side you heard the same remark:&#8217; We have no more food, we must go back to<br />
work.&#8217; On the other hand the Civil Guards, who could count on getting their<br />
rations so long as there was any food in the town, were able to stay at their<br />
posts. By the afternoon the streets were almost normal, though the deserted<br />
barricades were still standing; the Ramblas were thronged with people, the shops<br />
nearly all open, and&#8211;most reassuring of all&#8211;the trams that had stood so long<br />
in frozen blocks jerked into motion and began running. The Civil Guards were<br />
still holding the Cafe Moka and had not taken down their barricades, but some of<br />
them brought chairs out and sat on the pavement with their rifles across their<br />
knees. I winked at one of them as I went past and got a not unfriendly grin; he<br />
recognized me, of course. Over the Telephone Exchange the Anarchist flag had<br />
been hauled down and only the Catalan flag was flying. That meant that the<br />
workers were definitely beaten; I realized&#8211;though, owing to my political<br />
ignorance, not so clearly as I ought to have done&#8211;that when the Government<br />
felt more sure of itself there would be reprisals. But at the time I was not<br />
interested in that aspect of things. All I felt was a profound relief that the<br />
devilish din of firing was over, and that one could buy some food and have a bit<br />
of rest and peace before going back to the front.</p></blockquote>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Which Science Fiction media has the best music?</p>
<p>For the classic properties, I actually rank the Alexander Courage TOS theme over Star Wars. It does a few slightly more interesting things with the melody, which really hammers in that &#8220;weirdness in the unexplored&#8221; sense, which is at the core of Sci-fi.<br />
However, Star Wars is still a juggernaut, because John Williams is truly the man.<br />
I found the TNG theme to be a little too conventional. It&#8217;s a theme that could be applied to a non-genre setting, while not being quite as epic genius as Star Wars to make up for that. The Halo theme is actually more interesting, in that sense.<br />
I am not familiar with the other Trek themes.<br />
I initially liked the reboot Trek theme by Giacchino, but it turned out to be empty calories. Lack of rhythm means that it doesn&#8217;t hold up outside of a very narrow range of orchestration, and it&#8217;s damning that one always gets a thrill when they return to teasing at the Courage theme.</p>
<p>It might be cheating, but I also put Yoko Kanno&#8217;s work (Cowboy Bebop and GITS:SAC) in the top tier. Kenji Kawai&#8217;s work was good, probably better than some Trek themes, but also isn&#8217;t really sci-fi on its own. Its power comes from the juxtaposition of the traditional with the imagery it&#8217;s accompanying. </p>
<p>The Fifth Element gets some novelty points, but also cheated by using proven opera masterpiece. It&#8217;s basically an insert song remix.</p>
<p>I have zero memory for any themes from Blade Runner or The Matrix.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>One that I only recently discovered thanks to Netflix was the soundtrack for Evangelion. The story is interesting, albeit very confusing on a first watch, but the music really sticks with you long afterwards. It&#8217;s really good at capturing alien horror, and also has some of the best combat themes I&#8217;ve heard anywhere.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> reboot had some great music, especially the opening mini-series. I also like the music for <i>Blade Runner 2049</i> (Denis Villeneuve knows how to choose his composers).</p>
<p>You got me thinking of the first two seasons of <i>Lost in Space</i> (1965-1967), which had an absolutely terrible opening theme by John Williams. He must have known how bad it was, since he wrote a new theme for season 3.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>However, Star Wars is still a juggernaut, because John Williams is truly the man.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Duel of the Fates&#8221; is the height of music for SF/fantasy media. For the OT, he turned in straight instrumental Classical, which was well-executed but, well, you could have the Germans in WWI marching to the Imperial March. Gregorian chants in Sanskrit was a conceptually brilliant way to say &#8220;this place is culturally alien.&#8221;<br />

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My ranking of Trek opening themes from best to worst is:</p>
<p>Voyager &gt; DS9 (first few seasons) &gt; TOS &gt; TNG &gt; DS9 (later seasons) &gt; Discovery &gt;&gt; Enterprise. </p>
<p>Picard kind of stands off to one side- it&#8217;s very good for what it&#8217;s trying to be, but doesn&#8217;t feel like a Trek theme. The Discovery theme <i>is</i> trying to be a Trek theme, but would fit better with a documentary about Trek.</p>
<p>Seconding nuBSG, 2001 and Star Wars. In particular, Duel of the Fates is the best thing about the prequel trilogy.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>+1 for Yoko Kanno, she&#8217;s probably the most versatile composer for sci-fi media and Cowbooy Bebop is her masterpiece. In the same series she ranges from <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2rVnRwW0h8" rel="nofollow ugc">Tank!</a> to <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyI635o2pmk" rel="nofollow ugc">The Real Folk Blues</a> to <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03qBqP2I4p8" rel="nofollow ugc">Blue</a> and so on.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d also mention Nobuo Uematsu for his work on Square Enix games, notably the Final Fantasy series.</p>
<p>As for Western composers, John Williams wins hands down for Imperial March, Cantina theme and Duel of the Fates. Star Wars theme and Return of the Jedi theme are ok, all the other stuff from the prequels and the Disney trilogy is completely forgettable.</p>

<p>There are plenty of Japanese composers that I adore, including Uematsu, but this thread was specifically for sci-fi, though.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>+1 for TOS over TNG. The TNG theme weirdly fails to fit the tone of the show&#8211; it feels more triumphalist/martial than TOS which is the opposite of the direction they took the storytelling. In this sense I think Giacchino&#8217;s reboot theme hit the mark well&#8211; it captures some of the wonder/mystery feel of TOS while adding in more overt action/adventure elements, which is exactly what the movies did too.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t quite sci-fi in the classic sense, but the score for <i>Gravity</i> won a well-deserved Oscar.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I would have to give the nod to Star Wars just because of how timeless it has become. Dual of the Fates is also quite good.<br />
That said, I think that Blade Runner&#8217;s music might be the best match of music to film ever. So much of what I love about that movie is because of its ambiance, and the music fits perfectly. As great as Star Wars&#8217; soundtrack is, I think it would have been a great soundtrack for many different kinds of movie.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll have to take your word for it. In Argentina in the late 80s and the 90s the Blade Runner theme was used as the theme music for <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbb7VKyjTnU" rel="nofollow ugc">the weekly summary of soccer matches TV show</a>. This became the earliest association with this music for me and other kids of my generation, so later when we saw the movie the reaction would forever be &#8220;why is soccer music playing now in this sci-fi movie?&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Not sure what the numbers are but aren&#8217;t transmission rates much lower in open areas than in indoors? Most of the rioting activity is outside. Though, this is balanced by the fact that there are many protestors in dense groups. Plus, rioters in particular have two reasons to wear masks.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Not sure what the numbers are but aren’t transmission rates much lower in open areas than in indoors?</p></blockquote>
<p>I think that&#8217;s mostly because open areas typically give people a chance to spread out more than they do indoors.  Possibly with a side order of sunlight acting as a disinfectant, but I saw a lot of rioting happening well after sunset last night.</p>
<p>The biggest risk factors seem to be crowding and noise, and riots have plenty of both. I do not think improvised masks are going to save these people.  Youth, will save almost all of them from actually dying &#8211; bringing SARS CoV-2 home to their less youthful relatives, that might be a big problem.</p>

<p>I was told by someone who should know what he is talking about (and what to say in public), that an important part of being outside is that the virus concentration will get diluted much faster.</p>
<p>That on the other hand might get offset when a lot of people standing close together and chanting protests slogans.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>+1, +2 on the cities.  I think we&#8217;ve mostly hammered it into geek consciousness at least that you have to study <i>some</i> logistics if you don&#8217;t want to sound like a complete noob when you talk about all the warfighting in your favorite genre entertainment.  The logistics of cities is an equally fascinating subject, that gets far less attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;If X people and animals live here, what do they eat?&#8221; is always a good genre fiction question.<br />
According to Michael Mornard, a guy who was playing in the original <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> campaigns at time of publication, people were already raising that question about vast, lightless underground settlements. Apparently the answer was &#8220;McDonalds.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>So since the geocentric model of the universe was based on Aristotle&#8217;s Physics, where things in the air or aether fall not because of gravity as we understand it, but because everything falls to the center of the Earth/universe unless buoyant liquid or a solid surface is in the way, the Moon and planets would have to be either useless spheres embedded in their crystal spheres or possibly-inhabited flat dirt spots on the otherwise clean and transparent spheres, right?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My understanding is that the Aristotelian system (or at least, later versions of it) had the idea that every substance has a proper motion. The principle of earth had a proper motion that moved downwards to the center, while the principle of water is a proper motion to move downwards unless stopped by earth. The principle of fire had a proper motion to ascend upwards. I&#8217;m not exactly sure what the proper motion of air was, but it was less downwards than water and less upwards than fire.</p>
<p>These four principles only govern the sublunary objects that are inside the central crystal sphere. Beyond the crystal sphere, everything is made of a quintessence/fifth element, that has its own proper motion of moving in a circle around the four other elements. I think they considered the stars and planets to be perfect spheres made of this quintessence, though it&#8217;s possible that they thought of them as spherical impurities suspended inside a transparent crystal sphere that itself did the rotation.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I think this paper is a good look at the parts of Aristotelian physics that don&#8217;t depend on an outdated theory of the elements. It turns out to have Newtonian physics as a limiting case where you assume zero friction motion in a vacuum: <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-american-philosophical-association/article/aristotles-physics-a-physicists-look/60964532EE56BA65655971A314FD9717" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-american-philosophical-association/article/aristotles-physics-a-physicists-look/60964532EE56BA65655971A314FD9717</a></p>

<p>I think an easier way for moderns to conceptualize it is to think of it as layers of density. Just like how in a beaker sediment, water, and oil will separate into layers, so too the four elements separate themselves into layers based on &#8220;purity.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I thought this was interesting.  Apparently, police shootings have gone down in urban areas over the last years, but increased in rural and suburban areas, with the net result being little change.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow"href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-are-killing-fewer-people-in-big-cities-but-more-in-suburban-and-rural-america/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-are-killing-fewer-people-in-big-cities-but-more-in-suburban-and-rural-america/</a></p>
<p>538 ascribes these changes to different policies on police response, but conspicuously absent is any correlation or comparison to crime rates.  Given the stereotype of rural laid-off coal miners and opioid crises, I would suspect declining socioeconomics could lead to an increase in crime, and thus more police response &#8211; in other words, shootings correlate with the quantity and not (solely) the quality of police work.  So while crime rates overall has a strong downward trend, I also find the claim that rural crime has reached its highest level in a decade:</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think there&#8217;s a case to be made that crime is increasing in rural areas. In general, where there is decay, there is probably crime and chaos of all varieties. I&#8217;d bet that the drugs are a major part of it. Also demographic change might also contribute.<br />
Further, I remember reading about how in rural areas you might see such things as looting of copper wire and church bells, which @ana53294 has described in these open threads in Spain, but also is a problem <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.latimes.com/local/la-xpm-2012-aug-21-la-me-metal-theft-20120822-story.html" rel="nofollow ugc">throughout California</a>, including its rural central valley, or a <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.city-journal.org/html/do-we-want-mexifornia-12236.html" rel="nofollow ugc">right-wing but local source. </a></p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That matches my anecdotal experience growing up in a rural California town. Definitely feels less safe than it used to, mostly from increased drug use and a lack of good work. I also think it&#8217;s enforced by a cycle wherin the town is seen as &#8220;dead-end&#8221; so motivated kids work hard in school to go to uni, then leave and move to the city. That leaves behind mostly dropouts and people who didn&#8217;t have the motivation to leave the town as the main youth population. It&#8217;s a brain/motivation drain that sucks people out of smaller towns and into larger cities, making the smaller towns seem more dead end, making more people who are able to leave, want to leave.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t put together stats, but of my highschool graduating class (2015) the number of people who are already parents, often single, is wildly higher among those who stayed in the town. Same for people in my graduating class who&#8217;ve died of overdoses. As far as I&#8217;m aware literally all of them were people who stayed in the town after graduating high school.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Question for Scott about the Book Review Contest:</p>
<p>Is it OK to submit a dual review of a book that propounded a thesis and another book that challenged it? This is mostly a formatting question, since I&#8217;ll try to discuss the substance of the controversy in any case, but I want to avoid possible anchoring bias that might occur as a result of presenting a review of one book and potentially implying that it&#8217;s the more important one.</p>
<p>(The books are <i>Retreat From Doomsday</i> and <i>Only the Dead</i> and the thesis is that major war has declined.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Magic Rules Update:</p>
<p>1. Companions have been re-worked. Now, instead of just being in your hand from the start, you have pay three mana to bring them in from your sideboard into your hand. As far as I can tell, this means that the &#8220;companion zone&#8221; is not a thing anymore. This effectively adds three mana to the costs of all companions, although you can pay that over two turns. I&#8217;m not sure what the effect of this will be&#8230; three mana to draw a card is below rate, but not horrible, especially if you are guaranteed to draw a powerful and known card. </p>
<p>2. Fires of Invention is banned &#8211; good. Card was broken from the beginning; shouldn&#8217;t have seen the light of day. Too vulnerable to shenanigans. </p>
<p>3. Agent of Treachery is banned &#8211; F-ing finally. I hated this card even before all the recent additions made him trivial to get onto the battlefield. Good riddance to bad rubbish. </p>
<p>Overall, I&#8217;m interested to see what will happen. My first guess is that we&#8217;ll see more Temur Reclamation decks running around; that was the only tier-1 deck that didn&#8217;t really rely on companions OR fires/agent. Maybe mid-range will make a comback? With agent gone we can go back to having permenants in play.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Well Obosh and Gyruda are dead &#8211; Lurus probably still gets played main deck in some stuff, but I don&#8217;t think the restriction + the mana is good enough &#8211; except maybe in cycling.<br />
Yorion seems like the one where you might still find 3 mana for a card and the deck-building restriction worth it.<br />
I think rakdos/jund sacrifice and cycling are still good too and we&#8217;ll definitely still see some kind of u/w control.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yorion stood out for me as the biggest winner among the losers as well. That deck routinely has 3 extra mana&#8230; although I forgot to mention also that the companions can only be brought back at sorcery speed which maybe even that deck doesn&#8217;t want to do. </p>
<blockquote><p>I think rakdos/jund sacrifice and cycling are still good too and we’ll definitely still see some kind of u/w control.

<p>I had honestly blocked these from my head. Yeah, I think the cat machine will keep on ticking along and cyclings as good as it ever was.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Wow, they went ahead and power-level-errata&#8217;ed Companion. I didn&#8217;t expect that, and it sets a scary precedent, but it&#8217;s probably the right fix from a gameplay perspective. 3 mana seems a little excessive; I&#8217;d have liked to see it at 2 mana but I can understand that they weren&#8217;t willing to risk it not being enough. Given that attitude toward risk I&#8217;d expect that companions see near-zero tier 1 play going forward, except maybe for the occasional Companion that&#8217;s just played for incremental value rather than having the deck built around it. That makes me sad because it&#8217;s the opposite of what Companions were designed to do.</p>
<p>Overall Magic seems to be taking a more aggressive attitude toward experimentation recently, which is really interesting. I can think of 3 possible reasons for it:<br />
1. There&#8217;s increased business pressure to sell cards in the short term, which given the popularity of non-rotating formats means ramping up card desirability; being experimental is a way to print highly desirable cards without outraging the customer base too much.<br />
2. There&#8217;s concern over the long-term health of the game and the experimentation is an attempt to find fruitful design ideas that will keep it dynamic.<br />
3. The online Arena platform makes it easier and more rewarding to &#8220;move fast and break things&#8221; relative to paper Magic.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Mark Rosewater&#8217;s claiming that it&#8217;s mostly point 2 &#8211; they are deliberately changing their philosophy more towards big, splashy stuff that they might have to ban over relatively safe but boring stuff. </p>
<p>I personally think 3 is also a big factor as well though. It&#8217;s objectively easier and less disruptive to change rules in digital than it is paper; I personally see this as a potential indicator that paper magic is becoming less of the main focus and the real time/developer effort is shifting towards arena.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Maybe they should start re-releasing some of the early sets &#8212; the ones before Modern, or maybe pre-Pioneer. Just tweak them a bit based on accumulated experience. Should be much cheaper than designing from scratch, and most of the grognards who played those sets the first time around will be gone anyway.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That&#8217;s similar to &#8216;Masters&#8217; sets, which, quibbles about pricing aside, usually play pretty darn well.<br />
Just re-releasing some old expansion set verbatim would not necessarily be an improvement, since a lot of cards back then were overly complex or pointlessly bad.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Also, they’ve had twenty years to pick the low hanging fruit. New ideas are probably going to be either weird or boring at this point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I kinda disagree &#8211; I mean, look at mutate. It&#8217;s a great mechanic, provides interesting choices for the player, has a bunch of levers that R&amp;D could tune to adjust power levels (IE by increasing the on-mutate effect or the new creature&#8217;s power level). It also really worked from a flavor perspective and isn&#8217;t, IMO, especially weird. </p>
<p>And that&#8217;s just from this set. Skipping Theros, which for some reason I don&#8217;t remember, Eldraine brought us Adventure which is one of my favorite mechanics ever. Again, interesting decisions, super tunable and really cool from a flavor standpoint without being overly complex.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Mutate isn&#8217;t any weirder than Bestow, but it is pretty weird and has a lot of confusing corner case interactions you probably would rather not risk in a fresher game with plenty of design space.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s just like an aura, since it doesn&#8217;t fizzle if the target creature dies in response. But it doesn&#8217;t stay on the field like bestow. It&#8217;s basically an enchantment but doesn&#8217;t count as such. And it makes clones a real head ache. Blinking and reanimating it work as the rules would predict, but not intuitively. </p>
<p>Adventure cards are just a bit weirder than split or aftermath (because they mess around with exile), but those are also kind of weird, two little cards in one. There&#8217;s lots of edge cases around anything that cares about converted mana costs or countering a specific type of spell, say. It&#8217;s not hard to grok, and they are kind of cool, but certainly an example of experimentation. </p>
<p>I think a good rebuttal to my point would be that this kind of experimentation has been going on for some time, and isn&#8217;t related to recent power level spikes, which have been on an upswing, non-linear but with a positive slope, since about, what, Smuggler&#8217;s Copter?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>How is 3 mana for +1 card below rate? isn&#8217;t 2U the standard cost for a draw 2 sorcery? So 3 generic mana is great value as long as the companion is better than what you&#8217;d get on average from your deck (which is easy given that there are &gt;1/3 lands in there).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t think there is a single deck in standard playing divination, or even Of One Mind, which is probably closer to 1u in effective cost. It can be the normal cost and still be below rate; 2U is balanced for limited, just like a bear is, and I think it&#8217;d be fair to say grizzly bears is below rate (for basically all colors at this point).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s part of why I think Yorion is still pretty decent &#8211; a control deck is much more likely to want a free divination then an aggro deck.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Fair enough on the power level of divination, but I was trying to factor in the high option value that this effect grants. Sure, divination is sub-par, but a divination has opportunity costs: awkward mulligans, being down 1 card until you play it, the danger of drawing too much card draw, etc. This effect doesn&#8217;t have any of those downsides. It&#8217;s basically not there at all until the exact moment you want to use it. If we weren&#8217;t comparing against the previous companion mechanic which was absolutely bonkers, this would be considered strong, specially for a control deck.</p>
<p>By the way, I&#8217;m not an active player, so I&#8217;m reasoning from first principles rather than the state of the current meta.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yup, that&#8217;s fair &#8211; I think your estimate of &#8220;draw a card, put your companion into your hand&#8221; being slightly better then divination is true &#8211; so the question becomes, how far would you change your deck for a free divination in your starting hand. </p>
<p>It makes them less powerful, but also makes the aggro/tempo ones relatively less powerful compared to the control ones.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yeah, what Itowel said. Look at what it&#8217;s competing with in standard. </p>
<p>1U gets you Omen of the sea a flash scry 2, draw 1.</p>
<p>1UU get&#8217;s you narset, which lets you filter through 10 card, pick 2 of them and locks down your opponent&#8217;s ability to gain card advantage. </p>
<p>1WU gets you 3feri which helps you stabalize and serves as repeatable card draw. </p>
<p>1UG gets you Uro, which draw and ramps and gains life. </p>
<p>I know I&#8217;m comparing generic to colored mana, but still &#8211; what turn do you want to spend 3 mana on your main phase doing basically nothing? Turn 6 or 7 maybe?</p>

<p>Sure. Fair, but feelbad. I still hated it. That being said, when was the last time you saw a deck that was actually trying to cast Agent for 7 instead of either warping him up with either Winota or Lukka or whatever?</p>
<p>ETA &#8211; and sure he can be &#8220;fair&#8221; at 7, but not when Thassa&#8217;s flashing him every turn.</p>

<p>Two reasons:</p>
<p>1st, if you do a Gyruda combo, you just did a super cool thing. If you do an Agent combo, you just stole my cool thing. Having your stuff stolen feels way worse than &#8220;I did awesome, he just out awesome-ed me&#8221;.</p>
<p>2nd, with Gyruda or boardwipes or whatever, there&#8217;s usually some comeback potential. Maybe I had an Anax and still have a bunch of tokens after a boardwipe, maybe I&#8217;ve got deathtouch or fliers or something where I can weasel out a win. Epic comebacks are rare but awesome. With Agent, you just stole whatever I was going to use for my comeback. </p>
<p>Being stolen from inherently sucks and deprives you of comeback resources.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Don’t see how Agent is less fun than a boardwipe or a Gyruda.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Three play scenarios:</p>
<p>1. I have a cool nonland permanent in play. Agent comes out and takes it unless I have a counter spell. I now get to experience the un-fun feeling of getting beaten to death with my own thing. That feels bad. </p>
<p>2. I have several nonland permanents in play. Maybe a few small creatures and a planeswalker. Agent comes out, takes the best one, then gets flashed a bunch and takes the rest. I now get beaten to death with my own things. That feels bad.</p>
<p>3. I have no nonland permenants in play. Agent comes out and takes my mana, then gets flashed and takes another mana. Now I&#8217;m down 2 mana and since agent is getting flashed every turn, I can never go up mana again. This feels really bad especially since now I have to face 10 turns of a 2/3 beating me to death. </p>
<p>These just aren&#8217;t fun. Losing to a deck that doesn&#8217;t play any wincons because it knows it can kill you with yours feels worse than getting your board wiped or combo-d out. At least to me.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>This effectively adds three mana to the costs of all companions, although you can pay that over two turns. I’m not sure what the effect of this will be… three mana to draw a card is below rate, but not horrible, especially if you are guaranteed to draw a powerful and known card.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder if we&#8217;ll see decks with 4 copies + companion. Eg, a Gyruda deck with 4 Gyruda&#8217;s plus Gyruda companion. That way you can run the Gyruda combo and if you miss your Gyruda draw on turn 4 you can still grab Gyruda from the companion zone. Yeah, it slows you down a turn, but as a fail case that&#8217;s not bad.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been running a cycling deck with Lurus and I really like him, I kinda want to run 4, but ironically you can&#8217;t have Lurus in your deck if you have a Lurus companion.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Since approximately the same time as the change to the blogroll headers, I&#8217;ve noticed a layout change, at least with Safari 11.0.1, that&#8217;s very much not an improvement.

<p>The natural result is that I don&#8217;t see the side bar at all, and don&#8217;t notice any new posts until I receive them as part of my RSS feed, which does not include &#8220;hidden&#8221; OT threads.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Thank you so much. </p>
<p>The way Safari decides what size to use for a new window is basically to pick the size of <i>one</i> of the windows the user has open. I&#8217;ve never been able to determine which one it picks; but the result is weird behaviour if you have windows of multiple sizes. I probably resized something else, and when I next went back to SSC, Safari decided I wanted it the same width &#8211; which was close enough to normal that I didn&#8217;t notice. (Alternatively, there was a change to the layout, making the needed size wider. But unless others are reporting this, I&#8217;m happy to blame Safari itself.) </p>
<p>Resizing the Safari window fixed the problem.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>As 10240 says, this depends on the width of the browser window.  But at least with Safari 13.1, it also depends on the text size.  If you decrease the text size (Cmd -, or View-&gt;Zoom Out) you will probably see the side bar reappear.  Unfortunately, depending on your visual acuity, this it will likely reappear just about the point that the text becomes slightly too small to read comfortably!</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>New blogroll arrangement seems nice. Pity that <a rel="nofollow"href="esr.ibiblio.org" rel="nofollow ugc">Eric S Raymond</a> has dropped off it, though. His blog is actively updated and often has rationality-related posts (e.g. <a rel="nofollow"href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8680" rel="nofollow ugc">here</a> and <a rel="nofollow"href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8657" rel="nofollow ugc">here</a>). For the rest&#8230; well, not wanting to get into CW territory, I&#8217;ll just say that he has a Nassim-Taleb-like knack for being controversial on almost every topic and plausibly right on a large enough fraction of them to be worth reading.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If the universe is a simulation, why would the Implementers make gravity work the way it does? It seems really computationally difficult to simulate, having every mass exert a force on every other mass. I feel like most of the rest of physics, as we understand them so far, aren&#8217;t too challenging to simulate, but gravity really sticks out.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>This seems like a great argument for general relativity. In Newtonian physics, you have to worry about every mass acting on every other mass, but in Einsteinian physics, each mass just deforms space, a single universal field, and then other masses behave according to the local shape of space.</p>
<p>I think your question can probably be turned around, and you could argue that relativity supports the simulation hypothesis, because it&#8217;s much more computationally efficient, I think it&#8217;d be O(n) instead of O(n^2)?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t think this follows. Computing some aspect of the field everywhere would be O(n*m), where n is the number of objects affecting any point and m is the number of places you want to know the curvature of spacetime. And I assume m needs to be greater than n because you <i>at least</i> need the curvature everywhere there&#8217;s a mass.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Perhaps a relevant caveat that I&#8217;m a *very* mediocre programmer.</p>
<p>The way I&#8217;m picturing it, you have some field &#8220;space&#8221;, and then you have your array of particles. In Newtonian physics, you have to compute the force between every pair of particles. In the einsteinian version, you just have to run through the particle list twice, once to set your space shape, and once to compute your forces.</p>
<p>I think you&#8217;re saying that you need such a high resolution on the space field that you end up worse off? I guess I could see that, but it seems like since the influence of a mass on space is continuous and linear (in the linear algebra sense), you don&#8217;t actually have to compute every point. You&#8217;d have some existing solution that&#8217;s &#8220;how much space deforms at every point due to a point mass&#8221;, and then you just superimpose a bunch of those. </p>
<p>I guess this trades computational steps for memory? Maybe that doesn&#8217;t make you any better off, but it does seem like this should just be O(n) in space even if not in time.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>But when you&#8217;re setting your space shape, isn&#8217;t it m*n^3? You do a pass over each mass (m), and then have to update every point in space (n^3).</p>
<p>Or if you use your approach of &#8220;that&#8217;s how much space deforms at every point&#8230;&#8221;, that&#8217;s back to the m^2 complexity.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yeah you still have to deal with all of space. I&#8217;m imagining that you already have to deal with all of space for lots of purposes anyway though. The specific concern that gravity is inefficient because it happens between every pair of masses no longer applies in general relativity, because gravity is masses impacting and being impacted by a universal field. </p>
<p>If storing all of space is a problem then you probably aren&#8217;t simulating a universe anyway. I agree there are other coefficients in the O(C*m) behavior, but at least in terms of number of particles, it should be possible to be linear in that.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The problem is that each point in space is basically now another particle whose motion you have to keep track of.</p>
<p>That is, you&#8217;re way oversimplifying the step &#8220;[run through the particles] to set your space shape.&#8221; The Einstein gravitational field is not only influenced by the objects in it but also by itself. So if before you had n particles and O(n^2) work to do you now have n particles plus m points in space where m must be much larger than n for any hope of accuracy, and the step where you update space goes like O(m^??).</p>
<p>Think of it this way: is it easier to simulate the effect of ships&#8217; wakes on each other by using a simple formula to approximate the wake a ship by itself generates and doing the O(n^2) algorithm OR by realistically simulating the fluid dynamics of the waves in between the ships?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@smocc I had forgotten that curvature of space can curve space further, that probably does throw a bigger wrench in things.</p>
<p>As far as the ship analogy, I think the &#8220;simulate the ocean&#8221; angle makes more sense in a context of the simulation being about the whole ocean anyway. It was never about influence of ships on ships, it was about the whole ocean in the first place, so this is only relevant to the question of how the ships interact with the ocean. Once you&#8217;re simulating the whole ocean anyway, treating ships as perturbers of the ocean instead of interacting particles seems likely to be simpler.</p>
<p>Also, my understanding is solving gravitational warping of space is *much* easier than solving turbulence. That we can add the influence of individual particles to eachother. If that&#8217;s just a low-energy approximation then perhaps it isn&#8217;t true, but I was picturing the actual computational step from each particle to be the same and therefore much easier to scan across every particle (since you basically have a single matrix of the effect of a point mass, which you then add to various points in space).</p>
<p>But yeah I may be oversimplifying gravity too much.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@smocc: But field theories are local, so (assuming a discretization) the field value at point x at time t is only determined by the field values at the that point and a few points in the neighborhood of x at time t &#8211; 1. By contrast, Newton&#8217;s Law is non-local, so you really need to keep track of all the particles in the universe to find the force on one of them at a given time.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Alejandro </p>
<p>Yes, the theory is local, which means doing the wave propagation at each time step is O(m) rather than O(m^2). The downside is that now your model accuracy depends on the resolution of your spatial points. While your computation time may be O(m) your error is bounded from below by something like 1/m, (details depend on the kind of interaction).</p>
<p>And the real pisser is that you can&#8217;t ignore any of the m space points unless you&#8217;re really sure  they don&#8217;t matter. When x and y aren&#8217;t neighbors you can&#8217;t tell a priori whether or not what&#8217;s happening at point x matters to point y without doing the simulation to tell.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@drunkfish The original question why simulators who have a choice would choose the gravitational field model over the Newtonian model. In the Newtonian model the question is &#8220;what is every single particle in the universe doing right now&#8221; and in the field model the question is &#8220;what is every single particle in the universe plus every single point in space doing right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The second question is just harder and if you could get away with only asking about the dynamics of the particles it would be easier.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If you&#8217;re going to try to calculate the curvature of all of space, then that&#8217;s exactly as much work as calculating the (Newtonian) gravitational field vector at every point. And then that&#8217;s the acceleration of any particle at that point.</p>
<p>Of course calculating this for all of space is incredibly wasteful because most of space is empty.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I just feel the need to point out that there is a gravitational field in newtonian physics which can be described by a scalar potential. The equation for this potential is very simple, laplacian V = rho. In vacuum (most of space) rho=0.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That the laws of physics seem to be simple is something I&#8217;m curious about, particularly in combination with the idea of Tegmarkian multiverses. I&#8217;m confused in two spots.</p>
<p>First, why so little? Four forces, 17 particles, maybe double it for dark matter, between 3 + 1 and 11 dimensions? Why is the program so short? Appealing to Kolmogorov complexity doesn&#8217;t get you out of this. Yes, shorter programs are fundamentally more likely for any given phenomenon. But a randomly selected universe out of all possible Tegmarkian universes should have an <i>infinite</i> program length! Is it possible that most of the entities simply don&#8217;t interact? That is, not only is there dark matter and dark energy, but there is also super dark entities, which doesn&#8217;t even interact with gravity. Maybe most of the universe is such boring entities, and we simply happen to be playing in a rare tidepool of a handful of laws that interact in complicated enough ways to support life.</p>
<p>The other thing that confuses me is where the complexity is spent. Even if we assume the program length isn&#8217;t weird, the division of complexity seems weird. We have, at most it seems, a few kB of physical laws. But there are 10^80 particles! In a database, this wouldn&#8217;t be too unusual, but that is because databases were designed like that. As far as a Tegmarkian universe is concerned, the number describing how many particles there are (or really, how much energy there was in the initial conditions) is just another number. </p>
<p>Thinking about it, it might not be that weird? If we assume the fundamental particles aren&#8217;t stored individually, the actual amount of program length to store the initial energy is something like log2(10^80), that might mean that most physical laws in the observable universe should be close in length to that, otherwise the number of bits dedicated to the initial conditions would be weirdly long or weirdly short. Or the initial conditions are anthropically biased in different ways, and this isn&#8217;t valid.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>When people do simulations of galaxy formation, they generally use a newtonian framework because it&#8217;s easier to simulate and sufficiently accurate.</p>
<p>Gravity sucks to simulate because it&#8217;s long-ranged. You can formulate this either as having to consider many non-negligible pair-wise interactions, or as having to update field strengths over a large volume.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>For most intents and purposes you can formulate gravity the same way you formulate the other forces, namely as a field that permeates space, where the evolution is &#8220;local.&#8221; As far as a simulation is concerned, &#8220;local&#8221; means that the value of the field at position P and time t+1 only depends on the values of the field at P and its neighboring points at time t.</p>
<p>One consequence of the locality of gravity is that if the sun suddenly disappeared, it would be about 8 minutes before we flew off into space.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s already been covered by others a bit, but that&#8217;s a newtonian way of thinking about gravity. With relativity effects are all local and propagate out at the speed of light. That&#8217;s why you can have things like gravitational waves. These actually makes things a lot easier to simulate, computing the next time step of the simulation need only look at the neighboring bits of space once things are initialized (not to sound too much like Wolfram&#8230;).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Non-relativistic gravity has local field equations as well: laplacian V= rho, where rho is the local charge density. A very easy way to find the potential of a point mass is to solve laplacian V = 0 in spherical symmetry (rho =0 in the vacuum around the mass) . A similar truck can be used to get the Schwarzchild metric, but the relativistic equations take quite a bit more work to solve.</p>
<p>The absurdly complicated part in relativity is the boundary conditions. In newtonian physics, the equations are linear, so the field of particle 1 and particle 2 is just the sum of the two individual fields. Not so in general relativity.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Isn&#8217;t electromagnetic force pretty similar? Every positive charge exerts a force on every other positive or negative charge in the universe. It just so happens that most positive charges and negative charges are closely enough bound to each other that the net effect of both of them together decays at an inverse fourth power or something else much faster than an inverse square. But to get things technically right, you do need to consider all of them.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Unhelpful answer:<br />
If the universe is a simulation, <i>ipso facto</i> the simulator has enough computing power to simulate it, so this can&#8217;t be that serious a problem. Maybe they just have really good hardware and the calculation is exported to a hundred thousand cores running in parallel timelines.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the universe is a simulation, the simulator doesn&#8217;t in fact need to do gravity calculations in the technically correct way, they can just round it to zero at some plausible threshold and program an exception that runs the full calculation for really well-done physics experiments. Or not, and print an experimental design error code, or something.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The really annoying thing to simulate is quantum mechanics. In classical mechanics, if you have two particles moving in three dimensions, you can describe the state with 12 real numbers: each particle&#8217;s position and velocity has three components.</p>
<p>In quantum mechanics, you need an infinite number of real numbers just to describe the state of these two particles. The state is determined not by 6 numbers but by a wave *function* f(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2) that gives the probability* of finding particle 1 at (x1,y1,z1) and particle 2 at (x2,y2,z2). </p>
<p>This is one way of thinking about how quantum computers could in some cases be more powerful than classical computers. To describe the state of 100 classical bits, you need&#8230; 100 bits. To describe the state of 100 qubits, you need 2^100 = 10^30 classical bits, because the quantum state specifies a different probability for each possible combination of 0&#8217;s and 1&#8217;s, and there are 2^100 possible combinations. So it&#8217;s very very expensive to simulate a quantum computer with a classical computer. But a quantum computer could simulate a quantum computer quite easily!</p>
<p>*well, really the complex square root of the probability</p>

I celebrated by talking about the <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.navalgazing.net/Jutland-The-Blockade" rel="nofollow ugc">British blockade of Germany</a>, having covered Jutland itself quite well in previous years.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the past two weeks, I&#8217;ve been taking a close look at the revolutionary Tomahawk cruise missile, from its <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.navalgazing.net/Tomahawk-Part-1" rel="nofollow ugc">origins as a nuclear missile</a> through <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.navalgazing.net/Tomahawk-Part-2" rel="nofollow ugc">the very interesting anti-ship version</a> to <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.navalgazing.net/Tomahawk-Part-3" rel="nofollow ugc">the early conventional land-attack weapons</a>, as used in Desert Storm.  On Wednesday, I&#8217;ll finish the series with a look at where it is today.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ve continued my tutorial for Aurora, a very interesting 4X game.  The series starts <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.navalgazing.net/Aurora-Tutorial-Part-1" rel="nofollow ugc">here</a>.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I must have read and re-read the page for The Toblerone half a dozen times.<br />
Each time I&#8217;d think &#8220;Yeah, okay, I guess I get it. I can sort of picture what kind of character that is.&#8221;<br />
And then I&#8217;d forget and have to re-read the page when I saw it linked elsewhere.</p>
<p>In contrast, I haven&#8217;t read the page for Boisterous Bruiser once. I knew immediately, from the name, what that&#8217;s all about.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Graduate?  I&#8217;m old enough to remember when hiring a neighborhood teenager was a perfectly reasonable solution to the &#8220;I need someone to look after my kids&#8221; problem.  In fact, I&#8217;m pretty sure I started being that neighborhood teenager in late middle school, 7th or 8th grade.</p>
<p>Long term, I suspect the problem solves itself because the societies that won&#8217;t let teenagers take care of children will inadvertently wind up teaching all of their young adults that they can&#8217;t or don&#8217;t want to <i>have</i> children.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Don&#8217;t know the ins and outs of the American system, but from Irish experience that is not totally unreasonable.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need a degree in early childhood education, a basic <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.qqi.ie//sites/docs/AwardsLibraryPdf/5M2009_AwardSpecifications_English.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">certificate</a> &#8211; Level 5 on this wheel <a rel="nofollow"href="https://nfq.qqi.ie/" rel="nofollow ugc">here</a> &#8211; is the minimum required to get a job in childcare (be that creche, playschool, whatever) here.  It&#8217;s vocational training with a work experience placement needed.</p>
<p>What it does is that everyone has an understood qualification with the same basic components.  A Masters in Social Work is great, but do you know how to calm down a crying two year old who has just bitten one of their little playmates?  The problem with the example quoted is that she is <i>too</i> qualified on a <i>theoretical</i> level for the job (you need a Level 5 award, she has a Level 9 award); you can start with a Level 5 cert and work your way up to a Masters if you like but the other way round does require &#8220;we need you to have the basic qualifications that everyone else on the job does&#8221;.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need a rocket technician to fix your lawnmower, you get what I&#8217;m saying?  Also, if the American rules are like the Irish rules, the regulations* say &#8220;you need X qualification to be hired&#8221; and it doesn&#8217;t matter what additional or higher you have, if you don&#8217;t have X, you can&#8217;t be considered (that&#8217;s not just red tape, there&#8217;s every possibility an unsuccessful candidate with a Level 5 will cut up rough over &#8216;she doesn&#8217;t have the Level 5 why did she get the job instead of me&#8217; and the threat of LAWYERS makes institutions very, very nervous).</p>
<p>*</p>
<blockquote><p>A FETAC/QQI Level 5 Certificate is considered a baseline qualification and is a requirement for people working in services participating in the ECCE scheme.  It is important to note that under the terms of the ECCE scheme it is necessary for Playleaders in each participating service to have a full FETAC/QQI level 5 qualification. </p></blockquote>
<p>  Hire someone without the Level 5 for your room and sorry, you are not getting that funding subsidy.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p><i>I’m old enough to remember when hiring a neighborhood teenager was a perfectly reasonable solution to the “I need someone to look after my kids” problem.</i></p>
<p>That&#8217;s the &#8220;make sure they don&#8217;t stick their fingers in the electrical socket and that they get something to eat&#8221; solution, which for basic childminding is all most parents want for a few hours before they get home from work/at night so they can go out.</p>
<p>Nowadays, childcare is also to enable both parents to go to work, and there&#8217;s a range of things the child is supposed to be doing in regards to attaining developmental milestones.  In the Bad Old Days of Oppression when women were at home raising their own kids these generally happened naturally but now we need to ensure that the kids are not just being stuck in front of the telly watching cartoons and that they are put on the path that will lead them along the steps of the educational and qualifications ladder so they get good productive white collar jobs to become contributing tax-paying members of society.</p>
<p>Which is why your neighbourhood teenager, if they want to work in childminding services, needs to undertake the below as one module of their training course:</p>
<blockquote><p>The purpose of the Early Childhood Education &amp; Play course is to equip you with the knowledge, skill and competence to ensure that each child’s learning, development and well being is facilitated through the provision of opportunities, experiences, activities, interaction, materials and equipment, having regard to the age and stage of development of the child and the child’s cultural context.</p>
<p>Learning Outcomes:<br />
-Outline the types, stages patterns and purposes of children’s play<br />
-Describe a range of theories of play in the context of children’s education to include -Psychoanalytic theories (Freud, Winnicott) and Constructivist theories (Piaget, Vygotsky)<br />
-Evaluate the role of the adult in children’s play<br />
-Explore a child lead approach to meeting the play and educational requirements of children<br />
-Describe different approaches to curriculum development and implementation in the ECCE setting<br />
-Assess the value of equipment, materials, play spaces, both indoors and outdoor in the ECCE setting<br />
-Use a range of reading and storytelling techniques appropriate to different stages of children’s development and cultural background<br />
-Select relevant play activities and materials appropriate to children’s interest, stage of development and cultural background<br />
-Implement appropriate curricula which promotes learning and the holistic development of the child<br />
-Reflect on own role and responsibilities when supporting children in their play</p></blockquote>
<p>You may well be up on your Constructivist Theories, John Schilling, but not all parents can make up that shortfall themselves! 🙂</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p><i> parents have to pay $2000 per month per kid.</i></p>
<p>Still likely to have to pay that, because the teenager you are paying $50 to watch your kid for a couple of hours is doing it in your home (hence no overheads for her to cover), you&#8217;re not likely to sue her and her parents if, when you come home, little Johnny fell down and scraped his knee (so no insurance costs), and he/she is being fed, clothed and sheltered by their parents so the money is going to whatever teenagers spend stuff on plus savings and not &#8220;wage I need to pay my mortgage and live on&#8221;.</p>
<p>A commercial childminder, even &#8220;Ms Jones who runs it out of her house&#8221;, is covering a whole lot of expenses plus wanting to make a profit out of it on top of that, like any other business.  Even if she is using her own family as unpaid labour, those costs and incentives remain.  &#8220;Ms Jones Merry Kids Fun Place&#8221; that is a separate building hiring on staff comes under a ton of regulations and requirements and is costed accordingly.  The staff don&#8217;t need university degrees (I think the article is misleading, in that it&#8217;s from the point of view of &#8216;I already have Excessive Qualifcations, why do I need to have these to get hired as a childcare practitioner?&#8217; slant rather than &#8220;what qualifications do you need and why?&#8221;) but they still need <i>some</i> training, and they need some level of wages to make it worth their while to leave their homes and go out to work every day.  $50 for &#8220;just make sure little Johnny doesn&#8217;t play in traffic&#8221; for three hours childcare isn&#8217;t going to work on that scale.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>hiring a neighborhood teenager</p></blockquote>
<p>When our daughter was little, we hired a girl to help with babysitting; she was eleven. The original idea was that she could watch the baby while Betty was cooking and such, but it turned out that she was an eleven year old adult, sufficiently so that we were willing to sometimes leave her in complete charge of the baby. She continued as our baby sitter for several years.</p>
<p>That was nearly thirty years ago. Many years later I got an email from her — she had apparently come across something I posted or some reference to me online. She attached a photo of the fighter plane she was now pilot of.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>This is a clear example of college being a proxy for conscientiousness. Certainly college coursework is not necessary and likely rarely relevant, not nearly as relevant as having a couple younger siblings, but as a first pass way to narrow down a candidate pool with zero effort, probably does some work. </p>
<p>Oh, wait, it&#8217;s a government regulation, not a dumb HR rule? That sounds like cargo cult thinking.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>People with college degrees looking for work in the child-care sector are probably thinking this is a great idea.</p>
<p>Probably so are upper-middle-class parents who are looking to hire professional child care and don&#8217;t want to have to think about whether the caregivers are A: trustworthy and B: smart and cultured enough to give their precious younglings a proper middle-class upbringing.</p>
<p>An awful lot of stuff the poor and working classes desperately need, is increasingly illegal to offer in the market because the middle to upper-middle classes are afraid that if it were available they might accidentally buy it without thinking about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;any&#8221; is pushing it quite far but if you cannot leave kid with sixteen year old then there is something wrong with either one (it is not necessarily their fault &#8211; for example in a case of a very complicated disease).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I tried cooking with a kitchen scale for the first time last night, and it is just as revolutionary as everyone said. The only real issue is with things that don&#8217;t pour well, or don&#8217;t pour well *slowly*.</p>
<p>For example, a lot of liquids will tend to stick to the outside of bottle and end up under the bottle rather than the opening if you try to pour them slowly. But pouring quickly means you overshoot the weight. Any ideas on how to solve that problem?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The trick to sticky and viscous liquids is usually oil.  For example if you have a recipe that calls for honey+oil in in you measure the oil first and then the honey second and the honey will just slide right out of the measuring cup.  You can wipe a tiny bit of oil around the lip of your jar and that will reduce the cling and allow it to flow more freely without dripping down the edge.  Of course you will get small amounts of oil in your molasses/honey etc so not a solution for everything.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8230; honestly, mostly not buying things in containers that will not pour well. You can pour the offending item into a measure (Measures always pour well) but that rather defeats the point of the whole &#8220;Weigh things to avoid too much cleaning&#8221; so I just note if something comes in a container that cant pour well at all and stop buying that brand &#8211; oil in particular should not be giving you problems, so either you are Doing It Wrong &#8482; or the bottle manufacturer is.</p>

Figure out what the minimum average amount is getting poured for the shortest fast/clean pour, and then scale from based on that amount.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>So since they have been pushing eager mode, TF has gotten much easier to learn.  It is now very much just like Numpy, or any other linear algebra platform.  I was able to pick it up just by reading the few tutorials on the TF website, then trolling the documentation.  But I strongly recommend sticking to the low-level architecture while you are learning.  If you want a standard dense layer, write the matrix ops yourself.  That will force you to develop a better understanding of what is going on below the hood.  You can save yourself time by using the higher-level APIs once you are a pro.</p>
<p>If the question you are asking is &#8220;how to I learn to think in linear algebra,&#8221; that is a little harder.  There is a lot of power to be found from replacing your for loops with linear algebra operations, but it is not always obvious, at least not to me.  I think I just looked at a lot of examples.  Sometimes I write out an algorithm using loops first, get it working, and then spend some time thinking about it and exploring ways to replace the loops.  It takes some tinkering and multiple attempts, but I can usually come up with some improvements eventually.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Not sure if this counts as a hot-button political/social topic; it&#8217;s Irish history from the 16th century so it still might be live (and it tangentially includes Spanish liberal revolutions and Henry VIII-style suppression and seizure of monasteries from the 19th, so beware!)</p>
<p>We <i>might</i> be close to finding the <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52832801" rel="nofollow ugc">remains</a> of <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Roe_O%27Donnell" rel="nofollow ugc">Red Hugh O&#8217;Donnell</a>!  Cue traditional air, <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5FBVOKzUvA&amp;list=RDu5FBVOKzUvA&amp;start_radio=1&amp;t=4" rel="nofollow ugc">Lament for O&#8217;Donnell</a>.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that the church where he was buried disappeared.  How does a church disappear, you ask (or at least I asked myself)?  Especially when Christopher Columbus had been buried there? (Before his body went on its own series of fascinating peregrinations):</p>
<blockquote><p>He died in the northern Spanish city of Valladolid in 1506, after returning from his final expedition to the “New World”, only to be moved to a monastery near Seville three years later. But in 1537, the newly opened cathedral of Santa Maria la Menor in Santo Domingo – a territory founded by Columbus – was deemed a much grander burial site, so the Genoese explorer’s remains embarked on their second journey, this time to the Dominican Republic.  What was left of the revered navigator stayed in the cathedral at Santo Domingo until 1795, when France took control of Hispaniola (the Caribbean island that is now split between the Dominican Republic and Haiti) from Spain under the terms of a peace treaty. Not wanting the French to take possession of Columbus’ remains as well, the Spanish had them removed to Cuba, then part of Spain’s extensive global empire. Yet by the end of the 19th century the Spanish Empire was a fading force and in 1898 the Spaniards renounced control of Cuba – as well as handing over Puerto Rico and The Philippines to the United States – in the Treaty of Paris. Columbus was moved back to Seville and buried in a forbidding tomb inside the city’s gigantic cathedral, thus completing his fourth posthumous journey.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, turns out the Church of Miracles of Valladolid was part of a larger Franciscan monastery, and first during the Peninsular War parts of it were seized, occupied, sold off or let fall into disrepair, and then later in the 19th century during (one of) the Spanish liberal revolutions, it was all confiscated and sold to secular purchasers, or at least those willing to come forward and buy parts of the property and buildings.  Being confiscated from the monastic order and the former occupants forcefully evicted, the entire complex was left abandoned, allowed fall into ruins, and eventually the ruins were cleared and new buildings built on the site.</p>
<p>Which brings us neatly back to the present day.</p>
<p>You may think (as did I) that Spain was a very Catholic country, but it seems that there were <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_confiscation" rel="nofollow ugc">quite a few</a> waves of &#8220;let&#8217;s take these properties off the Church and sell them to finance the national debt&#8221; over the centuries, along with moves towards secularisation during liberal reforms and revolutions.  And yes, the Freemasons were involved 🙂 (this <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_%C3%81lvarez_Mendiz%C3%A1bal" rel="nofollow ugc">English-language</a> Wikipedia article on the 19th century main mover of one such alludes to that, the <a rel="nofollow"href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_%C3%81lvarez_Mendiz%C3%A1bal" rel="nofollow ugc">Spanish-language version</a> goes into his family background etc. in a lot more detail).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I have a question about the scientific method. To what extent is the scientific method responsible for technological development? For example, with pharmaceutical development, I&#8217;m pretty sure the scientific method is heavily involved, with all the trials and reviews before a drug is allowed to go on the market. But what about other pieces of technological progress? Computers, GPS, the internal combustion engine, agricultural advance, etc. Most of the definitions of the scientific method I have seen involve hypothesis testing, rigorous data collection, and peer review. How well does this describe the process of inventing and developing the computer, or the GPS, or the internal combustion engine? Is the scientific method an accurate description, or was it more like very knowledgeable and creative people trying different things and seeing what works?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m not sure about the internal combustion engine, and there are people who are far better to explain this than me. But both GPS, and modern microchip computers make use of concepts, that we have because of Einsteins relativity. We have Einsteins relativity because people did rigorous tests about what they thought to know about the world. (In this example physicists not beeing able to find evidence for the Ether).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ll try to answer regarding computers, because it&#8217;s my area.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s definitely a scientific/experimental aspect to developing the hardware itself. How can I turn this analog physical behaviour into a digital (i.e. discrete) logical signal? How will this material behave under thermal stress? How physically small can I make this logical unit before the error rate becomes unacceptable? etc.</p>
<p>On the software side, the gold standard is to have mathematical theories. Many subareas of CS are brimming with elegant results, and we have a deep understanding of how to get the basics right: computational complexity, algorithmics, distributed systems, signal processing, statistical learning, information theory, cryptography, etc. All of this is not &#8220;sciency&#8221; science, but rather &#8220;mathy&#8221; science. For algorithms this is illustrated well by the typical introductory CS material: sorting algorithms are O(n*log(n)), 3-SAT is NP-hard, here&#8217;s how you create a self-balancing binary tree, and so on.</p>
<p>However, some of the most prominent algorithms today don&#8217;t fall in this category. The most salient example of this is machine learning, where progress often consists of designing a new architecture and statistically testing its performance, with deep understanding of why it works coming much later, if at all. Other examples are linear programming, SAT solvers, query planning for databases, and so on. Often, these are problems that are either theoretically unsolved or known to be hard in the worst case, but we have heuristic algorithms that are fast most of the time. Progress here tends to fall more on the sciency side, but there&#8217;s a lot more tinkering and just trying shit out involved than in a &#8220;proper&#8221; scientific experiment. One reason for this is that collecting high-quality data tends to be much easier than for &#8220;real-world&#8221; science. Other times, the problem is ill-defined and subjective, so there&#8217;s not even an unambiguously correct solution (e.g. rendering algorithms in computer graphics).</p>
<p>In conclusion, one good chunk scientific method, but also huge chunks of stuff that&#8217;s either more rigorous or less rigorous.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m not sure if trying different things and seeing what works would fall under the standard definition of the scientific method. Because trying different things and seeing what works describes a very broad range of human activity, and did not start at any historical point, such as the scientific revolution. In fact, most things people do probably involve some degree of trial and error. Even the most primitive neanderthal would try different ways to grip the spear until he settles on the best way (not sure if neanderthals had spears, but you get my point). But I wouldn&#8217;t call that the scientific method. Obviously, when it comes to technological breakthroughs, this trial and error is happening on a much higher level, because of the knowledge/intelligence of the people involved.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>In my opinion, what made the scientific revolution special, was that the scientific method became the <i>sole</i> metric for determining how the natural world worked, and consequently became dramatically more disciplined.</p>
<p>Before then, there was trial and error, and that was in line with the method. But the trials were less carefully measured and recorded. Furthermore, the explanations still permitted being based on things like &#8220;the gods willed it&#8221; or &#8220;corresponds to our fingers&#8221; or &#8220;the king said so&#8221; and so on. The scientific revolution began when people consciously tried to explain everything in nature without those extra-method arguments.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Outside of middle-school textbooks, &#8220;the scientific method&#8221; isn&#8217;t really one thing.  Debates over epistemology in general, and over research methods in particular fields, are fierce and ongoing.   Across time, practices differ widely, as you&#8217;d expect, depending on institutional contexts and political/economic/cultural constraints (formal peer review, for instance, is <a rel="nofollow"href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2018/09/26/the-rise-of-peer-review-melinda-baldwin-on-the-history-of-refereeing-at-scientific-journals-and-funding-bodies/?fbclid=IwAR0gVF2jt4G0JxpN5a8XNT_anyl3pX4MY4NGXHkx_HkeK0NzwBYSmpll-XI" rel="nofollow ugc">apparently quite recent in its origin</a> and has more to do with funding structures than with epistemic virtue). </p>
<p>With that said, if we&#8217;re taking &#8220;the scientific method&#8221; in its middle-school sense, implying a falsifiable hypothesis in response to a genuine research question, tested through a rigorously designed experiment, etc.&#8211; then I don&#8217;t see how that would apply to technology at all.  Science aims at abstract understanding of the natural world; technology at practical production of novel objects or effects.   Science quite often uses technological tools, and technology quite often uses scientific knowledge, so I admit there&#8217;s been a lot of overlap in personnel between the two endeavors&#8211; but at base, wanting to <i>understand </i>something and wanting to <i>make</i> something are just fundamentally different goals, no?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It also doesn&#8217;t really apply to a lot of science either. If you want &#8220;falsifiable&#8221; hypotheses then you&#8217;re going to have to decide what counts as a falsification.</p>
<p>The Quine-Duhem problem is one major problem. Was Newtonian gravitation falsified by the perihelion shift of Mercury? Nowadays we think of that as one of the crucial tests, especially once they failed to discover the planet Vulcan that supposedly caused this. (If you don&#8217;t wait until the non-discovery of Vulcan, then you have to say Newton was falsified by the anomalies in the orbit of Uranus until Neptune fixed everything.)</p>
<p>Statistical theories are another major problem. I don&#8217;t exactly know the relationship Popper had with Neyman and Pearson, but many Bayesians might suspect that Popper is behind the unholy dominance of Neyman-Pearson statistical testing, not just over the Bayesian alternative but also many Fisherian methods as well.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>To what extent is the scientific method responsible for technological development? </p></blockquote>
<p>Foundational. A Chinese economic historian, whose name now escapes me, wrote about this a few years ago. Why did China not go through the development process of the West despite having invented a large amount of innovative stuff in history up until ~1700 (when the process of divergence started in earnest).</p>
<p>His answer was essentially that the West &#8220;invented science&#8221;, by which he meant a formal method of discovery that put an emphasis on rigor and documentation, not to mention later also a patent system. I still think this institutionalist answer remains very compelling, much more so than the geographic determinist answers or &#8216;drain theory&#8217; etc.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Battleships are, if you&#8217;ve ever seen one, really fricking huge.  They also have to be stored somewhere on a coast, a merely one-dimensional locus of possible hiding places, and they require regular maintenance in major port facilities of which even the great powers had only a handful.  It&#8217;s not really practical to hide a working battleship from professional spies.</p>
<p>Nuclear warheads can be stored in relatively small underground bunker that can be hidden just about anywhere, and the necessary maintenance facilities are not much bigger.  Complete ICBMs are a bit more conspicuous, and there you can at least insist that, once you know they exist, you&#8217;ll assume that they continue to exist unless their owners smash them to bits in the presence of your observers.  But if you e.g. let your arms control treaty lapse and dither about trying to negotiate a new one, the other side may say &#8220;Oh, <i>those</i> missiles we dismantled last year&#8221; and you&#8217;ll never know for sure.</p>
<p>Short and medium-range missiles tend to be dual-use, along with strike aircraft, so even if the enemy lets you inspect them and verify that they aren&#8217;t currently fitted with nuclear warheads, it&#8217;s hard to be sure there isn&#8217;t a bunker full of E-Z-fit nukes just down the road.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s really complicated.  There&#8217;s the bay bulkhead, which is fixed in place to preclude ALCM installation.  Not sure how long it would take to pull that out.  If the B61 uses standard suspension components (not sure offhand), you could presumably load 24 to the rotary launchers this afternoon if you were so inclined.  But modern bombs have to talk to the airplane, and there&#8217;s been no reason to spend any money on the B-1s nuclear avionics since the early 90s.  And they&#8217;ve done a complete refresh of those systems since then.  Because nuclear-certifying software takes a ton of time and money, I&#8217;m pretty sure that the B-1 doesn&#8217;t have the code to talk to the B61.  So now you have to get that written.  If you do it the normal way, probably 3-5 years.  You could do it in less, but you&#8217;re running more risks of things going wrong.  And people almost never let you use &#8220;risks&#8221; and &#8220;nuclear weapons&#8221; in the same sentence.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>On the B-1?  Unlikely.  They&#8217;ve gotten enough access to the pylons to hang a targeting pod on one, but I haven&#8217;t heard of them doing external carriage of weapons, except for very briefly during the test program, and that was both a long time ago and before the pylons were blocked.</p>
<p>Edit: Addendum to my post above.  I checked one of my books, and they used separate rotary launchers for nuclear and conventional weapons, although I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the changes were pretty much entirely on the wiring/electronics side.  Of course, most if not all of those launchers were probably converted to the current conventional rotary launchers, which weren&#8217;t in the original equipment for the B-1.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The B-1 carries JASSM-ER today, so there&#8217;s really no reason to give it CALCM capability.  (Not to mention that CALCM was officially retired 6 months ago.)  As for nuclear capability, probably not.  We have the B-52 for ALCM, and the B-2 theoretically handles all the strategic nuclear gravity bomb missions.  (I&#8217;m skeptical about fleet size on that, but it&#8217;s worth pointing out that the B-52 officially lost its gravity bomb capability only a couple years ago, and I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ve done any major software upgrades since then, so refitting the B-52 with B61 and B83 capability will be a lot easier.)</p>

<p>Agreed that the wiring and software is a bit more complicated, at least if nobody already did it last Thursday.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The fastest, and most generally useful, way to do it would be to kitbash a &#8220;B61 mod 13&#8221; that impersonates a Mark 83 or a GBU-32 or something else a B-1 is already set up to talk to and deliver.  And every other aircraft in the fleet.</p>
<p>This could almost certainly be done safely enough for wartime use, even if it doesn&#8217;t quite meet current safety standards in peacetime.  Bean is correct that &#8220;doesn&#8217;t quite meet current standards&#8221; is not going to fly in the real-world US military any time soon, but for arms-control purposes everybody has to assume that everybody else is secretly thinking about doing this and maybe did it last Thursday.</p>
<p>It mostly doesn&#8217;t matter because we mostly don&#8217;t care about aircraft bombs in serious nuclear warfighting &#8211; everything important will have been nuked by missile before the bombers ever reach their targets.  But if we&#8217;re imagining a future in which even the superpowers are limited to say 200 missile warheads each, that will change.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t think the B-1 has Mk 83 capability.  For reasons that are mysterious to me, the Navy likes the Mk 83, while the USAF refuses to acknowledge that it exists.  I&#8217;d guess you&#8217;d make it imitate a Mk 84/GBU-31.  Other than that, if you were willing to do this, it would be a good plan.  But nobody is going to be OK with this.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>First, what John said.  You can&#8217;t hide a working battleship, you really can&#8217;t hide a battleship being built, and even if you just want to mothball one in secret, it&#8217;s going to be extremely tricky.  (Battlecruisers, at least ex-German Turkish ones, might be a different story&#8230;)  </p>
<p>Second, there&#8217;s the matter of raw numbers.  The largest fleet of dreadnoughts ever was Britain&#8217;s, and it was less than 50 at the end of WWI.  Compare to thousands of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Third, military secrecy was nothing like it is today.  They were shockingly open by modern standards, and I suspect a lot of the secrecy we deal with now dates back to the Manhattan Project, which was a massive industrial enterprise taking place almost entirely off the radar.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Even then, the Manhattan Project had some kinda obvious-in-retrospect security fails. My great-grandfather was involved in the medical research side of things; apparently he figured out what was going on when he got a letter from the War Department ordering him to report to Los Alamos, went to check out a book on New Mexico from the university library, and found that everybody who knew anything at all about nuclear physics or radiation, all of whom had mysteriously left town over the preceding months, had checked the same book out.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You know, that makes an interesting point about how much harder espionage was back in the day. While this is a pretty glaring red flag, the actually information was most likely stored only in the book itself and the library&#8217;s files. It would have taken a spy to both be holding the book and know off the top of their head a list of reputable physicists to actually put two and two together to glean anything useful. </p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s a security flaw, because all that information would be on a unsecured server somewhere.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Or it is not. Pre computers, the common system was simply a piece of cardboard or heavy paper stock in a pocket in the book you would record your name on and leave at the library when you checked a book out, so the library had a record of all books checked out, and who had them, that piece of paper stayed with the book so anyone holding it also knew the last dozen or more people who checked that book out.<br />
Modern practice is a bar code or QR code on the book, and some way to identify yourself to the library when you check out, the library then has a database of who currently has a book checked out. Those databases are however very frequently deliberately prone to amnesia &#8211; the second you return the book, the library system forgets you ever checked it out. </p>
<p>Because the library has no actual need to know who checked out a book in the past, and the easiest way to avoid privacy and data mining concerns is to just not retain the information.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The process was helped along immensely by the fact that battleships were expensive, the older ones were obsolete, and the major powers all genuinely wanted to economize.   the ships that were called for scrapping were, for the most part, not very effective in modern (i.e. 1920s) combat and could not have been made so without expensive modernization. Only the British really had to give up highly capable ships, and the US didn&#8217;t even build up to its treaty limits for most of the treaty period.</p>
<p>Capping the naval race within relatively fixed boundaries really took the wind out of its sails.  As others have pointed out, it&#8217;s not like you could build a fleet, or even squadron, of battleships in secret, so there wasn&#8217;t a real way you could gain serious advantage.   There was plenty of creative accounting and sometimes outright cheating around the various tonnage limits (the <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogami-class_cruiser" rel="nofollow ugc">mogamis</a>win the gold star here, with a claimed treaty displacement of 8,500 tons) but even this most blatant example of cheating bought them a grand total of maybe one extra ship.  Ships take years to build, so it just wasn&#8217;t possible to obtain a serious numerical lead before people noticed.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p> and the US didn’t even build up to its treaty limits for most of the treaty period.</p></blockquote>
<p>This isn&#8217;t really true.  The WNT had no limits on any ship under 10,000 tons, and everyone was up against the battleship limits immediately (Britain retained a few of the KGVs until the Nelsons were ready, IIRC).  The carrier limits were a different matter, but they were still experimental in the early 20s.  After the 1930 LNT, there were limits on smaller ships, generally somewhat greater than the size of the current fleets.  Because ships are expensive and take time to build, the plans from this point on were basically &#8220;let&#8217;s hit the treaty cap in 5-10 years&#8221;.  And by the time they were getting close, the 1936 LNT was signed, removing all fleet tonnage caps anyway.  There&#8217;s a reasonable theory that the treaties helped navies during the Great Depression because they were easy to spin as targets, not just as caps, while the armies and air forces had no such protection, and took more cuts because of it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Hiding ships would be hard, but the naval disarmament treaties defined classes of ships in terms of things like displacement and caliber of guns and imposed limits on how many of each class a country could have. I don&#8217;t know of any countries that cheated on caliber — the German pocket battleships, which were basically heavy cruisers with 11&#8243; guns instead of 8&#8243; guns, were taking advantage of a loophole in the rules. But I believe that both Italy and Germany cheated on displacement, built ships that were bigger than they were claimed to be, and other countries may have as well.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Japan was notorious for breaking the displacement limits.  On one class of Japanese cruisers (may have been the Mogamis), a British constructor is reported to have said that the Japanese were either cheating or building the ships out of cardboard.  And nobody lied about caliber, AFAIK.  There were some cases of deception, but that&#8217;s a slightly different thing.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Perhaps others misunderstood my question to be more intelligent, but I meant something exactly as stupid as &#8220;The US and UK scuttle their fleets on Monday, and then on Tuesday, when it&#8217;s the Japanese&#8217;s turn, they say &#8216;take-backsies&#8217; and decide not to scuttle theirs, becoming the preeminent naval power overnight.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did not mean secretly hiding warships, I meant faking their destruction. It would be a very short term ruse.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My not very expert understanding is that, in the post WWI naval disarmament, scuttling existing ships was mostly limited to ships that were no longer of much use, such as pre-dreadnoughts. The important reduction was either not completing ships that had been laid down — the Japanese, as I recall, completed two battle cruisers as (permitted) aircraft carriers (Kaga and Akagi), which arguably turned out to be an improvement — or not building additional ships.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>In the case of the WNT, one big aspect is that not everybody was starting from the same place.  Japan actually decommissioned exactly one dreadnought.  Their cuts were primarily in the massive building program.  The UK had no dreadnoughts under construction, so their scrapping was of older ships.  The US was somewhere in the middle.  So there&#8217;s no risk of Japan doing what you describe, and the British simply didn&#8217;t have the money or public support to try anything like this.  Also, if Japan reneges, they&#8217;re unambiguously the bad guy, and the US and UK combine to crush them.  (Remember that there&#8217;s no threat to the British in European waters at this point, so they can deploy their whole fleet.  This was very much not the case 20 years later.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Here are two possible reasons that occur to me. I have no particular evidence to support either.</p>
<p>1. Lack of evidence: Until cameras became nearly ubiquitous via both smart phones and body cameras, the only evidence the cop had done something wrong was another person&#8217;s claim. If the cop denied it, you had the word of the cop against the word of the accuser, many of whom are doubtless convicted criminals. Now, if different people with no connection kept claiming that cop X did some illegal thing, that would be pretty good evidence, but assuming cop X didn&#8217;t do it too frequently, there&#8217;d wouldn&#8217;t be enough evidence to prosecute.</p>
<p>2. If cops didn&#8217;t get extreme benefit of the doubt, they&#8217;d have a strong incentive not to engage with criminals: I would guess that suspects claim cops have misbehaved in a very high percentage of cases that involve physical contact between cop and suspect. It would seem there&#8217;s little reason not to make such a claim because it could get your case thrown out. If authorities gave credence to such claims at any point except when they were supported with conclusive proof, the logical response for police would simply be to avoid any physical confrontation and let people go on committing crimes.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Another issue I suspect is that there are a lot of very unprofessional things which the police can do but which are really difficult to measure in the first place. Consider the &#8220;rough ride&#8221; treatment that the Baltimore Police were known to do. Sure, a dead body is nice, objective evidence. But how do you separate &#8220;intentionally drove in a way to maximize discomfort&#8221; from &#8220;geeze &#8211; this car needs a new suspension, the road has lots of potholes, and the sergeant wants this prisoner transport completed as urgently&#8221;?</p>
<p>If Floyd hadn&#8217;t died (or suffered permanent injury), would anybody have cared? Would anything have been able to have been proven?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think it&#8217;s important to note the limits of qualified immunity &#8212; it only applies if (a) the officer personally (b) is being sued in civil court for money damages for (c) violating a statutory or constitutional right.  So to the specific question here, qualified immunity has nothing to do with whether an officer can be criminally charged.  (It also doesn&#8217;t protect officers from things like internal discipline, stop lawsuits against their police departments, etc.)</p>
<p>Also, each state will have its own, state-law version of qualified immunity when suing state officials, which may or may not be broader for federal qualified immunity, and might shield an officer as well.</p>
<p>So yes, I think &#8220;qualified immunity&#8221; is becoming a bit of a buzzword, although that is different from asking whether it is too broad regardless.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t think qualified immunity is the end-all be-all, but if a dismissal for unnecessary force was accompanied by a $5M civil decision it would be a pretty big incentive not to go back to policing (and not to have done whatever it was in the first place).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Also juries don&#8217;t like sending cops to jail&#8211;bad things might happen to a cop in jail. Even if the cop was both a) a dirtbag who beat up a criminal and b) unlucky because the criminal died from the beating, the jury may feel the cop probably feels pretty badly about that and doesn&#8217;t need hard time locked in with a bunch of criminals, particularly given perceptions (not sure how widespread, but not zero) that many prisons are basically a-rape-a-day facilities for less popular inmates like pedophiles and cops.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Three reasons. First, the doctrine of qualified immunity extends very broad protections to government employees, shielding them from responsibility for things they do on the job.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualified_immunity" rel="nofollow ugc">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualified_immunity</a></p>
<p>Second, law enforcement officers in many states have procedural protections in the form of Law Enforcement Officers&#8217; Bills of Rights that ordinary citizens do not. This tends to give officers a lot of time to get their stories straight before questioning.</p>

<p>Third, juries tend to be very deferential to police officers, giving them very broad benefit of any doubts. This makes prosecutors leery of trying to prosecute cops unless the facts are very cut and dried.</p>

<p>Cops should probably always be investigated and tried by a different group, such as state police or FBI. This raises some &#8220;who watches the watchers?&#8221; issues but I think smaller ones than we started with.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>As a criminal defence lawyer, I am genuinely shocked by the simplest explanation not having been presented yet: </p>
<p>Cops are on the right side.  </p>
<p>Way, way, way, way too many prosecutors and judges see the police as heroes doing a difficult job, while ordinary citizens should get out of the way/let the police handle it/probably started it. </p>
<p>The cops get the benefit of the doubt more than they should, but I would argue what they get is a lot closer to what everyone should get &#8211; and doesn&#8217;t. </p>
<p>It has nothing to do with the system lacking the power to hold police to account, and everything to do with the system simply having very little interest in doing so and lying to itself about there being a need to do so.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>There are quite a few people who work as police officers for a while but don&#8217;t do it for an entire working career. In many ways it&#8217;s a younger man&#8217;s game- cuffing someone who&#8217;s resisting arrest isn&#8217;t easy.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Hi there&#8230;your name looks familiar, somehow.</p>
<p>Anyway: my impression is that Police officers can get the best training if they begin in a large Police Department of a big city. In that city, they&#8217;ll often start as a &#8216;walk the beat&#8217; cop, in which they walk their beats by&#8230;driving a car around an area, in the company of a more experienced officer.</p>
<p>They have options after that point: take training to become a Detective, move to a specialist unit like Vice/Homicide, or keep &#8216;walking the beat&#8217; until they are experienced enough to train another rookie.</p>
<p>Or they might look for open positions in small-town Police Departments. Or they might become security consultants for locations like casinos/concert-venues/churches/banks/etc. </p>
<p>One of my siblings, who did Police Academy and worked a few years as Patrol Officer in a major-city PD, had side jobs crop up. As long as those jobs didn&#8217;t conflict with his role as an Officer, he could take a security gig. Where he was, the occasional movie producer wanted off-duty cops to run security on the movie set. There were also local apartment/condo units that would pay Police to be on-site security guards.</p>
<p>I never did get a grasp for the average age of the average Patrol Officer, nor what the usual career-path was for Officers after their first five years. (My sibling decided, before his five-year-mark, to go to a new career that didn&#8217;t any of his law-enforcement background&#8230; I don&#8217;t know how common that is, either.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Would it be worthwhile to make police officers buy &#8220;misconduct insurance&#8221; to pay damages resulting from their misconduct, like car drivers? And if they had a record of minor misconduct, their rates would go up until they were forced from the profession?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Isn&#8217;t this already a thing?</p>
<p>I swear I read an article about some Sheriffs department in rural California that like, had to work with its insurance company and re-negotiate and implement all sorts of reforms because they had too many issues and complaints and the insurance was going to drop them and they basically can&#8217;t operate without it.</p>
<p>I think it only applies to smaller locations though, because big city police departments are &#8220;self-insured&#8221; by the local government coffers.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That sounds like per-department insurance. A much worse idea than per-officer insurance.</p>
<p>In general when an officer misbehaves, the department ends up paying the fine. This is bad because it removes most of the incentive for officers to behave. But making the officer pay directly doesn&#8217;t work either, because few officers have millions of dollars saved up to fund a wrongful death suit. So the solution is insurance on a per-officer level. I think.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;d bite that bullet, the problem is what happens when someone refuses to pay a fine? Eventually you have to have a punishment of last resort. Of course that isn&#8217;t an issue in the police-brutality case. If a cop can&#8217;t afford or get approved for police-brutality insurance he can&#8217;t be a cop anymore. The comparison would be to medical-malpractice insurance. This obviously has its own issues, but I do think it would be better than the current law enforcement system.</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t work for crimes in daily life, because what happens if a person can&#8217;t afford their insurance (either they are too risky or their income is too low) &#8211; you don&#8217;t allow them to live until they can pay it? You put them in jail until they can pay it? How exactly are they going to develop the job skills to pay for it in jail?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The problem is they cost taxpayers.</p>
<p>Obviously lawyers go after police departments (=taxpayers) because they have deeper pockets than individual officers. Of course this removes the officer&#8217;s incentive to behave.</p>
<p>The point of insurance is to provide deep pockets for individual officers too.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Good question. I really don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>With drivers, insurance companies use data to calculate someone&#8217;s risk, for example record of traffic violations. Are there any such calculations for doctors? Is there any way of knowing a doctor&#8217;s malpractice rate except for extremely rare successful lawsuits against them?</p>
<p>For police, pretty much every interaction is with an emotionally uncooperative other party, and now there is the expectation of wearing body cameras, and many officers have a record of smaller disciplinary actions before they get around to killing. So there should be more than enough data for insurance companies to calculate risk.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Would it be worthwhile to make police officers buy “misconduct insurance” to pay damages resulting from their misconduct</p></blockquote>
<p>I have seen arguments for years on this from activists in Minneapolis. The thought is that cops might hesitate before they thump someone if there was a financial penalty to pay. Also a couple of supplementary arguments for it: then the city wouldn&#8217;t have to pay damages when a cop went bad, and that way the insurance companies would ensure that thumpers would be pushed out of police-work because these cops couldn&#8217;t get insurance anymore. I am a little on board, but I think there are down-sides:</p>
<p>1) Obviously the likelihood of cops getting into these circumstances varies greatly; an office job not at all, a tough neighborhood much greater than a peaceful one. Should the cops have to pay more insurance because they work in a tough neighborhood. I suppose the department could vary the salary for different environments, but it would be complicated.<br />
2) Not sure if insurance would make a difference in cop behavior &#8212; reckless drivers still exist even though they pay for it with higher insurance rates.<br />
3) Will the insurance companies cooperate? Sounds like a a lot more work on their part.<br />
4) Do we want the insurance companies to be in charge of what is acceptable.</p>
<p>Might be worth an experiment.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why you don&#8217;t have regulations creating an assigned risk pool.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think the issue with this is how much the rates would need to go up to actually force someone out of the profession. As we&#8217;ve been discussing on other OTs, unjustified / questionable police shootings are still relatively rare, and even adding in other unjustified uses of force, it&#8217;s still probably a small fraction of the millions of police &#8211; citizen interactions happening each year.</p>
<p>Building a model to stratify by risk when the baseline level of risk is very small is really a hard problem, even with massive training datasets and years of experience. Take credit risk &#8211; the baseline risk of a generic corporate going bust is probably on the order of 1% per year. The most sophisticated risk models might be able to assign some corporates to a category with an estimated 10% probability of default (10x the risk) &#8211; not 70 or 80%. A company that is assigned that PD will still in many cases seek financing and deal with the extra interest.</p>
<p>If the baseline rate is now only a tenth of that &#8211; 0.1%, the situation becomes harder still. Your baseline actuarially-fair insurance premium is going to be 0.1% of the average settlement (so, maybe $10m x 0.1% = $1,000, plus insurer profit margin &amp; capital charge). It would be <i>fantastic</i> if you were able to build a risk model with a first-decile capture of 70% in a new domain like this (when I&#8217;ve built models in new domains I was happy with 60%, and that was with a higher baseline risk, which makes calibration much easier) &#8211; so that would mean your bottom 10% of officers would have a hazard rate of 0.7% while the other 90% have a hazard rate of 0.033%. </p>
<p>So now you can charge the bottom 10% $7k per year and everyone else $333 per year. (obviously there would be gradations within that group, and maybe if you&#8217;re lucky you get a smaller but really uninsurable group that contains 30-40% of the total &#8220;bad apples&#8221;). Is a ~$6.5k premium enough to drive a really committed officers out of the force? Especially if some portion of the risk rating is due to the community / geography they are policing (meaning it will be partially subsidized)? At the margins, yes, but I&#8217;m not sure overall. </p>
<p>And if you can only get the first-decile capture up to 50%, then you&#8217;re talking about a $4.5k difference, etc. Plus there will be political pressure to limit the spread of insurance costs, especially when police recruiting becomes a challenge &#8211; and this political pressure is not unfair, because in my example, the &#8220;bad&#8221; group is 99.3% good apples and only 0.7% bad &#8211; so charging them all $7k per year might never get anywhere.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Thanks for the criticism. </p>
<p>Would insurance stop someone like Timothy Loehmann, who resigned from a prior cop job rather than being marked as lacking the emotional stability to be a cop, from being a cop at all?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>There are definitely &#8220;uninsurable risks&#8221; in many types of insurance, so I think it&#8217;s certainly possible. But to me it depends on the base rate of these risks vs the base rate of the negative outcomes. I.e. how common is it that someone faces the situation that Loehmann did? And how many unjustified uses of force were carried out by such people? If 1,000 people per year end up in such a situation, even if they only have a 50% chance of turning bad, it&#8217;s no problem to call them uninsurable&#8230; but if they have a 10% chance, maybe it&#8217;s harder. </p>
<p>And if those diagnosed with lacking emotional stability only account for 10% of the uses of force, then you need to find a bunch of other variables that have the same strong link to negative outcomes, such that it is considered &#8220;fair&#8221; to rule them uninsurable.</p>
<p>Overall I do like the concept of insurance for these types of risks and think it is an idea worth some experimentation; I&#8217;m just a bit pessimistic about our ability to build good enough models in such an untested area.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I agree that creating those models would be a very challenging exercise, but one of the nice things about relying on a profit-motivated insurance system is that it provides an incentive for someone to figure out these complexities. If insurance company A has a terrible model, then they&#8217;re more likely to go bankrupt than company B, which has a realistic model. Over time &#8212; ignoring outside interventions (e.g. from politics) &#8212; we would expect the insurance companies with superior models to gain market share, ensuring that a larger and larger proportion of the police force had their insurance premiums set by progressively more accurate models.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure it would remain imperfect, but I can&#8217;t think of any equivalent motivation to push the current system toward greater &#8220;accuracy&#8221; in filtering out bad cops, other than occasionally triggering societal anger enough that we get pushback (whether via voting or via massive protests). And those feedback mechanisms don&#8217;t necessarily seem calibrated to provide good information either.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m not sure insurance does a great job of discouraging bad doctors or corporate board members or whatever.</p>
<p>IMHO, I&#8217;d recommend:</p>
<p>(1) End qualified immunity. Probably the states and counties would end up agreeing to pay the money judgments, but that would encourage police departments to clean up their acts.</p>
<p>(2) Outlaw police unions from interfering with or negotiating terms of disciplinary proceedings.</p>
<p>(3) Continue improving data in terms of who gets stopped, who gets use of force, improve punishments for police whose body cameras aren&#8217;t on, even when it&#8217;s not an emergency, etc.</p>
<p>The risk is that you might demoralize a police force that is, for all we know, mostly operating the way we want them to.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>England and Wales have recently (in the last few years) brought in a blacklist of officers who were either fired for misconduct or resigned while under investigation. These officers now cannot be hired as police (or I think as civilian* staff), or provide services such as consultancy or training to police forces.</p>
<p>This was introduced after Simon Harwood, a member of the Metropolitan Police TSG (riot squad) struck Ian Tomlinson, an innocent passer-by, with his baton and killed him. Harwood ended up being acquitted of manslaughter (for various reasons largely to do with a poorly conducted autopsy), but it emerged during the trial that he had resigned from the Met for health reasons while under investigation for misconduct. He then worked for the Met as a civilian for a while, then joined the neighbouring Surrey Police as an officer, before transferring back to the Met.</p>
<p>*Normally I don&#8217;t like referring to non-police as civilians, but it seems to be a sensible way to describe people who are employed by the police but aren&#8217;t police officers.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Given the thread (a few days ago and below) about &#8220;quake reads,&#8221; I&#8217;d like to unpack David Deutsch&#8217;s <i>The Fabric of Reality</i>, which I&#8217;ve mentioned on SSC a few times.</p>
<p>Deutsch&#8217;s <i>modus operandi</i> is to take what he considers our best, most accurate, most well-tested, and truest scientific theories and push them as far as they can logically go. His candidate is quantum mechanics, and his &#8220;far as it can go&#8221; is the multiverse. Deutsch pretty much invented the concept of quantum computing, and I think he has an unanswerable argument about the actual existence of parallel universes: If Shor&#8217;s algorithm is ever implemented on a 1,000-qubit quantum computer, those exponential upon exponential computations have to take place *somewhere*&#8211;and that somewhere is the 10&gt;100 parallel universes employed in the calculation.</p>
<p>But that is just the beginning. In <i>The Fabric of Reality</i>, Deutsch weaves together evolutionary theory, quantum mechanics, and ontology to explain the role of knowledge in the universe. The examples he uses are highly conserved gene sequences, like those for ribosomal DNA, which are nearly identical across all types of life (from bacteria to human beings). Alter a single base pair in these genes and the protein does not function. The situation is different for other proteins, like hemoglobin, which come in more varieties and are thus &#8220;easier to vary&#8221; compared to the most highly conserved proteins, and is even more different for &#8220;junk DNA,&#8221; which probably serves some function but is even easier to vary without deleterious results.</p>
<p>Now, imagine taking a multiversal view of these proteins and gene sequences. Across 10&gt;near infinity universes, the highly conserved gene sequences will stand out against the ones that are easier to vary. You would actually see the knowledge in these genes &#8220;crystallized&#8221; against the multiversal background. I don&#8217;t remember if Deutsch actually puts it this way in the book, but what it comes down to is: knowledge is structure across universes.</p>
<p>This formula would applyto all sorts of knowledge, not just the kind contained in genes. Imagine you had a pair of &#8220;multiverse glasses&#8221; and you looked at the <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript" rel="nofollow ugc">Voynich Manuscript</a>. If Voynich has genuine meaning, and is not a piece of gibberish produced as a 14th-century prank, it would &#8220;glow&#8221; with multiversal knowledge, since the semantic structure would be preserved across exponentially more universes. The same would apply if you looked at a nearby star with a &#8220;multiverse telescope.&#8221; If there is an intelligent civilization on a planet circling that star, it would &#8220;glow&#8221; with crystallized knowledge; you wouldn&#8217;t need to receive a radio transmission to know it was there. (Evolutionary theory comes into the picture from the fact that knowledge, by definition, whether in genes, in manuscripts, or in people, has to evolve; you don&#8217;t get knowledge for free. Creating knowledge, Deutsch stresses, is hard work.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve read the book, so perhaps other Deutsch fans can weigh in with any mistakes or omissions&#8230;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>If Shor’s algorithm is ever implemented on a 1,000-qubit quantum computer, those exponential upon exponential computations have to take place *somewhere*–and that somewhere is the 10&gt;100 parallel universes employed in the calculation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Um. . . what?  There are two obvious reasons this is dumb.</p>
<p>1) You can make the same arguments about classical physics at which point it becomes clear how nonsensical this is: The three body problem requires solving a differential equation that has no analytic solution to infinite precision.  But since we implement multi-body interactions all the time, those computations must be carried out somewhere.  So . . . parallel universes, I guess?</p>
<p>2) Many worlds is a theory about why wave functions appear to collapse.  Wave function collapse is not a part of Shor&#8217;s algorithm.  The actual computations in Shor&#8217;s algorithm (or any quantum algorithm) work just fine in our normal, unitary quantum mechanics, which doesn&#8217;t require any notion of collapse or many worlds.  In fact, you have to go to great pains to prevent decoherence in the actual machines.  The many worlds are only involved in the measurement of the outcome of the calculation.</p>
<p>This is just such a mind-boggling wrong-headed view of quantum mechanics, I can&#8217;t believe anyone would claim this.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>+1. The exponential computation only happens in a theoretically constructed &#8220;view&#8221; of what the computer is doing (the Hilbert space). You could also view a classical randomized algorithm in this way (i.e., you are actually computing all possibilities in parallel and discarding all but one after the fact). This is a correct model that explains the behaviour of randomized algorithms, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it is <i>literally</i> happening.</p>

<p>Many worlds makes claims beyond those of QM. It&#8217;s not just a claim that Hilbert space computes more efficiently, it&#8217;s a claim that it has a particular structure.</p>

Deutsch is one of the most universally respected quantum theoreticians out there, so just going on my priors, I will trust his viewpoint.

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Well, you know, Stephen Hawking kept saying we were 10-20 years away from a theory of everything.  When really famous people make big claims in popular science, as opposed to academic, venues or peer reviewed literature, it can sometimes be a bit outlandish.</p>
<p>But that claim as phrased doesn&#8217;t hold up to even the smallest amount of scrutiny.  The &#8220;calculations&#8221; are just unitary operations in a Hilbert space.  There&#8217;s absolutely no need for many worlds for that, and it&#8217;s almost the opposite of what the concept was invented for.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>To try to steelman Deutsche a bit:</p>
<p>One intuitive objection people have to many-worlds is that it feels bad to postulate that the state of the universe is so unnecessarily big &#8212; that in addition to the &#8220;world&#8221; we see, the universe also contains a bunch of other versions of the world. Shouldn&#8217;t we prune away the other worlds from the theory with Occam&#8217;s Razor?</p>
<p>I think a defensible version of Deutsche&#8217;s statement is something like, &#8220;A working quantum computer would show that the Hilbert space really is as big as QM says it is &#8212; that N qubits have a Hilbert space of 2^N dimensions.&#8221; Each of those 2^N dimensions corresponds to a different combination of N classical bits. The Hilbert space of the universe as a whole has a dimension for each classical arrangement of the stuff in it. So every possible arrangement of classical stuff has some amplitude in the wave function of the universe. So despite the intuitive Occam&#8217;s-Razor argument above, the state of the universe does have to be really really big.</p>
<p>Nothing requires you to interpret all those amplitudes as &#8220;worlds&#8221;, so Deutsche goes too far if he says this &#8220;proves many-worlds&#8221; or something like that, but I don&#8217;t think a working quantum computer is irrelevant to the question.</p>
<blockquote><p>Many worlds is a theory about why wave functions appear to collapse.</p></blockquote>
<p>I dunno, I think decoherence explains why wave functions appear to collapse, independent of any interpretation. I think I&#8217;d say that many-worlds is a way of talking about the wave function. Given a wave function with amplitudes for two possibilities, do we talk about them as two possible but mutually exclusive outcomes (Copenhagen) or two coexisting outcomes (many-worlds).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Anatid That&#8217;s wrong. Decoherence doesn&#8217;t explain wave function collapse. It explains why the density matrix would become diagonal, with a bit of hand waving. Collapse requires picking one particular diagonal element of the density matrix. It needs a selection mechanism that decoherence absolutely does not provide. Many worlds just says that all of those diagonal elements continue to exist as separate worlds, but this has some issues with the born rule.</p>

<p>Totally agree!</p>
<blockquote><p>Decoherence doesn’t explain wave function collapse. It explains why the density matrix would become diagonal</p></blockquote>
<p>I only said decoherence explains the *appearance* of collapse. By which I mean it describes how we go from a state of </p>
<p>&#8220;The particle is in a 50/50 superposition of spin up and spin down, and also the experimenter doesn&#8217;t know which way the spin is going to end up, and also the measurement apparatus hasn&#8217;t recorded which direction the spin is&#8221;</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>&#8220;50/50 superposition of (particle is spin up, and experimenter thinks it&#8217;s spin up, and measurement apparatus displays &#8220;spin up&#8221;) and (particle is spin down, experimenter thinks it&#8217;s spin down, and measurement apparatus displays &#8220;spin down&#8221;), and also the two branches of the superposition are almost certainly not going to interfere with each other anymore&#8221;</p>
<p>which is a 50/50 superposition of two states of the world, in both of which the wave function *appears to have* collapsed (one way or the other).</p>
<p>Totally agree that decoherence doesn&#8217;t actually pick out one of those two 50/50 possibilities though.</p>
<blockquote><p>this has some issues with the born rule.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah I feel like the Born rule is the biggest problem with many worlds. My inclination is to just postulate it fundamental law but that is unsatisfying, not least because it seems a bit tricky to define what the Born rule even means in many worlds.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It wouldn&#8217;t necessarily have to come from reverse transcription. We can imagine that once upon a time there was a chemical structure that managed to duplicate itself in purely analog ways. At some point, it also managed to start transcribing nucleic acids into amino acid sequences in more digital ways. Over time, random nucleic acid sequences got transcribed in this way until at some point some collection of nucleic acid transcripts managed to function in a way that also did this transcription. Eventually this new transcriber replaced the old one, and now all we have left is digital replicators using the digital transcription process. It didn&#8217;t have to be developed from the old analog one by some reverse transcription process &#8211; it just could have independently evolved and replaced an older one that we no longer have traces of.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Ribosomes are where information gets converted into protein.</p>
<p>As far as life on Earth goes, there is only one possible source of genetic information &#8211; DNA transcribed into mRNA &#8211; and a relatively small pool of amino acids that every living organism uses when mRNA gets translated into protein.</p>
<p>Which means the parts of the ribosome that interact with the mRNA template and those directly interacting with the amino acids and the polypeptide being formed can only change so much before you break protein synthesis and end up dead.</p>
<p>While theoretically you could evolve to use some other system, the raw materials for it don&#8217;t exist in nature. (Because everything alive is using DNA and the same amino acids. And only the &#8220;left handed&#8221; versions of amino acids, even something as &#8220;minor&#8221; as evolving to use the &#8220;right handed&#8221; ones has proven too costly.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Speculating wildly, maybe when the ribosome-like-thing first arose it wasn&#8217;t so critical and not much depended on it, so it was free to mutate and evolve without any mutation instantly killing the organism. But eventually the whole structure of life came to depend on ribosomes making proteins from RNA in a particular way, so there was no more freedom for ribosomes to vary since it would screw up everything that depended on it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Because CW stuff has been literally enraging me lately, I&#8217;ve decided to give up social media (Facebook and Twitter, the ones I use) for a week.  I&#8217;m also trying to avoid &#8220;the news&#8221; in general but haven&#8217;t made a hard commitment there.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it will be too difficult.  I don&#8217;t actually *like* social media that much, it&#8217;s just like, something I do when I get bored, which happens a lot.  The biggest problem is that during these brief moments of boredom, grabbing my phone and checking social media has become something of an instinct.  It&#8217;s just what I do when I have a couple minutes to kill.</p>
<p>So, does anyone have any suggestions of either other things to do on my phone that can kill a couple minutes (it can&#8217;t be any serious reading, for serious reading I need 10+ minutes and a distraction-free environment), or something else I can do when I feel the boredom instinct coming on (note that sometimes this happens like, when I&#8217;m in an elevator or something)?</p>
<p>If I find a successful replacement and the experiment works, I may give it up longer-term.  I&#8217;m keeping SSC comments as a place where I can CW in a respectable and dignified manner without getting <i>too</i> angry (and the fact that we&#8217;re no-CW for half the week should help!)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>There&#8217;s a series of mid-tier technical books called &#8220;97 Things Every ____ Should Know&#8221;.  They&#8217;re collections of short (1-3 page) essays from professionals organized around a loose theme, with each essay basically being a single distilled point of advice.  I find that one section is a really good fit for a 5 minute gap.  This specific series will be less useful to you if you don&#8217;t work in tech, but there may be similar works in other fields.</p>
<p>Alternatively, Flow Free is a game that supplies a large number of spacial reasoning puzzles that can each generally be completed in a minute or two.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Can confirm, Flow Free is a fun game. Looks to me like it&#8217;s 1:1 with circuit board layout. Having done circuit board layout, I didn&#8217;t find it challenging for a while, but a couple of the 8&#215;8 boards are giving me pause.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>1) Chess puzzles. Plenty of apps out there that just show you endless chess puzzles. Really great way to kill 30 seconds.</p>
<p>2) Have you considered taking up another language? Anki is a general-purpose flashcard program/app. Anything you want to memorize you can find decks for, or you can make your own decks. If you&#8217;ve been wanting to brush up on your spanish or something, load up Anki with spanish flashcards. Pull out the phone, do five flashcards while waiting in line.</p>
<p>These are what I use on my phone when I have to kill a few minutes.</p>

I&#8217;ve set myself the challenge of getting the pangram, since that&#8217;s the best scoring word, but it&#8217;s disappointing to pass over the dozens of shorter words. So thanks!</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Reddit is a good way to kill a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>As far as dumping news and FB and so on, I went through that process last August. A few lessons learned: </p>
<p>1) I went cold turkey on FB and deleted my account. I was tired of the way it made me feel, and I replaced it with actually making a point of calling a friend on the phone when I got the urge to check FB. The key is to replace habitual behaviors with something healthy, rather than just try to dump something habitual all at once. Figure out what you like about facebook and find a way of separating that out from the Panopticon of Anxiety, and keeping it.</p>
<p>2) As far as the news, I wanted to pull myself out of the 24-Hour Outrage Cycle, but I wanted to keep any eye on developments that might be important to my family.  What I did was to take all my news web sites and stick them in a bookmark folder called &#8220;Sunday&#8221;. Once a week, on Sunday, I open everything in the folder and read through it to see if there&#8217;s anything going on that will affect me or my family.</p>
<p>3) 10 months later, I&#8217;m still keeping both behaviors going. Looking back, the only thing that really surprised me about the process was how much <i>easier</i> it was than expected. I was reading the news two Sundays after starting the system and&#8230; it was <i>terrible</i>. I got through it, learned what I needed to, and moved on. Not remotely tempting. I can&#8217;t find the real quote but something something Mark Twain: &#8220;The cure for reading the news is to read last week&#8217;s news&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>While sugesting reddit as an way to avoid social media feels like suggesting Heroin to avoid Meth</p></blockquote>
<p>True, but a properly curated Reddit homepage can be a lot less rage/despair inducing than Twitter/Facebook, so maybe it&#8217;s more like nicotine patches to avoid smoking?</p>
<p>In addition to /r/AskHistorians, I&#8217;d also recommend /r/AskScience, /r/AskScienceFiction and /r/ExplainLikeIm5 are also pretty good.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I quit all social media in 2012 and started actively avoiding journalism in 2016. I don&#8217;t own a smartphone. [ETA: Each of these actions alone vastly improved my quality of life. All three of them together and I&#8217;m damn near a constant state of bliss.] If you were planning to go at this for more than a week I&#8217;d recommend ditching the smartphone, but since it&#8217;s just a week, I recommend you start a challenging creative project and train yourself to think about it in spare moments.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>By the way, here&#8217;s what I do to train myself in a new habit:</p>
<p>I choose a length of time, usually a week or a month, during which I want to train myself in the new habit. Then I tally (on a spreadsheet I look at each morning, but you can use anything) each day I do that thing. Then at the end of the training period I see how many days out of the training period I did the thing. Then I try to improve on that with another consecutive training period of the same length, and so on until it&#8217;s a real habit.</p>
<p>For something that&#8217;s multiple times a day, I&#8217;ll require myself to do the thing X times before I&#8217;m allowed to mark a tally for the day. So if you&#8217;re able to notice yourself about to reach for your phone and then stop yourself and do something else, say, twice in a day, you could count that as mission accomplished for the day. Then gradually increase X.</p>
<p>You could also do an inverse version of this, where you get a tally by default unless you pick up your phone and start to check social media, say, 3 times. So you give yourself a kind of 3-strikes-you&#8217;re-out system.</p>
<p>Let me know if that makes sense or not.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m guessing you&#8217;re not much into fiction, huh? Because my go-to for phone content is relatively lower word count fanfiction.</p>
<p>Other people have found that their writing productivity has increased many times over by doing it on their phone in the little break moments. </p>
<p>I also tend not to go for my phone at all because I listen to music instead.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>For years my boyfriend had been trying to convince me to cut down on social media (Facebook and Reddit). But during the pandemic, once I realized I was at home all the time, I deleted the social media apps from my phone, since I now no longer have those minutes at the bus stop or on the airplane or whatever that made it seem necessary to have them on my phone. And on my computer I have a blocker installed that blocks social media sites (I think it&#8217;s currently set to operate 9 am to 6 pm 7 days a week on one computer, and 9 am to 5 pm five days a week on the laptop). So I&#8217;ve drastically cut down on my use. And neither Facebook nor Reddit is nearly as interesting or compelling once I&#8217;m interacting with them in a single block or two a day, rather than as constant back-and-forths on multiple topics.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll have to see what makes sense for me to do once I start traveling again.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a replacement, but I do use Pokemon Go for some of those down moments.</p>

<p>I also have the Blue Letter Bible app on my phone, and when I have a few odd minutes, I&#8217;ll try to work my way through the Greek or Hebrew of a verse or two.  It&#8217;s improved my koine Greek and Biblical Hebrew skills quite a bit, albeit quite slowly.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@Le Maistre Chat,<br />
Treasures indeed, that&#8217;s awesome!<br />
FWIW I think Leiber&#8217;s earlier stuff is usually better (my guess is he peaked around 1970), and FWLIW the very first book I bought at my favorite bookstore (when it was across the street from my Junior High School) was <i>A Princess of Mars</i> with the Frazetta cover, I can&#8217;t remember what was my next purchase, but the one I <b>remember</b> next was <i>Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre</i> by H.P. Lovecraft.<br />
Trying to dig up my C.L. Moore anthology right now as I have a hankering for some Jirel of Joiry tales again, if I lose patience looking for it I may go with Niven&#8217;s <i>The Magic Goes Away</i> again, or finally (after decades!) finish <i>The Dying Earth</i>, but what I feel shamed (by all the rave reviews) into trying again is <i>The Shadow of the Torturer</i> or <i>Perdido Street Station</i>, but I just never could get far into them before</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My younger son taught himself to read when he was two and was reading the Narnia books by four. That raised the problem of finding books for someone with adult reading skills and a child&#8217;s tastes. So I gave him the Barsoom books, I think at about six. As best I remember it worked, but I should ask him for his memory of reading them.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Round 2 looking for what Tyler Cowen <a rel="nofollow"href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/11/view-quake-read.html" rel="nofollow ugc">calls</a> “quake reads.”:</p>
<p>Most nonfiction authors like making big statements about little subjects, or small statements about big subjects. I’m looking for those that make big statements about huge topics, and change your whole viewpoint on life.</p>
<p>A few examples to make my point clearer: Rene Girard, Carl Jung, Joseph Campbell (The Power of Myth), Yuval Noah Harari (Sapiens), Nassim Taleb (The Black Swan), Robert Greene, Michel Foucault, Matt Ridley, Jared Diamond, Freidrich Nietzsche, David Graeber (Debt: A 5,000 Year History), and Julian Jaynes (The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind).</p>
<p>These people have totally flipped my worldview, and I want to be amazed again. Do you have any recommendations for authors that make huge statements about grand topics. </p>
<p>Note that I am posting about this again because I feel that the answers are so open, and that there is always the possibility of discovering a world-shaking read. The amount of books out there is immense, and the more I can learn about the great ones the less I will have to waste time reading the mediocre ones.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I do not understand the reverence that many people have for The Black Swan and NT in general.</p>
<p>I read about three quarters of it a couple years after it came out and my recollection was that it contained one valuable insight that could be expressed in a very few words — rare calamities happen considerably more frequently than people believe they do — and then hundreds of pages of NT saying what a smart guy he is and how revolutionary his observation is.</p>
<p>What am I missing? What more is there in that book?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s arguably not even true that people underestimate the frequency of rare calamities. e.g. selling stock options makes money on average, prediction markets consistently overestimate the likelihood of rare events, and selling insurance is profitable.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>selling insurance is profitable</p></blockquote>
<p>That is not really relevant, insurance is paying overall to avoid a catastrophic loss.</p>
<p>It is not betting that insurance company underestimated risks.</p>
<p>(and neither apply in cases like USA &#8220;health insurance&#8221; where you are de facto buying a subscription)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>What more is there in that book?</p></blockquote>
<p>The book is two things.  Its first the observation that unexpected events happen too frequently* and the second is that our systems are set up to work only if these unexpected events don&#8217;t happen more frequently than we think they will.  If you take those two parts as correct then its functionally the most important book of the last X years, where X is an impressive number.</p>
<p>*Not the actual insight, the actual insight is that you cannot predict the rate of future unexpected events from past events, which carries a whole different set of implications and is much more important.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You should check out his book Skin in the Game. That book is much shorter than Antifragile and The Black Swan, and has a great wealth of mental models, especially for ethics. I think that Taleb&#8217;s strength lies in telling stories about his concepts, circling around them to make them clear and strong in the mind. I personally think that is writing is funny; his feisty Lebanon background really shows. I remember him saying that Twitter is the natural state of mankind, like arguing with each other in the marketplace. </p>
<p>One thing that I most respect about him is his independence. I always like listening to autodidacts.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>As you get older and read more, shouldn&#8217;t we expect to encounter such books less often? That is, books that would be &#8220;quake reads&#8221; for our younger selves wouldn&#8217;t be for our older selves. There&#8217;s a reason certain books end up being enthralling and exciting to teenagers that aren&#8217;t to adults.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think that is definitely true. One other thing that age adds on is a propensity to not change your thoughts, which could also affect how make &#8216;quake reads&#8217; you experience. When you&#8217;re young you are still moldable, which is ultimately the prime virtue of youth (as Proust says). I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily say that you would encounter less quake reads when you are older, just that you may not actually respond to them like a young person would.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Henrich, &#8220;The Secret of Our Success&#8221; (which I was introduced to by Scott&#8217;s review a few months ago) was like this for me. Also Kahneman, &#8220;Thinking, Fast and Slow&#8221;. Maybe Michael Pollan&#8217;s book &#8220;The Botany of Desire&#8221; (I think I only read one of his later books, but none of the reviews suggested they were as captivating as this one, with its central thesis that plants bred us rather than us breeding the plants).</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, I think of Sapiens, Guns Germs and Steel, and Debt as ones I feel similarly about, from the ones you mention (though Debt is one of the very few books I haven&#8217;t been able to bring myself to finish, because of its infuriating attempt to ignore that he&#8217;s just refuting just-so stories with his own just-so stories).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think it depends on what you think the point of the blogroll is. If the point is to actually direct people to some of these blogs, then the new version is better. But if the point is to convey the tone of this blog and make people stay here, then the old one is better. It&#8217;s like the difference between a bookstore that has clearly labeled shelves and bright lighting, and one that evokes a literary atmosphere with lots of dark wood and velvet and everything labeled in ornate and unreadable fonts.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The annual Little Lytton contest asks contestants to write one-sentence answers, to the prompt: the worst first sentence to a novel. The trick (and challenge) is in writing a sentence that is bad without lacking authenticity; if it sounds like you&#8217;re <i>trying</i> to write a bad sentence, it isn&#8217;t funny. &#8216;Intentional unintentional comedy&#8217;.</p>
<p>The organiser and judge compiles a shortlist, adding commentary (which is often even funnier than the entries themselves). It&#8217;s easy to spot bad writing, but often much harder to explain why it&#8217;s so bad, and he does a good and entertaining. I won&#8217;t quote any submissions here, as tastes will differ as to what is and isn&#8217;t funny. I&#8217;ll just urge you to have a look yourself, if you&#8217;re not already familiar: <a rel="nofollow"href="http://adamcadre.ac/lyttle.html" rel="nofollow ugc">http://adamcadre.ac/lyttle.html</a></p>
<p>Submissions for 2020 close 15 June.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>A rundown on murder rules in Minnesota, for some reason. I know a great deal about criminal law, but am not from Minnesota, so this might be wrong in serious ways. This is important because it affects the punishment if the person is convicted. (Note: I have changed my handle to make me more Google-proof; I have posted before on criminal law issues.)</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk basic murder principles:</p>
<p>Every state has different rules. You&#8217;ve got your deliberate murder: Scott likes bananas, and I hate them, so he decides he wants to kill me with lots of bullets. Then he does. Easy. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s implied malice murder. In preparation for shooting me, Scott uses his firearm for target practice in his multi-occupant home and it kills either another occupant or someone outside. He knows it&#8217;s dangerous, but doesn&#8217;t care. That&#8217;s also murder. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s also felony murder, which is very different in different states, but the basic rule is that when Scott and Scott Aaronson decide to rob David Friedman&#8217;s house with David in it, and SSC Scott turns out to be a little more stabby than Scott Aaronson expected, that&#8217;s still murder for both of them; maybe check out your co-robbers next time.</p>
<p>If you engage in dangerous behavior that you don&#8217;t know is dangerous to human life even if it&#8217;s stabbing someone 37 times in the chest, that&#8217;s manslaughter in most places due to something called the &#8220;merger rule.&#8221; If you are assaulting someone, that&#8217;s usually not a predicate felony for murder; you have to show some sort of malice. </p>
<p>In Minnesota, the officer was charged with <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.195" rel="nofollow ugc">third degree murder.</a>.</p>
<p>Third degree murder in Minnesota is implied malice murder. So: Acting without the intent to kill, but with some appreciation of the risks that were ignored. </p>
<p>Second degree murder, as every outlet which has covered this will tell you, requires intent to kill. But, that&#8217;s not correct generally as <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.19" rel="nofollow ugc">second degree murder</a> in Minnesota includes most felony murders. Is it correct in this case? This case would only be covered by the merger doctrine if Minnesota were located in (say) California; as it is Minnesota has<br />
<a rel="nofollow"href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5538607785534236406&amp;q=felony+murder+merger+rule&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,24" rel="nofollow ugc">rejected the merger doctrine</a> and permits felony assaults to be the predicate felony for murder. </p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s a felony assault? Well, a <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/2019/cite/609.223" rel="nofollow ugc">third degree felony assault</a> includes one where there is substantial bodily injury occurs. Is that good enough? Do we bootstrap almost every felony assault that ends in death as a murder? Probably. </p>
<p>It gets complicated from here, but a <a rel="nofollow"href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=163950946884389420&amp;q=felony+murder+merger+rule&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,24" rel="nofollow ugc">shaken baby case</a> where a late secondary appeal was denied on procedural grounds very strongly implies that it is. This would make an assault causing death using <a rel="nofollow"href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11031000556032513192&amp;q=felony+murder+merger+rule&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,24" rel="nofollow ugc">objectively dangerous</a> behavior second-degree murder in Minnesota, even if the person did not appreciate the risk. </p>
<p>Now, again, I&#8217;m not an expert on Minnesota law and I haven&#8217;t seen this discussed anywhere by anyone, so there&#8217;s always the chance I am wrong. It&#8217;s also very possible that this has been covered and my Google-fu failed. A third possibility is that I&#8217;m right and it&#8217;s lonely here. Place your bets. </p>
<p>Maybe Georgia later.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>According to this, the three cops who were in the scene but did not prevent the death can be charged with 2nd degree felony murder as well.</p>
<p>A principle that afaik is not codified anywhere but can still be used by the prosecution as an argument to the jury that police officers must be held to a higher standard of restraint in the use of force than say an ordinary citizen defending themselves.</p>
<p>At the end it will all come down to whether the prosecution can be relied upon to pursue this case earnestly without giving in to pressure from police organizations and the politicians aligned with them as well as the choice of jury.</p>
<p>More interestingly, what needs to happen for them to be tried under federal murder statutes rather than a &#8216;civil right violation&#8217; ?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Even more than that- every officer who contributed to the blue line that caused the murderer to feel empowered to continue his pattern of felony assaults could be considered an accomplice to the assaults, and thus catch heat for the murder.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really think it&#8217;s in the interest of justice to actually prosecute the entire PD for the murder, but having someone credible put the option on the table would go a long way towards stopping police everywhere from being accomplices to felonies committed by other police.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think the entire chain of command from Derek Chauvin and up to the commissioner or whatever the equivalent in Minneapolis is should see their careers terminated on the spot and possibly face civil liability for not having prevented it but no it does not make sense to criminally prosecute officers outside the command chain who were  not involved in this incident  even from the same PD, this is just not how criminal responsibility works.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Does that standard apply to other criminal conspiracies?</p>
<p>Suppose that Alan and Bob and Carl go out felonously robbing people together every few days.  One day, Carl gets sick and stays home &#8211; and that&#8217;s the day Alan kills someone.  Bob can obviously be charged with felony murder, but would Carl be charged too for helping establish the pattern of felonies?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Legally, I&#8217;m pretty sure Carl isn&#8217;t eligible for a felony murder charge in that case.  Pragmatically, we want to encourage Carl to walk away from the whole thing as soon as Alan gets too murdery, and we do <i>not</i> want to encourage Carl to stick around so that he can make sure there are no surviving witnesses to whatever Alan does that Carl can never not be punished for.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It depends on:</p>
<p>1. If Carl helped plan the specific robbery, and to what degree; and<br />
2. The state they are in.</p>
<p>In California, Carl&#8217;s off the hook either way. It&#8217;s very unlikely to be provable, because even if prosecutors make deals with Alan and Bob to testify against Carl (and, prosecutors, don&#8217;t do that) they&#8217;ll need solid additional evidence because both the law and jurors think that accomplices might lie for their own benefit.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Minnesota murder law seems very unique to Minnesota.<br />
In Minnesota state law defines substantial bodily harm to mean &#8220;bodily injury which involves a temporary but substantial disfigurement, or which causes a temporary but substantial loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ, or which causes a fracture of any bodily member.&#8221;<br />
A lawyers website talking about Minnesota says &#8220;Substantial bodily harm is the mid-level category. It is defined as “bodily injury which involves a temporary but substantial disfigurement, or which causes a temporary but substantial loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ, or which causes fracture of any bodily member.” A broken bone or other semi-permanent injury are typical of this level. Also, if someone is left temporarily unconscious (knocked out), this “impairment of the function of a bodily member or organ,” in this case, the brain, will qualify. In several cases, a cut that required stitches also qualified.&#8221;</p>
<p> This is more than run of the mill bodily harm(fifth degree assault under normal circumstances) but less than great bodily harm ie a &#8220;bodily injury which creates a high probability of death, or which causes serious permanent disfigurement, or which causes a permanent or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ or other serious bodily harm.&#8221;(first degree assault)</p>
<p>So significant bodily harm seems to roughly translate to a trip to the ER. </p>
<p>But Minnesota seems to in practice, contrary to the base reading of the law, define assaults by the injuries the act would normally cause, not the ones they actually cause, in the odd circumstances that they differ. Otherwise the shaken baby would be first degree assault, not third; shaking the baby ended up causing permeant organ damage. I would be interested in seeing more Minnesota jurisprudence on this point. Also if someone shoves a guy at the grocery store two feet in the middle of an aisle and this ends up blinding the other person, is the shover charged with first or fifth degree assault, or compromise absurdly on third degree. </p>
<p> Textually the interpretation where the charge is based on outcomes standard to the type of attack and not what actually resulted is incredibly weak. The laws say &#8220;Whoever assaults another and inflicts&#8230;. bodily harm&#8221; not &#8220;Whoever assaults another in a way that would typically inflict&#8221; but at the same time most people feel strongly that the type of action done by the criminal matters. So it would not be surprising if the law as intended and lived is more about what kind of injury would result normally result from the action. </p>
<p>If this is the case, if someone engages in some unjustifiable act of violence that would be prosecuted, but would normally not send someone to the ER that would not rise to the level of a third degree assault, even if it resulted in death. Because at base it would be a fifth degree assault not a third degree assault. So in very odd cases where aggressive and repeated shoving someone at the grocery store in a criminal manner that sets off a serious of incredibly unlucky events in the person&#8217;s death, it would be an assault ending in death, but it would not be felony murder and so another charge like third degree murder or manslaughter might be used.<br />
In State v. Stay, dealt with by the Minnesota Supreme Court in 2019 does not address this directly, but seems to assume that this is the case. Some one punched someone else once in the jaw and thereby killed him and was charged with fifth degree assault and manslaughter. This was a disagreement about the exact jury instructions for the manslaughter charge and the court ruled first degree manslaughter does not require the State to prove that death or great bodily harm was a reasonably foreseeable result when the underlying crime is fifth-degree assault. This case assume implies a single punch to the jaw from a normal person, that causes death, does not rise to the level of third degree assault.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Does anyone have experience with or thoughts about what I call the &#8216;draft approval problem&#8217;? I&#8217;m thinking mainly about creative commissions e.g. writing music, copywriting, making art or videos etc.</p>
<p>The problem is this: in many industries, putting the &#8216;polish&#8217; on a finished, professional piece of work requires many hours of work. This polish is what stops the work seeming amateurish and is a huge part of the finished aesthetic, and has a big impact on the gut-level instantaneous reaction that people have when they see or hear the work.</p>
<p>If you have a client commissioning work from you, you probably want to show the client &#8216;sketches&#8217;, works in progress, proofs of concept, drafts etc., to make sure you&#8217;re heading in the right direction before you commit the resources to polishing. They will probably insist on this, and even if they don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s probably a good idea so you don&#8217;t waste lots of time polishing a product they don&#8217;t want. In fact you often have to actually pitch these drafts of your creative work competitively on a tight budget and timeframe. </p>
<p>Often clients will dislike these proofs of concept because they just don&#8217;t feel the same as all the polished professional works the client is comparing them against. Even something that they would end up loving as a finished project gets rejected in the draft stage because it doesn&#8217;t feel right. </p>
<p>Solutions I&#8217;ve got so far:<br />
Find a cheap and easy way to imitate this level of polish when sending any kind of draft or pitch.<br />
Show examples of your previous polished work and try to explain how the process works (this rarely gets through.)<br />
Rely on some kind of reputation/prestige so you can effectively say &#8216;just leave it with me.&#8217;<br />
Don&#8217;t let clients hold the expectation that they can give prescriptive creative feedback on the work.<br />
Work with people who understand the art form and the process of creating it.</p>
<p>This is a long comment already, but as a concrete example: say I had to compose and produce a five-minute orchestral score for a film scene. The client sends it to me with a &#8216;reference track&#8217; they&#8217;ve been using during editing, which is a gorgeous, professionally-produced orchestral recording with a real orchestra, written by Hans Zimmer or something. They&#8217;ve watched the scene with this reference track literally hundreds of times. The client has seen my previous finished work, understands what&#8217;s achievable within their budget, and I&#8217;ve explained to them how the process works. Now I have to:<br />
1. Write the piece of music (maybe on piano or something, it depends.)<br />
2. Write the parts for all the different instruments and programme them in MIDI.<br />
3. Spend time polishing the MIDI programming to make it sound more human and less robotic.<br />
4. Schedule time in a recording studio and book professional musicians to perform certain key parts.<br />
5. Edit all of this and mix together all the recorded and MIDI parts so they blend nicely.<br />
6. Polish and refine the final combined audio so it&#8217;s at the right level, feels rich and full etc.</p>
<p>When and where do you send drafts? If I send them a draft at step 1 and a clear explanation of the above process, they&#8217;ll come back with &#8216;here&#8217;s a list of orchestral pieces, I want it more like these, with violins and timpanis and oboes and [Inception noise]&#8230;&#8221;. If I send a draft at step three with a clear explanation of the process they&#8217;ll freak out at the lack of human feel in the solo instruments (it just won&#8217;t feel right) and start questioning their decision to hire you. Often they won&#8217;t know exactly why they don&#8217;t like it, it just doesn&#8217;t feel like the Hans Zimmer score, so they&#8217;ll start giving prescriptive feedback on unrelated things and it&#8217;s back to step one. If you wait until step six to show them the work, there&#8217;s the distinct possibility they&#8217;ll watch their scene with your new track for the first time, and it won&#8217;t be the Hans Zimmer piece they&#8217;ve watched it with a hundred times, so it will feel catastrophically wrong to them even if it&#8217;s a great piece of work, and you&#8217;re back to step one.</p>
<p>Anyone with more experience than me want to share any anecdotes or tips?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>This is why creative agencies traditionally had to be at least somewhat deep-pocketed to go into business and creative individuals worked for them rather than for themselves &#8211; they could front the costs of polishing a pitch or a draft to make it impressive for the client, if you are a freelancer you need to manage your clients expectations preferably without taking them too deep into the sausage-making process and/or charge them accordingly.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I have no idea whether this would work, but: Suppose you take the nice polished Zimmer score and &#8220;un-polish&#8221; it. Figure out all the notes and then have it played by a MIDI synthesizer, or transcribe it for piano. And then you say to your client: OK, I&#8217;ve got some sketches for you, but they&#8217;re only sketches. For comparison&#8217;s sake, I&#8217;m going to play you how that Zimmer reference track would have sounded at this stage in production, and then I&#8217;ll play you mine.</p>
<p>Some reasons why it might not work: Un-polishing is probably quite a lot of work. The client may not trust your un-polishing and may blame its lack of polish on your (nonexistent) incompetence at un-polishing. The client, listening to the un-polished Zimmer, may have enough mental echoes of the original that it sounds better than it &#8220;should&#8221;.</p>
<p>(Also, for the avoidance of doubt: I am not &#8220;someone with more experience&#8221;, and in particular I have never tried this.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>And I hate that mainstream film music is like this now? It&#8217;s so galling when the insert songs are head and shoulders above the score, because the director just doesn&#8217;t let the composer to their thing. In contrast, anime composers often don&#8217;t get to see the animation at all, and the show ends up editing to the original tracks, which creates better synergy. </p>
<p>Even back in the day, the director for The Magnificent Seven said that he wished he could have had that great Elmer Bernstein theme available to him beforehand, and he would have shot/edited things to be even more spectacular to match the music. The Joker film benefited from having their main theme available on set. </p>
<p>I feel like editing should always be done to the draft track, instead of temp tracks.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If this is actually about music, have you tried checking out the vi-control forum?  A lot of the people there work in the film/video game music industry [edit: Hans Zimmer actually occasionally posts there, or used to, anyway], and it&#8217;s entirely dedicated to virtual instruments.  From what I understand, it&#8217;s pretty common for directors to hear midi mockups, although these can be pretty high quality.  For no reason other than I like sharing my work, as an amateur, here&#8217;s what I was able to do re-creating the Star Trek Picard theme by ear one afternoon: <a rel="nofollow"href="https://soundcloud.com/mpalenik/recreation-of-star-trek-picard-theme-song" rel="nofollow ugc">https://soundcloud.com/mpalenik/recreation-of-star-trek-picard-theme-song</a></p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ve been on the other side of this a few times; I don&#8217;t really have any advice other than to try to work for clients who have been in the same position you&#8217;re in. On the other hand, I&#8217;ve also been in the position of saying to myself &#8220;yeah, that&#8217;ll look great once he finishes it&#8221; and then the contractor comes back three days later with something that looks indistinguishable from the draft.</p>
<p>So far my best theory is that my job as a director is to trust that the guy I&#8217;m paying knows what he&#8217;s doing and cares about the finished product as much as I do, and not get <i>too</i> caught up in a &#8220;vision&#8221; to let the artist make his own decisions.</p>
<p>I think the <i>ideal</i> is to make sure it&#8217;s possible for the contractor to see his piece in something close to the final context, but that usually isn&#8217;t possible when you&#8217;ve got a time constraint.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>1. There&#8217;s an existing background level of anger and resentment at the government for perceived poor handling of the crisis. Especially to the extent where it has disproportionately harmed already disadvantaged groups. </p>
<p>	2. Lots of people are either unemployed or furloughed and so more willing and able to protest than they would be normally when it would mean taking time off work. Or use very limited free time. </p>
<p>	3. Lots of people are at home and glued to the internet and tv, so the viral effect of the original video, and footage of protests is going to be greater. Lots of people commenting and engaging in discussion of what&#8217;s happening.</p>

<p>I think this is really important. People are anxious for something to do and have no need to show up for work in the morning.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve previously fretted that if we had a UBI there would be nothing to stop the people with no jobs from protesting all day for more UBI, and now I&#8217;ve got pretty good evidence for that.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If you’re right that the protests are solely ‘against police violence’, then I’m probably wrong, except for perhaps the scale and extent of the protests. But isn’t there a palpable build up of frustration, anger, and anti-authority sentiment that has found an outlet? 40 million people suddenly unemployed? </p>
<p>If George Floyd’s death had occurred, say, a year ago, wouldn’t the reaction have been more like the Rodney King riots? I suppose my supposition is that the spread of the protests, and their intensity have a lot to do with lockdown fever, and are not just about police (racial) brutality.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Economic fallout from the lockdowns will have terrible effects. Civil unrest is one of those. War between the US and China, authoritarian governments around the world grabbing more power and doing terrible things, those things are possible too.</p>
<p>For example, the Treaty of Versailles had some bad effects on Germany&#8217;s economy, which led to all sorts of horrible things happening later. Bad economy is bad news: it increases the risk of the worst sorts of things happening.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p><i> What’s the connection between a a pandemic and responses to it, on the one hand, and violent protests against police violence, on the other?</i></p>
<p>The pandemic [<i>major aspects of it-EDIT</i>] and the violent protests are both alleged to be fabricated by authors featured at OffGuardian and LewRockwell, as well as by individuals such as Gonzalo Lira and Patrick Henningsen.  Names both from the Left and the Right. </p>
<p>Fabrication: motives? </p>
<p>We&#8217;re in a serious, systemic economic crisis. It is not uncommon for times of such crisis to appear diametrically opposed movements, one of decentralisation / disintegration, and another an attempt of an oligarchy or competing oligarchies to extend their control in a more or less totalitarian fashion.</p>
<p>Both feed on each other. </p>
<p>How can we determine what of the phenomena you asked about is a result of spontaneous disintegration, what a result of a conspiracy? &#8230; </p>
<p>For answering that question fairly, I sense I lack the conceptual apparatus.  I simply feel  more needs to be thought out here.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t really have a clear sense about how big any of these things are, but were both Occupy and the Tea Party in their 2010-2011 peak, as big as the current police violence protests? (Obviously neither was anywhere near as large as covid, but the last thing as big as covid was *maybe* the HIV situation of the &#8217;80s or the end of the cold war, but more likely World War II.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The part I don&#8217;t get about all of this is the demonstrations outside the US. Why demonstrate about police violence against black people in places where there basically are no black people in the first place, like the Netherlands? It&#8217;s not like demonstrations in Amsterdam are going to make the tiniest bit of difference to US policy makers.</p>
<p>Some people are just outrage junkies, I guess.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Dutch person here. </p>
<p>There are definitely black people in the Netherlands. There is definitely racial tension in the Netherlands. There are definitely issues with racial profiling by police (to the point of there being illegal &#8216;here&#8217;s how to do racial profiling&#8217; police manuals). </p>
<p>I think the biggest thing, though, is US-ian cultural infectiousness. We listen to US music, we cheer at the heroes in US blockbusters. We feel like we understand US issues and that US pain is our pain because we drink in US culture every day. People often say &#8216;Americans always forget that the US is not the whole world&#8217; but it&#8217;s definitely also true that non-Americans sometimes forget that the whole world is not the US. So we feel responsible to do something about it if things get out of hand over there.</p>
<p>Which is completely bonkers because the US really doesn&#8217;t give a damn about <i>us</i>.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Calling them outrage junkies is a bit unchariable.  </p>
<p>I suspect these people are legitimately outraged and want to do what they can, even if its direct impact is fairly minimal. But at the very least, it makes the US state look bad on an international level, encourages politicians outside the US to condemn the US and shows solidarity with American protestors.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>To our shame, Canada has some of the same issues with regard to black people as the US, enough so that there&#8217;s a Candian branch of Black Lives Matter. </p>
<p>Our treatment of black people is probably not the worst of our systemic racism &#8211; that&#8217;s reserved for &#8220;Indians&#8221; (aka indigenous Canadians), but we collectively do an even more thorough job of being unaware of it, and even congratulating ourselves for being better than the US.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>As most of you living in the US have probably noticed, this past week has been a particularly bad one in terms of overall social cohesion/national well-being.</p>
<p>I think it would be a mistake to overreact to this. The US has been through many ups and downs in its history, and so far we have always pulled through. And yet, it does feel like there is an overall trend towards increasing social and political dysfunction which has been present for at least the past five years. </p>
<p>In light of this trend, and the fact that I have not yet started a family/committed heavily to a particular geographical region, I’ve been considering what my other options would for establishing a permanent place of residence.</p>
<p>I would love to hear from other SSC readers based elsewhere around the world about how you view the long-term outlook of your own countries. I’m particularly interested in places where English is widely spoken; Canada, England, and Australia/New Zealand are my current shortlist of alternatives for this reason. But people from anywhere should feel free to weigh in.</p>
<p>Any thoughts you want to share are welcome, but I’d be particularly interested in 1) how politically competent/functional you feel your government is (independent of partisan affiliation), 2) what the educational system and job market are like, and 3) whether you feel that the culture of your country would be easy for an outsider to integrate into.</p>
<p>In other words, is the place you live somewhere you think other people should consider immigrating to? Is it an acceptable place to call home, but not anything that stands out on an international level? Or would you be thinking about leaving, were it not for the inertia of currently living there?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I live in Berlin, Germany. Been here for 8 years. English is widely spoken, there are plenty of well-paid jobs for skilled professionals, the government is well-run &amp; stable, and the quality of life is high-middle. It&#8217;s also a 1 &#8211; 4 hour flight away from Paris, London, Munich, Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, etc, so holidays to very different, interesting places are cheap &amp; easy. As far as the educational system goes I don&#8217;t have a lot of experience having been schooled elsewhere, but afaik the standard is very high, and also students don&#8217;t graduate with debilitating debt. </p>
<p>I can recommend at least adding it into the mix if you&#8217;re considering a sea change.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>For the purpose of living in political stability, I would advice against Berlin.

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Berlin has a pretty high percentage of left wing radicals, right wing radicals and foreigners. It seems to me the city in Germany that is most likely to have riots like the US right now. Which still doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s likely. </p>
<p>Munich is more prosperous and more conservative &#8211; probably more stable. It also has the Oktoberfest and the Alpes close by if you care for skiing or hiking. It&#8217;s getting ever more expensive to buy property though.</p>
<p>Having been to both and also knowing people who repatriated there &#8211; both Denmark and Switzerland would be top choices for emigration. Salaries are much higher than in Germany. Both basically top all the rankings. Switzerland would be my vote for the Western European country least likely to go up in flames in the next decades.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>During a global crisis one might not be able to avoid social and political dysfunction by moving to a new place and just staying in it. I have obtained EU citizenship and hope to use it to move between EU countries in case SHTF. Another option similar to EU is Mercosur but I can&#8217;t tell you much about it. If I had to bet everything on the stability of just one country, I&#8217;d pick Switzerland.</p>
<p>About English: look at <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language_in_Europe" rel="nofollow ugc">this</a>. But you&#8217;re likely to do well with just English in any sea or mountain resort. If you want to move out when SHTF, Australia and New Zealand are way too far in the drink, but maybe that&#8217;s just me.</p>
<p>If you want to migrate to EU, your number one problem is that it usually takes 5 years to long-term residence permit (compared to, say, 1 year in Chile). If you&#8217;re fired before those 5 years are over, you&#8217;re kicked out. If you can get a Blue Card, you can collect those 5 years in different EU countries, plus you get some grace period to find a new job (3 months, I believe). If you want to optimize for getting the BC, you&#8217;ll probably land in Germany&#8230; but maybe not, depends on your profession. A good path is German BC to German long-term residence which takes 21 months if you pass a German exam on B1 level.</p>
<p>Also interesting: Portugal is the only country in EU where you can apply for a visa inside the country and not in your current place of residence. Sweden doesn&#8217;t require a language exam to get the citizenship.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>First, all of your infrastructure is sized for the old population, and all of its maintenance costs are thus sized to its old population.  Not all of this will fail gracefully as you cut back on the maintenance work.  &#8220;Hey, it&#8217;s wicked cool that there&#8217;s no more traffic and I can commute at 120 kph!&#8221;, turns into &#8220;where did that pothole come from and how can it cost so much to repair my car when all I did was hit a pothole (at 120 kph)?&#8221;</p>
<p>Second, during the transitional period (and if you&#8217;re reading this, you won&#8217;t live long enough to see anything but the transitional period) you may have the same <i>number</i> of people that you did 20-30 years ago but the age structure will be skewed heavily towards retirees and away from workers.  So, significantly lower per-capita GDP coupled with significantly higher per-capita demand for e.g. health care and assisted living.  Exactly who that screws over and how is somewhat negotiable, but probably not safe to assume that every other demographic group will take the hit so that you don&#8217;t have to.  </p>
<p>And the easiest people to offload the costs to and grab the benefits from are going to be immigrants, if you were thinking of being one.</p>

<p>The age structure will be skewed towards retirees and away from <i>children</i>, assuming that the current trend continues. The worker:dependent ratio won&#8217;t be as low as much as if you only considered the workers and the retirees but not the children.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s compared to the situation where the population is stable. Compared to the current situation, the worker:dependent ratio will indeed significantly decline, as the worker:child ratio is already high, and it probably won&#8217;t grow much further.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Compared to the current situation, the worker:dependent ratio will indeed significantly decline, as the worker:child ratio is already high, and it probably won’t grow much further.</p></blockquote>
<p>Looking at Poland&#8217;s population pyramid for <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.populationpyramid.net/poland/2020/" rel="nofollow ugc">2020</a>, compared to that expected in <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.populationpyramid.net/poland/2050/" rel="nofollow ugc">2050</a>, I get a worker:dependent ratio decreasing from 1.60 today to 1.06 thirty years from now.  That seems to me quite substantial.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s assuming we treat children and retirees equally, which is not really right.  Children are almost certainly cheaper to care for than the elderly &#8211; they are smaller, eat less, can sleep two to a bedroom in their parents&#8217;s homes, have much smaller health-care requirements, and the teacher:student ratio in primary and secondary schools is I think quite a bit smaller than the caregiver:resident ratio in retirement and nursing homes.</p>
<p>If I simplistically assume that the average child costs half as much to care for as the average adult, the effective worker:dependant ratio now shifts from 2.15 today to 1.29 in 2050 &#8211; a 40% reduction.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Demographic collapse is a bad thing because you get an inverted population pyramid, with lots of old folks who have to be supported by a relatively small number of working young people. That&#8217;s a crappy deal for the young. (Or it&#8217;s a crappy deal for the old, if you decide you&#8217;d rather leave them without support.)</p>
<p>More controversially, if you try to counter the demographic collapse of the population pyramid by immigration, you are going to see substantial cultural changes. If you have just a few immigrants, they&#8217;ll generally assimilate, because there isn&#8217;t any real choice. But the more you have of them, to more they&#8217;ll retain their original culture, shifting the culture of their new country. Many people are ok with some of this; not a lot of people are ok with lots of this.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Its not an issue of &#8216;we have to much stuff sitting around&#8217; its a &#8216;we have a bunch of stuff declining in value and a bunch of new needs for this segment of the population who cannot provide them for themselves&#8217;.  When agriculture was still manual it took 10 people working in agriculture to earn enough surplus to feed one person not working in agriculture so that they could specialize in something else, and this set up makes technological progress very slow (even in agriculture!).  Aging populations are going to bring that type of problem back to the forefront, if 1/3rd of your population is retired and the rest of society is paying for them at a 5:1 ratio (ie one worker is supporting 5 retired people) you still have almost 40% of your population accounted for, add in say 15% of the population under productive age, plus supporting them and you are almost at 60% of your population accounted for (which you can probably round to above 60 with some level of disabilities/incarceration) before you get into the &#8216;supporting ourselves plus maintaining all the old capital plus making progress moving forward&#8217; section of society.  </p>
<p>And 5:1 is way to generous of a ratio, that is more along the lines of what you can do raising kids not caring for people in declining health.  Keyenes pretty much summed it up when he said (paraphrasing) &#8216;In the long run we are all dead, who cares if our great grand-kids suddenly find themselves heavily indebted with no route toward growth.&#8217;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p> So a nation winds up going back to the population they had 20-30 years ago.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is not a problem. Problem is with an aging population.</p>
<p>Median age of population reaching 51 by 2050 will collapse social benefits &#8211; healthcare, pensions and everything else.</p>
<p>To repeat: with current trends over half of population will be over 51.</p>
<p>What worse things will not decline but rather collapse &#8211; Poland already delayed retirement age, next government rolled it back under the pressure. And as population gets older retires will be a bigger and bigger voting block ensuring that nothing can be rolled back. And sooner or later things will collapse.</p>
<p>So I expect things slowly getting worse and exploding dramatically around my own retirement age.</p>
<p>Not sure what I should do with that knowledge.</p>
<blockquote><p>it hearkens back to 20th Century thinking where manpower was everything in war and economic growth was all about the hands you had to work.</p></blockquote>
<p>It reduces problem and is an ongoing trend, but I am skeptical about process being fast enough to avoid explosion/collapse. In the best case it will be probably something along lines of &#8220;at least retires have enough money to avoid starvation and there is a limited healthcare&#8221;.</p>
<p>But I expect that by 2050 economy will not be completely independent from number of workers &#8211; and technology will remain a growing multiplier of number of employees.</p>
<p>&#8220;20% of population is working&#8221; will remain worse case than &#8220;50% of population is working&#8221;, like it is today &#8211; despite that technology is an enormous multiplier.</p>
<p>It is no longer necessary for 75% of population to work as farmers, just to keep as from starving. But a single working employee is unable to keep entire USA population alive in case where noone else works.</p>
<p>Not sure about the exact % of workers is necessary for a comfortable life, and what it will be in 2050 &#8211; but I expect that in 2050 Poland will be below it.</p>
<p>Oversized infrastructure mentioned in one comment seems to not be a major problem, just stop maintaining part of it.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Disclaimer: maybe something will save us like ridiculous technology progress, or Ukraine will emigrate into Poland without massive cultural issues or something else.</p>
<p>Or we will have bigger problem like getting invaded by Russia again (or Germany)/global warming and environment decline will turn out to be actually catastrophic/AI will eat us/nuclear war will happen/plague on Black Death levels/other less likely x-risk like catastrophic solar storm or major impact event will happen.</p>
<p>But overall &#8211; either hilariously fast technology progress or something even worse or successful immigration or Poland will have extremely aged population with major issues coming from that.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I live in the Netherlands. English is very widely spoken (as a second language, but 95% of people are fluent). I&#8217;m writing this from the perspective of an expat/immigrant/so-called &#8216;kennismigrant&#8217; (knowledge migrant), but one who lives outside the Randstad conurbation where most such people live. I know there are other posters who are native to the Netherlands, so it might be interesting to hear their point of view.</p>
<p>The government seems broadly competent and functional, certainly by the standards of anywhere else I&#8217;m familiar with. People talk about the &#8221;polder model&#8221; of consensus-based decision making, and politics does seem much less aggressively partisan than in the US or UK- the electoral system is designed to produce multi-party coalition governments. If I could vote here I wouldn&#8217;t vote for the party that the current PM belongs to, or for any of his coalition partners (except maybe one of them), but I think they are generally doing a good job.</p>
<p>The education system, again, seems to perform fairly well- it&#8217;s more similar to the German system than to the US one. Unlike Germany student debt is a thing, but much lower than in the US- for locals, tuition fees are around €2000 a year. The top universities compare favourably to those in the US- TU Delft is between Carnegie-Mellon and Brown in the world rankings.</p>
<p>The job market seems pretty good (I&#8217;m a scientist so in a weird separate market), and if you&#8217;re working in the Randstad or in tech or academia language isn&#8217;t necessarily an issue. I would advise learning some Dutch as it makes things a bit easier (and is more polite), but expect people to hear your halting Dutch and immediately switch to English. </p>
<p>Integration is a tricky one. Many expats have complained that the Dutch are friendly but that it&#8217;s difficult to properly become part of a group of friends, so it&#8217;s common to end up in a &#8221;bubble&#8221; of other non-Dutch people. The best way to avoid this is to find a club for some kind of sport, hobby or interest.</p>
<p>As with Berlin, it&#8217;s very close (by air or high-speed train) to many other interesting places- a weekend in Paris, London or Vienna is trivial. </p>
<p>In general, I really like living here- there is a general sense that things &#8216;just work&#8217; in a way they don&#8217;t in the UK where I grew up or in the US where I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time. I would recommend seriously considering it as a place to move.</p>
<p>(Another note for Americans- if you are the sort to set up your own business, the Dutch-American Friendship Treaty might make getting a visa easier.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If you&#8217;re from the US, moving to Canada would pose virtually no cultural hurdle at all, and particularly so if you are from the northern US. If there&#8217;s a cultural difference between Seattle and Vancouver, I just don&#8217;t see it. You might notice some differences if you&#8217;re from the US Bible Belt.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that Canada is a smaller, somewhat poorer, and less economically competitive place. And it shows in the high-end jobs that are available, and how much they pay. If you&#8217;re used to high-flying New York or San Francisco pay scales, you&#8217;re going to find Toronto quite a step down.</p>
<p>Finally, think carefully before committing to Toronto or Vancouver. Both cities are among the most <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.rcinet.ca/en/2020/01/23/toronto-climbs-on-world-list-of-expensive-cities-vancouver-still-number-2/" rel="nofollow ugc">unaffordable</a> in the world.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>This makes sense and is consistent with my current thinking about Canada (though I didn&#8217;t realize that salaries were such a step down from the major US economic hubs).</p>
<p>Do you have any recommendations for specific cities/regions in Canada to consider? Toronto and Vancouver are the first two that come to mind for me, so if we are excluding those on the basis of cost-of-living, what would be your next choice? Is it better to just work down the list in order of population (so look at Calgary/Edmonton), or are there other areas that might strike a sweet spot between the conveniences of being population centers and the affordability of being in the countryside?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I personally work in tech, and was actually already working remotely before the pandemic started. So I&#8217;m not really worried at all about the difficulty of finding a job for myself.</p>
<p>My main concern is finding a place that seems like it will afford convenience and opportunity to my future family. So even though I would be perfectly fine working from a mountain town as long as it had reasonably fast internet, I would prefer to raise a family in a city large enough that it has good schools for my children and a reasonable breadth of job opportunities for them if they don&#8217;t end up in an industry as geographically flexible as tech. That being said, it also seems plausible that remote work will be much more common in all industries thirty years from now, so perhaps this is a moot point.</p>
<p>Also, on the topic of the big Canadian cities &#8211; how far outside of Vancouver does the housing bubble extend? Would suburbs 40 minutes from the city center still be quite expensive? And does Vancouver suffer from high cost-of-living generally, or is it really just housing that is abnormally expensive?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Let me suggest you consider Kitchener-Waterloo. It&#8217;s a smaller center, with a metro population of about half a million. It&#8217;s a bit more than an hour from Toronto, which is convenient when you need stuff only a truly  big city provides, but much cheaper. The University of Waterloo, a major Canadian technical university is local. There are two high-performing local high schools: Sir John A. Macdonald and Waterloo C.I.. The main Canadian lab of Google is there, as are Open Text and what&#8217;s left of RIM. There are quite a few  other local high-tech companies, too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a bit biased, since I grew up there.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Ottawa should also be on the list of reasonable Canadian cities for techies, IMO, but I may be biased because it&#8217;s the last place  lived before moving to the US, and the top of my list of Canadian cities to move to if I decide not to retire in place after all.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Salaries are not the be all, end all, you have to also consider the cost of living.<br />
Generally speaking, southern Germany has a very strong combination of good wages and low unavoidable expenses. You will pay more taxes, but much less in health insurance, rent is low and cars are affordable, however, also not a very English-speaking only friendly place at all, so if you do not think you can pick up German in fairly short order, no. Berlin is far better about the language, but rents are quite atrocious by German standards.<br />
Any of the nordic countries will see you paid well, but not outrageously, health costs are just.. not a thing, and taxes sting. Quite a bit. Finland is very strongly recommended if you want to start a family on grounds of having the best educational system in the world. All are quite navigable in English. </p>
<p>Southern europe is very cheap if you can secure a job there that pays international rates, and the food and climate are fantastic. If you expect to earn an average-for-a-local-professional wage, uhm. No.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Norway?  Low crime, high trust. Some racial tension in Oslo, but I can&#8217;t really see anybody looting and pillaging.</p>
<blockquote><p>1) how politically competent/functional you feel your government is (independent of partisan affiliation),
</p></blockquote>
<p>Quite competent and functional, with a very narrow spectrum of opinion &#8211; basically a cluster of centrist parties with a set of special interest parties (agriculture, the greens, the social liberals, christian democrats) trying to pull in different directions.  The far left party can&#8217;t quite decide if they are communist or not, and has a single delegate, the far right is bigger, but want to have less road tolls and more restrictive immigration.</p>
<blockquote><p>2) what the educational system and job market are like, and
</p></blockquote>
<p>Education is all right, I think.  I mean, everybody complains about how their nation is doing, we&#8217;re also like that.  Schools are public and &#8211; like everything else &#8211; fairly egalitarian.  Universities and the large majority of other higher education have free tuition.</p>
<p>Job market is okay (depends on your skills, I would think), with good job protection, holidays, and other benefits, but salary levels will likely be much lower for skilled specialists than elsewhere &#8211; especially urban US.  Few people will collect more than $100K in wages.</p>
<blockquote><p>3) whether you feel that the culture of your country would be easy for an outsider to integrate into.</p></blockquote>
<p>Moderately?  Practically everybody speaks English (maybe a bit less so than the Dutch, but better than Germans), people can seem a bit unfriendly to strangers, especially to people from more socially forward cultures (southern Europe, say).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My friend told me about Newcomb’s problem a few months ago. We were both struck by how strong our initial judgments were: I immediately thought that two-boxing was the way to go, and she thought that one-boxing was obviously right. So it seems like my instinctive way of thinking is along the lines of causal decision theory, while hers is evidential. (I’ve been reading a bit about timeless decision theory, but I don’t grok it yet.) And it made us wonder whether one- or two-boxing correlates with anything else in terms of personality, etc. (Which reminds me of optical illusions, a bit: a lot of illusions are experienced similarly by everyone, but there are some that people differ on according to other characteristics, like how whether you saw “the dress” as blue/black or white/gold was apparently affected by whether you expected it to be in light or in shadow from the ambiguous cues in the picture, which in turn had to do with whether you were a night owl.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I never quite understood the two-boxers.  To me it seems obvious that reflection on the newcomb problem will cause me to be a one-boxer which in turn will cause both the predictor to put the higher reward as well as me choosing to one-box.  This seems to me like a perfect causal desicion.</p>
<p>In order to two-box you must somehow believe that while everything else is part of a purely causal chain of events your own choice somehow is not?  So maybe two-boxers at least subconsciously just have some believe in some notion of &#8220;free will&#8221;?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m a one-boxer too, but to put a word for the other side&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>To me it seems obvious that reflection on the newcomb problem will cause me to be a one-boxer which in turn will cause both the predictor to put the higher reward as well as me choosing to one-box.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this reflection done before or after the predictor sets up the boxes? If after, this reflection cannot &#8220;cause the predictor to put the higher reward&#8221; because it happens after the rewards are set. If before, well, yes, if you can credibly precommit to one-box then of course you should, but this is not the interesting question. The interesting question is, what should someone do if put in front of the two boxes and explained the situation without ever having heard of the Newcomb problem beforehand?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That changes nothing as the reflection is also a causal event.  My point is that a causal decision agent will choose to one-box as long as they don&#8217;t take their choice as an independent root cause but merely as a point in a causal chain of events that can both cause the prediction and the concious choice.</p>
<p>If you remove that causal part from the prediction you are no longer posing an interesting problem since the real world is always causal and that&#8217;s the only way we can reason about it.  Only of course if we don&#8217;t know the involved causation we have to think probabilistical.  In that case there is some cut off where two-boxing becomes the correct choice but that&#8217;s no longer the original newcomb problem.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@cathray:<br />
Does your reflection include a term for &#8220;the predictor is lying to me&#8221;?</p>
<p>One-boxing offers the superior payoff if there is, in fact, money in the opaque box. This pre-condition may fail to be met if:<br />
a. Omega incorrectly predicts you to be a <strike>one</strike> two-boxer (IOW pegs you as a two-boxer when you would have picked the one), or<br />
b. Omega lied to you and had no intention of putting money in the box in the first place.</p>
<p>One-boxing is only obvious if you assume that Omega is both honest and a perfect predictor. Neither of these assumptions is demonstrated inductively in the real world, nor does there exist a deductive line of reasoning that allows us to arrive at that conclusion.</p>
<p>ETA:<br />
Absent the perfect prediction/perfect honesty assumptions, two-boxing offers the option of the greatest possible payoff (if Omega got the prediction wrong) and in the worst case you still get $1000.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If the predictor can err or lie there is a probabilistic component to the desicion and you should choose the higher expected value which depends on the rewards offered and the probability of error/lie.</p>
<p>This however is not the original newcomb problem and it is also a combined problem that will still involve the causal reasoning that leads to one-boxing if the probability of a correct prediction and/or reward are high enough.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Agreed that Newcomb&#8217;s original formulation doesn&#8217;t include a probabilistic component, but that just makes it a not very interesting problem.</p>
<p>The EV cutoff point, if I did my sums right, is at P(money in opaque box) = 0.5, so one-boxing means that you assume it&#8217;s more likely than not that there will be money in the box (consistent with a naive interpretation).</p>
<p>The interesting question is therefore: why would you believe there&#8217;s money in the box?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The only way a predictor can reliably predict the future is to faithfully simulate it.  The simulated copy of you it&#8217;s simulating will feel just like you.  Thus, when you come upon the two boxes, there is no way to know if it&#8217;s inside a simulation or not.  Your choice inside the simulation is what causes the boxes to be what they are outside the simulation.  The correct decision is to one-box.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>How does the predictor have access to all of my memories?  How does it know my brain structure?  How does it have the resources to simulate me and enough of my immediate environment for me to not notice I&#8217;m in a simulation?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Isn&#8217;t it the other way around?</p>
<p>If you accept the predictor never mispredicts, we can simplify the thought experiment to &#8220;would you rather have a million or a thousand dollars?&#8221; which isn&#8217;t much of a question.</p>
<p>If the predictor never mispredicts, the scenario is equivalent to the predictor saying &#8220;if you choose one box I will put $1,000,000 it and if you choose two, I will put no money in the second box&#8221;. You can achieve exactly the same result with postdiction (hindsight is always 20-20) as with (assumed) perfect prediction, so I fail to see what assuming prediction brings to the table here.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think the fundamental issue is that Newcomb&#8217;s paradox can&#8217;t be formalized in the usual language of mathematics and game theory. It&#8217;s a bit like trolleyology, where the entire argument rests in people debating their imagined views of various scenarios that resemble the problem statement, and thus there is considerable disagreement.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I can reliably predict the future without doing any sort of detailed simulation. You don&#8217;t need anything more than about 55% reliability in order to make one-boxers do better than two-boxers, and many people can get 55% reliability. (I think I heard that Dave Chalmers did this at his 42nd birthday party &#8211; he was well above 60% accuracy on the friends he invited to the party. I don&#8217;t think the payouts were in thousands or millions of dollars though.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>For Newcombs Paradox, you aren&#8217;t predicting some generic event. You&#8217;re predicting the behavior of someone who is making different decisions based on their prediction of what you predict.

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Being a reliable one-boxer and then moving on with your life gets you a million bucks. Who risks that?</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem is that it&#8217;s not enough to be a reliable one-boxer. You also have to be able to rely on the opponent thinking you are a reliable one-boxer. Like I said, even a small amount of fallibility makes the paradox break down. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit like a variation of the prisoner&#8217;s dilemma where the opponent commits to cooperate if you cooperate. Sure the &#8220;obvious&#8221; strategy is to always cooperate, but if you can&#8217;t be sure they&#8217;re actually telling the truth, the &#8220;obvious&#8221; strategy is no longer quite so obvious.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>When I first heard Newcomb&#8217;s problem I was an instinctive one-boxer and couldn&#8217;t understand the two-box position. Causes usually come before effects, but I&#8217;m being asked for the sake of the thought experiment to assume that this one effect comes before its cause. Anyone two-boxing seemed to me to be rejecting the premise.</p>
<p>Later I read EY&#8217;s paper on timeless decision theory and while I do not understand TDT at all the paper did give me a much better grasp on the Newcomb problem. Presenting the problem in a statistical way alongside the counter-example of chewing gum and tobacco helped me see the flaws in one-box logic and understand why it&#8217;s such an interesting thought experiment. I often find that I fail to learn the main thesis or central argument of things I read, but incidentally get a much better understanding of the more fundamental or background issues they&#8217;re trying to address.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I find that working part time is dramatically better for my mental health and general well being. Being unemployed leaves me rudderless and adrift, days blur into each other as meals and media consumption fill the desperate need to pass time. Working full time though, takes so much energy, so many spoons, that ever free moment is similarly devoted to mindless pleasures. Part time employment, shines through like a beacon of hope. A consistent pillar around which my life might be tethered, the routine and structure giving each day distinction, and the obligation keeps me moving. At the same time, I am left with the energy to pursue my hobbies, to fill my free time with more productive activities. </p>
<p>So, my question SSC, what are the best long term options for part time employment?</p>
<p>I have a bachelors degree in general studies(my life is a comedy of errors), a very cheap lifestyle in general, but I am not sure if I can live cheaply enough on the kinds of part time jobs that I am aware of to afford housing.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I have the same opinions about ideal employment. I&#8217;m currently working a full time engineering job. It&#8217;s an extremely good fit as full time jobs go (they allow flexible schedules and have provided disability accommodations on more than one occasion) but the fact that it&#8217;s 40 hours per week is still super draining. My ideal would be more like 30-35. </p>
<p>As for part time work&#8230;<br />
I had a lot of fun in my 5 years of working in public libraries. The public itself can be a crapshoot depending on location, but the coworkers and environment make up for it. I&#8217;ve never met a librarian who wasn&#8217;t interesting. Unfortunately, the pay is not great. And, at least in my region, opportunities for advancement without a masters degree started drying up about 3-5 years ago, which is a big factor in why I switched careers. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m curious to see what other people will suggest. My biggest issue with part time jobs was the lack of  Healthcare. YMMV if you live in a state that expanded Medicaid coverage.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Freelance work of various types is good for that, though you need to spend some time on getting work on top of the work itself. I&#8217;ve found tutoring or private teaching a good option, you can arrange a couple of sessions, each of an hour or two, at regular times a week with different clients. Lot of people doing them online right now as well as you&#8217;d imagine, so possible too work from home. Freelance writing is another option, but there&#8217;s a lot of competition and its harder to get regular gigs. Things like art and design, or progamming, also work that way, but i have less personal experience with them</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Seems like most freelance workers practically end up doing more than 40 hours a week, though. Hustle/gig economy and all that. It ends up borking your chances at a stable socializing schedule, too. You can&#8217;t commit to any non-work commitments because a gig opportunity could come up.</p>
<p>And most all of the professional book writers have strong financial support from someone else like a spouse or a patron.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ve been able to find part time work pretty consistently on a remote contract basis.</p>
<p>But personally, if I were you, I&#8217;d start from the goal and work backward. You say you have a pretty cheap lifestyle. The average household has (post-tax) $50k a year, so let&#8217;s say your lifestyle plus savings etc costs you $3k a month. That means about $3.6k in earnings due to taxes. You want to work 1,000 hours a year (50 weeks at twenty hours, plus two vacation weeks). This works out to a job that pays about $44 an hour, more if you want to factor in benefits (which you almost certainly won&#8217;t receive).</p>
<p>Okay, what do you like to do that you can earn $44/hour at? Well, there&#8217;s a bunch of web professions if that interests you. But there&#8217;s also plenty of other jobs. Google $40/hour or $45/hour jobs and you&#8217;ll find lists. Then you just need to build a career in one of those spaces and you&#8217;re golden. (I could give more advice in that direction but only once you&#8217;ve decided on a path.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Consider nomadic lifestyle to reduce costs even further. Rent in resorts is usually very cheap off-season since there&#8217;s a lot of empty housing. Check out <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/gmaps.jsp" rel="nofollow ugc">the cost of living map</a>.</p>
<p>Example: chilly summers in the mountain resort Bansko (also: <a rel="nofollow"href="https://banskonomadfest.com/" rel="nofollow ugc">Bansko Nomad Fest</a> for socialization), warm winters on the coast of Montenegro, springs and autumns in Budapest in apartments rented for 9 months (might be cheaper and easier than to rent for 3 months twice); Serbia for extra days necessary to make visas work.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Are you willing to work full time for a while with part time as an goal, or are you looking for something part time immediately?  I have a bunch of brainstormed ideas below, mostly unconnected to each other, except most of them need some up front work to get going.</p>
<p>The way I&#8217;ve seen people get decent part time jobs in the corporate world is by working full time long enough to prove their skills and earn trust, then negotiate reduction to half time.  It ends up being somewhat more precarious than a full time role since if the employer can get by without you half the time, they probably can get by without you all the time, but it can work.  </p>
<p>If you find a full time job with the right benefits package, you can convert it into a hybrid.  I have a coworker who uses his generous vacation allowance to take off every Friday, rather than the traditional approach.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you aim for an independent contracting type job like Alkatyn suggests.  Building up a client base and your own processes/accounting/etc will likely be full time at first, but once you have loyal customers you&#8217;re keeping happy, you can likely back down.  Anything where a customer would typically expect to be non-exclusive: landscaping, house cleaning, a trade, book keeping, tutoring.  Then you control your own hours by controlling the number of clients you accept.</p>
<p>Connected with this idea: enough of a nest egg to cover housing is rather less than you need to cover all expenses.  Maybe you can buy and pay off a house or build investments that cover rent in the first few years of full time work, then back off.  If you go for something entrepreneurial, you&#8217;ll likely be happier to have money in the bank anyway to smooth disruptions.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s mostly about energy/spoons, maybe you could consider something full time but only sporadically your full attention: security guard, receptionist, hotel clerk, or something routine like factory work where your body will be busy but you can let your mind wander while you work?  There are a lot of jobs routine enough that they become low stress once you know what you&#8217;re doing, where the employer is mostly paying for you to cover a shift rather than produce X amount.  Some jobs even let you work on hobbies from your desk, as long as it&#8217;s something you can drop the instant a customer walks through the door.</p>
<p>Are any of your hobbies marketable?  Can you mentally bucket 10-20 hours a week in &#8216;business stuff&#8217; as your job, turning your hobby products into money, or would they bleed together in your mind and prevent the hobby from being fun?</p>
<p>Not entirely under your control, but there&#8217;s often the &#8220;MRS degree&#8221; option.  Many people are happy to have a partner who keeps up the home, works a bit but isn&#8217;t the primary breadwinner.  This one is contingent on finding that relationship, of course.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I thought of a couple more:<br />
You could aim for a teaching role, in a subject like PE or music, where you&#8217;re not expected to assign or grade very much.  Or substitute teaching, or teacher&#8217;s aide,  librarian, admin: something where you actually work only during school hours.  Even school janitor might fit.</p>
<p>Depending on your personality, maybe something in sales?  Realtor, insurance, cars &#8211; sometimes you&#8217;ll find an employer who puts a lot of pressure on, but I think it ought to be possible to find someone who pays only commission, which ought to scale pretty well up or down with the amount of time you&#8217;re willing to put in.</p>
