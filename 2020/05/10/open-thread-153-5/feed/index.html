Ya. I think people like to talk about the rounding errors and ignore the majority. 

If you watch a Chinese show then the girl who&#039;d be a page-3 girl in the UK is considered way less attractive than the hyper-thin waif.

There is definitely some difference between societies and the &quot;ideal&quot; weight seems to  vary quite a lot between societies from fairly overweight to fairly underweight. 

But then people tend to extend that principle to try to argue that it applies to everything when it seems apparent it really does not.]]></description>

@albatross11 says: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;...works well if you can change masks often, but not if you have to keep reusing the same disposable N95 mask every day for a month, and maybe occasionally try sterilizing it by putting it in a 160 degree F oven for 30 minutes. Among other things, your breath makes it damp and warm, which leads to things growing in/on it and makes it smell bad&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt; At my job we&#039;re required to wear the masks anytime we get passed the shop near the boiler room, but we&#039;re rationed to no more than one N95 mask a week (sometimes we have to wait even longer). Mine usually start to stink within four hours and if I don&#039;t hide in a closet and do any actual work they usually become visibly dirty before the end of the day, much less a week.

I keep all my old ones and rotate based on how stinky and dirty looking they are.]]></description>

Stream of consciousness of things they&#039;re missing because they&#039;re not thinking like a rightist.

-They broadly compare the use of 1001 to general use against the public. The guest even says, &quot;Yes, I think there are problems with general use against the public,&quot; but focuses more on, &quot;I bet the gov&#039;t won&#039;t take this approach in any other case.&quot; Well, unfortunately, that runs pretty hard into &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/05/06/open-thread-153-25/#comment-894607&quot;&gt;the principles they used for applying 1001 in other high profile cases&lt;/a&gt;. It reeks of, &quot;Rules for thee, but not for me.&quot;

-They buy McCord&#039;s argument that there is predication due to &quot;Flynn lying publicly&quot; and waving toward possible blackmail, but that&#039;s not actually what they have evidence for. It&#039;s known that &lt;i&gt;VPOTUS&lt;/i&gt; said something that was not true; it is &lt;i&gt;assumed&lt;/i&gt; that Flynn lied to VPOTUS and VPOTUS was repeating that lie. Fact is, politicians lie to the public. I don&#039;t like it, but we don&#039;t &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; treat those things like grounds for prosecution. It is entirely plausible that Flynn told VPOTUS the truth, and the two of them got together and said, &quot;Here&#039;s the story we&#039;re going to roll with in public, because of political reasons.&quot; I don&#039;t like it, but I know that all politicians on both sides almost certainly do these things sometimes, and I don&#039;t want the FBI basing barely-credibly, seemingly politically-motivated prosecutions on this type of thing. The time had long passed for them to provide defensive briefings to the WH and wash their hands of it - and many many officials have been on record saying that such a thing would have been the normal course of events in any other administration. On top of that, there&#039;s still a gap (thanks Conrad for pointing this out). After Jan 4 (when they were going to close the investigation, but learned of his conversation with Kislyak), it was almost two weeks before VPOTUS publicly stated the falsehood. I don&#039;t think anyone has put forth a worthwhile rationale (stipulating that Logan Act don&#039;t count) for why that conversation was evidence in their investigation that he was an agent of the Russian government.

-Unlike some on r/law, I have little problems with amicus briefs. I know they&#039;re not a party to the case, but I understand how non-party equities can sometimes be important. That said, the guest&#039;s spin on this is that the judge is using this as an opportunity to get at the motives of the gov&#039;t behind &lt;i&gt;this filing&lt;/i&gt;. It smacks of, &quot;When I do something, we appeal to the idealized principles and most minimal requirements for what I&#039;m allowed to do, but when my opponents do something, it has to be pretext for bad motivations and we can&#039;t let bad motivations stand.&quot; This is why there was a lot of haranguing about this in the immigration EO SCOTUS case - you can&#039;t have the public perception be that &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; politicians aren&#039;t allowed to do the same things that any other politician can do &lt;i&gt;because we think they&#039;re a bad person doing things for bad reasons in their heart&lt;/i&gt;. Nobody is ever going to seriously suggest that anyone should use their power to look into possible bad motivations behind any previous filing against Flynn.

-They sort of skip over the &quot;why wasn&#039;t this charged&quot;. Didn&#039;t give even a moment to, &quot;Why wasn&#039;t the nonprosection agreement specifically-stated, as is required?&quot; If that was indeed part of the deal, then it needs to be part of the public record. (They later discuss how future governments may wiggle out, broaden the scope, and prosecute directly on FARA even if this is dismissed with prejudice. It reeks of the fact that they didn&#039;t do this one properly. And in any event, I don&#039;t think they said &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; about kidnapping at all (which was subject to prior discussion here); just an op-ed saying that he (the Turkish gov&#039;t) thought it was good policy to extradite the guy. I think that&#039;s about right for credibility on the kidnapping accusations - not even mentioned.

-Concerning the entire Trump/Russia thing, I was always of the standpoint, &quot;There are some potentially problematic things here, and they could even be &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; bad, but it&#039;s also possible that everyone comes out okay and some things just sound bad.&quot; Turns out the latter was true. But it&#039;s the small things when you realize that people still can&#039;t acknowledge that. Like where he says that Flynn&#039;s cooperation didn&#039;t give them Trump in the way they were hoping for - he insinuates that if only Flynn had &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; cooperated, Trump would surely be finished this time. When the reality is probably that the dude cooperated and gave up what he had... but there just wasn&#039;t anything there. (I just hit play again after writing this, and it&#039;s comical to hear him go on to say that prosecutors need to be careful to avoid seeming like they&#039;re trying to coerce specific testimony against a specific person, but it never quite hits his brain that maybe that &lt;i&gt;really was&lt;/i&gt; what was going on and that Flynn just didn&#039;t actually have the goods on Trump.)]]></description>

It sounds like you want early retirement. Coding could be a good path. I think one of the guys in my shop was a construction worker until he picked up coding in his 40s. Another good one could be the trades. I think it&#039;s something like 80% of electricians in the US are over 50 or something. They get good pay that gets better with time, there&#039;s demand, and potential to start your own business.

I would avoid any sort of schooling that you can&#039;t do part time, or that will take more than 2 years to complete full time. I would avoid trying for fields that seem particularly &quot;cool&quot; (don&#039;t try to be a Hollywood actor, for instance). Just look for a good-paying, stable job market, and then learn the skills to compete in it.

And *then* set your sights on the coolest, sexiest, most dream-fulfilling job in that market, and tailor your skills to be &lt;i&gt;the best person for that job in the whole goddamned world.&lt;/i&gt; This will include gaining the relevant skills *and* proving your worth by being an effective worker in other jobs. The trick being that you might not ever get that dream job, but (a) it focuses you on the skills you need to learn, instead of having too many choices and learning nothing and (b) the experience you gain pursuing it will set you up to take on higher-paying, more comfortable, more rewarding jobs in the future.]]></description>

I have to say, this approach has never worked for me, despite the fact that it seems like a constant refrain in the programming world.

What happens is I come up with my neat idea, and sit down to execute. But then I have trouble installing the software - the dependency tree is broken due to the latest push someone made to github in some low-level repo. Well fuck, that took 5 hours. Ok, now let&#039;s actually start - what&#039;s the simplest thing I can think of... 

3 iterations of making the simplest thing I can think of simpler, and I say &quot;ok, hello world. You are going to print hello world to the command line and you are going to like it motherfucker!&quot;

Fail at printing hello world. After another 5 hours of scrolling through message boards and looking at config files and reading error messages, it turns out an environment variable was set on my machine from a completely different program that was messing things up.

&quot;Ok, *now* hello world.... it works! Ok, so I just want to do X - that should be easy, right?&quot; 

After scrolling through documentation on the language/framework/whatever, I still haven&#039;t figured out how to do X. At which point, I say &quot;screw it&quot; and go drinking with friends instead.

On the other hand, the times when I&#039;ve been successful at learning software, it&#039;s because I sat down with a good book or tutorial that said &quot;this thing is here. This other thing is over here. Here&#039;s an example of how to do this common task. This is the rational behind structuring it this way.&quot; And then I do some exercises and learn the syntax and get everything set up correctly *and then* I can try to do something useful.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;I’m not sure I understand your reasoning. “I think I get paid a lot of money as compensation for never being allowed to question the underlying assumptions and structures of the system.” If that were it, couldn’t they find someone to more cheaply not question things? (I would think not questioning is a pretty easy skill to acquire!) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

I think the idea here is &quot;I&#039;m being paid a certain and high amount for my skills and my time. I&#039;m being paid even more on top of that to not use those same skills to raise questions about what my management does.&quot;

A company might pay N to a baseline employee, 1.2*N to a skilled version of baseline, 1.1*N to an unquestioning baseline, and 1.1*1.2*N to a skilled unquestioning baseline.]]></description>

Concubinage is a formally recognized relationship in a narrow set of societies and circumstances where such relationships are formally recognized.  It never really caught on for the type of relationships that are not officially recognized, should ideally be tactfully ignored but since we sometimes have to talk about them we have &quot;mistress&quot;.]]></description>
