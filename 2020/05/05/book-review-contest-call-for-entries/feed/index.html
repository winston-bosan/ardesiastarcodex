If you have actually written it, I can attest that the process for releasing it as a Kindle book is really not onerous.

(ETA: At least, I know this is so if it is a &quot;normal&quot; book: a fiction or nonfiction story told primarily in words. If it&#039;s a graphic novel, or something filled with charts and figures, I have no experience.)]]></description>

That&#039;s the same book I found on Amazon a few days ago and decided to use as a supplement. We&#039;ll see how this goes. :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, thanks Scott! This sounds amazing. I&#039;m really looking forward to trying to drum up an entry of my own. After scrolling through others&#039; comments (so many great ideas that I can&#039;t wait to read reviews for!) it looks like I&#039;ll be working on one of the few fiction submissions for this. I just need to decide exactly which book to do... Possibilities include taking a classic sci-fi novel and looking at its relevance to modern day (Canticle for Leibowitz? I, Robot?), or perhaps I&#039;ll get around to that idea I had of looking at what Asimov&#039;s Foundation series has to say about Great Man theory of history. Or maybe a thorough and analytical take down of why one of my least favorite books of all time is awful. The possibilities are endless!]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Maybe I’ll try Robert Weissberg’s Bad Students, Not Bad Schools, probably the most depressing book I’ve ever read. But everyone who writes about education should read it with an open mind and ask, honestly and rigorously, “Okay, why is he wrong?”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That is a great book and I would also enjoy seeing a review/discussion of it here. It&#039;s one of those cases where I&#039;m not sure that the author is right about everything, but he&#039;s right about enough relative to the current paradigm that I find it amazing the book isn&#039;t read more.]]></description>
