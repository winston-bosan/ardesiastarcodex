		<div class="comment-body"><p>Seeing news stories about China&#8217;s impending crackdown on Hong Kong, I wonder if some politician could make the obvious proposal — invite the citizens of Hong Kong to come here. All of them, or at least as many as want to.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a radical proposal, given current attitudes on immigration, but there are two things that might make it a little more popular than one would at first think. The first is that it&#8217;s an elegant counter move to China. The U.S. can complain all it likes about what China is doing, but China can and will ignore our complaints. Offering refuge for the oppressed inhabitants is something we can do unilaterally. And it is something that not only frustrates China, it hurts them, since it means a lot of skilled and able people, and a lot of wealth, leaving their control. </p>
<p>At the same time, this proposal should largely answer the worries of people who see immigration as letting in lots of very poor people to undercut the wages of the American poor. Hong Kong is the one part of China with per capita incomes at western levels. It&#8217;s famously full of able, hard working, entrepreneurial types, the sort of people who start companies, create jobs, make the country they live in richer. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not optimistic enough to think that either Trump or Biden would do it. But it&#8217;s at least an interesting thought.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Is it even legally possible to have different immigration rules for Hong Kong and the rest of China at this point? But even if it is, I&#8217;m not sure that &#8220;pissing off China&#8221; is something a US government would like to do.

<p>And hard working entrepreneurial types from visibly different ethnicities have historically not been very popular.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Is it even legally possible to have different immigration rules for Hong Kong and the rest of China at this point? </p></blockquote>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>A lot of Hong Kongers have different passports- there&#8217;s the HKSAR passport for Chinese citizens with permanent residence in HK, as well the British National (Overseas) passport which they could register for in 1997, which a few hundred thousand people hold, and the somewhat rarer British Overseas Citizen passport.</p>
<p>Many countries already treat holders of HKSAR passports differently from holders of mainland Chinese passports- 170 countries allow them to enter without a visa, compared to only 74 for a mainland Chinese passport.</p>
<p>The BN(O) passport has been in the news recently- the British government has previously stated that the Sino-British Joint Declaration forbids it from allowing BN(O)s to move to the UK, but has apparently just received legal advice to the contrary&#8230;</p>

<p>(This doesn&#8217;t apply to all HKers though).</p>
<p>I think quite a lot of HKers moved to Canada and Australia around 1997 too. I would&#8217;ve thought this generally increases the chances of such a scheme.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Quarantine Hotels</p>
<p>Has anyone suggested, or implemented, the idea of having hotels that specialize in quarantining people who have the coronavirus but are not sick enough to require hospitalization? Most hotel rooms include bathrooms, and hotels routinely provide in room food service. Someone who already has the disease is not at risk of catching it, so the fact that the person in the next room over also has it isn&#8217;t a problem — indeed, guests could socialize with each other if they wanted. There is no need for any of the hotel staff to ever come within six feet of a guest, or anything close, until the guest is well and checking out. At most, it would be sufficient to clean the room and change sheets and towels once a week or so, with the guest somewhere else and the cleaning done by someone in protective garb, after the room had been adequately ventilated. Or by someone who had already had the disease an so was presumably immune.</p>
<p>Obviously you would need testing to determine that someone had the disease, and either testing or a sufficient period without symptoms to determine that he no longer had it. But the cost of providing such facilities for free would be small compared to the costs we are currently absorbing, and making it easy and even attractive for individuals to quarantine should substantially reduce the risk of transmission.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>What benefit does that provide over just having people quarantine at home?<br />
The assumption that if one person gets it, the rest of their household will before they become symptomatic is a fairly sound one.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;d appreciate people poking holes in the following idea.</p>
<p>Since 50%+ of Covid-19 deaths occur in nursing homes, some people have proposed only locking down nursing homes and reopening the rest of society. The issue with this idea is that if Covid is running rampant in society, it&#8217;ll get into the nursing homes through the caregivers and staff.</p>
<p>In order to fix this, suppose we levy a small additional tax in order to massively fund nursing homes. Nursing homes would be given enough money to hire caregivers willing to live on campus until the pandemic is over, pay a generous severance to staff who leave because they&#8217;re not willing to live on campus, set up extra-safe food/supplies deliveries, etc. Benefits: prevents over 50% of Covid deaths, way cheaper than keeping the economy shut down and spending trillions on economic stimulus.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think this is essentially a good plan, but since you requested hole-poking: </p>
<p>1) The biggest issue: it&#8217;s not clear the pandemic will totally end anytime soon, if ever. That doesn&#8217;t invalidate this plan, but would make it more of a commitment. </p>
<p>2) Do we have enough people willing and able to do this work and live that isolated lifestyle? I imagine if the salary and accommodations were good enough, we&#8217;d find them, but paying for it won&#8217;t be popular. I have to imagine many who currently do the job have children they aren&#8217;t willing to leave behind. In general, we seem to avoid dealing with the issue of paying adequately for elder care, and while this provides an impetus to do something different, I don&#8217;t know if the political will exists. (One can see that this problem has also become evident in several other countries, which have had nursing home scandals). </p>
<p>3) Do the patients want to put protection from COVID-19 over visits from relatives and others who may come in to do activities? I&#8217;m sure this varies by person, but some of these people could end up with a very poor quality of life in exchange for a little more quantity.</p>
<p>4) Most of the people big on lockdowns really aren&#8217;t mainly worried about nursing home deaths, even if they are a major portion of the deaths. Maybe the issue could have been framed differently at the beginning and the fear and expectations would not have become so great, but they have.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Re (1) and (2): yeah it would have to be pitched as &#8220;we&#8217;re doing this mildly expensive thing in lieu of the massively expensive and inconvenient alternative.&#8221;</p>
<p>Re (3): I agree, but in the current state of things they&#8217;re not getting visitors *and* they might die from Covid anyway. Among the options (a) do what we&#8217;re doing now, (b) enact this plan, (c) reopen nursing home entirely, I&#8217;m not sure how to tell which of (c) or (b) is better, but it seems that (b) is certainly better than (a).</p>
<p>Thanks for the hole-poking!</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m interested in hearing about this. Did Florida really funnel extra money into nursing homes to fund stay-on-campus caregivers, or some other sort of radical program? Also, my sense is that Florida is opening up more quickly than other states, but is by no means completely open.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yes, the governor sent money to support their isolation from the rest of the population and encouraged municipalities to do so as well. The governor also forbade nursing homes from re-admitting patients that had been diagnosed (which they wanted to do because of reimbursements), including threatening arrests. He also put restrictions on people traveling from hotspots, though these were hampered by freedom of movement. (The infection spread to Florida not through its ports but from New York, as many New Yorkers simply dodged the quarantines.)</p>
<p>The governor followed a regional approach. Some rural counties didn&#8217;t lock down at all. My county, one of the most urban, did have a real lockdown but there was never much restriction of movement aside from certain sensitive areas. There was a curfew but it was relatively lax. Aside from restaurants and some tourism establishments, most places stayed open but with reduced business and social distancing measures. This still led to less business and fewer workers though.</p>
<p>There was an economic hit. Businesses closing, unemployment, that kind of thing. But my understand is we&#8217;re doing much, much better than the rest of the country. Last I heard, our unemployment rate had more than doubled but was still less than half of that of the country generally. And we had 1/15th the deaths of New York and much less than the national average on a per capita basis. The governor has been bragging about how our rates are slightly lower than California&#8217;s despite the fact we have very close ties to Italy and New York and California doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, I live fairly close to a few prominent business districts. Of the roughly four hundred businesses in the one closest to me, maybe about two dozen have shuttered, all of them restaurants or personal services like hair cutting (mostly high end). Maybe there&#8217;s more that haven&#8217;t announced it but that&#8217;s how it stands right now.</p>
<p>One thing that annoys me: Florida was constantly accused of &#8220;doing nothing&#8221; or &#8220;not enough&#8221;. The reality is that Florida had a plan from the beginning and executed it. It just wasn&#8217;t the lockdown certain people wanted. The Governor actually started meeting with experts once it hit Europe because we do so much trade with them.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Not that I doubt the overall conclusion, but how much of the difference in unemployment statistics can be explained by the fact that Florida&#8217;s UI system is designed to make it as difficult as possible to claim benefits, while California&#8217;s is the opposite?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Those numbers are unemployment statistics, not unemployment insurance claims. So the ease of applying would be irrelevant. The numbers on state assistance look &#8220;worse&#8221; in the sense more people are on it but some of that is due to impact payments, where employed people still get some aid money.</p>

<p>Same mostly, at least as far as I know. I regularly play at nursing homes as a charity kind of thing (I do get paid, but not very much). They&#8217;ve not invited me or anyone back for the duration and as far as I know are still cordoned off. I believe there are still police officers barring people from going to them, but I haven&#8217;t seen that with my own eyes. (I saw they did it at the beginning, but no idea if they still are.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Perhaps I&#8217;m out of date then. Though I will say, I didn&#8217;t say there hadn&#8217;t been an unemployment spike, just that last I&#8217;d heard it wasn&#8217;t as bad as it was nationally. Or possibly in New York, since our politicians compare us to them a lot.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You asked for finding holes, but in fact it is a good idea; many places are moving roughly in that direction. Only &#8220;downside&#8221; is that it will take some time (at least many weeks) to implement, and if Covid is already running rampant in the country, you still need to have a lockdown during that. Or face a large death toll.</p>
<p>Something along those lines imho should be done even if Covid problem disappears quickly. But I am not optimistic that political resolve to do that will remain in place.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I presume if 50% of the deaths occur in nursing homes, that&#8217;s not because 50% of the high-risk population actually lives in nursing homes, but because the infection spreads more easily in nursing homes. If we choose a path were most of the population will eventually get infected, old people living outside nursing homes will also start getting it and dying from it; nursing home residents just get it earlier. So we would be preventing much less than 50% of the COVID deaths overall, compared to having no quarantines either in general or for nursing homes.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>At least with me, the words are different. For example: &#8220;I incentivize people giving me ice cream.&#8221; vs &#8220;I incent people to give me ice cream.&#8221; The object is different. For example, you can say &#8220;I incentivize giving me ice cream.&#8221; but not &#8220;I incent giving me ice cream.&#8221; Meanwhile, you can say &#8220;I incent people.&#8221; but not &#8220;I incentivize people.&#8221; (Well, you can say that but it changes the meaning.)</p>
<p>Another example: performance is incentivized means that we have encouraged performance. Performance is incented means we&#8217;ve somehow motivated the concept of performance itself.</p>
<p>No idea if that&#8217;s grammatically correct but that&#8217;s how I use them.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Can anyone recommend a good channel about history on youtube? The periods and regions I&#8217;m most interested in are, in this order: pre-columbian and early post-columbian Americas (&lt;1600), the ancient world <i>outside</i> of the Mediterranean Sea and China, and whatever was going on in Subsaharan Africa when it wasn&#8217;t being colonized by the Europeans. Ideally I&#8217;m looking for something similar to <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDSzwZqgtJEnUzacq3ddoOQ" rel="nofollow ugc">Ben G Thomas</a>, only in history instead of paleontology.</p>
<p>ETA: while I&#8217;m at this, also soliciting recommendations of reading or watching or listening material on evolution of urban wildlife.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>As someone with a fair bit of math + CS background but no epidemiology background, I have the following naive concept of how I&#8217;d expect pandemic spread modeling to be done, and I&#8217;m interested to know if this sounds right to more relevantly experienced folks.</p>
<p>At the highest level, you want to execute a bunch of simulation runs on a population with a bunch of randomly distributed attributes that affect spread, and see what results and dynamics you get out of those runs on average. At each timestep of each run you generate random spread and disease evolution events that cause members of your simulated population to move among the states SIR or SEIRD or whatever.</p>
<p>In more detail, for each person p in your population P, you&#8217;d have static attributes SA_p that are set up at the start of each simulation run and don&#8217;t change over the course of the run, representing things like:<br />
&#8212; the type of social role they play: child, retired person, adult working at home, adult working outside the home, health care worker, etc<br />
&#8212; their base level of vulnerability to infection, to spreading given infection, and/or to morbidity/mortality given infection</p>
<p>And you&#8217;d have a graph SG with labeled edges, or a series of unlabeled graphs, representing different durable forms of social connection between people, e.g.<br />
&#8212; these two people are in the same household<br />
&#8212; these two people work together<br />
&#8212; these two kids go to the same school</p>
<p>And you have dynamic attributes DA_p(t) representing the state of person p at time t (infected or not, and for how long? symptomatic or not, and for how long? tested or not? quarantined or not? hospitalized or not?)</p>
<p>And you have some global state variables like &#8220;what day of the week is this timestep&#8221; and so on.</p>
<p>And your basic algorithm for running a simulation run looks like:</p>
<p>At time 0:<br />
1. Randomly generate SA_p for each member of the population based on known distribution data about types of people and best guesses about vulnerability levels of different classes of people.<br />
2. Randomly generate the graph(s) SG based on known data about household size distribution, business size distribution, fraction of people who work outside the home etc.<br />
3. Pick some random starting condition DA_p(0) where you e.g. randomly choose some smallish subset of people to be index patients.</p>
<p>Then at each timestep t (say one timestep = one day) till some end condition is reached:<br />
1. Generate a new connection graph DG(t) based on a simulation of what connections people would make that day given SA_p, SG, and DA_p(t-1). So people in the same household will have household interactions, health care workers will come into contact with hospitalized patients, people in the same workplace/school will have workplace/school interactions on weekdays, some people will randomly be next to each other on transit, some people will go shopping and randomly be next to each other in the store, some people especially on weekends will randomly choose to go to parties of randomly distributed size, some people will stay at home because they&#8217;re quarantined, etc. The edge weights in DG(t) would be based on best estimates of disease spread probability in those interaction situations.<br />
2. Execute one day&#8217;s worth of random disease spread, disease process evolution, and testing dynamics (and contact tracing dynamics too if you want to get fancy) based on DG(t), SA_p, and DA_p(t-1) to produce DA_p(t).</p>
<p>And then the interesting and actionable part is the part where you tweak the large number of implicit parameters to the steps above and see how that changes the average simulation run results. If you increase the fraction of people tested who successfully quarantine away from their household, what happens? If you change the rate of tests that are false positive/negative, what happens? If you close the schools, what happens? Etc.</p>
<p>Is this a reasonable approximation to how Real Professionals &#8482; actually do this? If it&#8217;s more complex/heterogeneous than any actually existing models, in what ways is that so, and why? Is it computational complexity constraints? Constraints on humans&#8217; ability to think through how to tweak so many parameters? Other ways in which increasing complexity would actually make it less representative of reality?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Thanks. If this is typical of models of this kind, then I guess my question narrows to: why use ODEs rather than discrete random-graph-based models, given that people are discrete entities [citation needed] and random graph parameterization ought to let you more intuitively encode assumptions about social interactions and disease spread probabilities?</p>

<p>@Nicholas Weininger<br />
As Knuth sayeth, &#8220;premature optimization is the root of all evil&#8221;. I doubt it takes more than 1kb per node, so you can get away with 1Gb/million. You can probably fit even US in the machine above. Or you can just buy one and fit it with 1Tb of RAM and play. </p>
<p>As for why&#8230; at a guess, having a 1node=1person model makes it pretty damn easy to change your model and test different parameters. Once you start optimizing you&#8217;re stuck with whatever assumptions you used to optimize.</p>

<p>If we were just copying how CFD simulations work, we&#8217;d be dividing the US into as many chunks as the computer could handle and still give us answers in a reasonable time. The reason we stop short of simulating every molecule of air is entirely &#8220;computational complexity constraints&#8221;.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;Would you treat the entire air mass as one undifferentiated thing with a single equation describing its behaviour?&#8221;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, chemists do this routinely: PV = nRT (the Ideal Gas Law) works quite well and breaks down chiefly when gases are either very dense or very cold. It works because individual gas molecules move so fast that it&#8217;s roughly correct to assume they don&#8217;t interact at all &#8212; the type of gas doesn&#8217;t matter at all either, provided there aren&#8217;t actual reactions that can occur.</p>
<p>There are improvements to the equation if you really want to be accurate, but PV = nRT is a very reasonable approximation with very realistic assumptions.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Is this a reasonable approximation to how Real Professionals ™ actually do this? </p></blockquote>
<p>Alas, no. What you describe is much closer to The Sims* than to what professionals call a mathematical model.</p>
<p>Simulations are rarely used as serious mathematical models (i.e. mathematical models that are meant to aid real world decision-making): combining stateful objects and behaviors with computationally expensive dynamics and tunable parameters almost never yields anything that corresponds well to reality.***</p>
<p>At its core, a proper mathematical model consists of a few input numbers, output numbers, and a governing dynamic. The input numbers (called independent variables in modeling lingo) better be quantities that we can measure experimentally in reality, and we can affect some of them in predictable, measurable ways (i.e. we control some of these numbers). The output numbers are the quantities that we wish to predict or optimize, but again they better be things that we can measure statistically or experimentally in reality. Equations relate the output numbers (called dependent variables) and the time variable to the input numbers. These equations constitute the dynamics of the system, and are themselves usually given as large arrays of numbers (the numbers denote certain terms in the equations). By solving the equations for the dependent variables, we are able to make predictions.**</p>
<p>So a mathematical model is a list of numbers describing reality, and a list of other numbers describing how the numbers in that first list evolve with time. So the numbers in that second list better be well-researched: for example, in an ideal world, the number that governs the relationship between the percentage of the population who have face masks (an independent variable that we have some control over) and the reproduction number of a virus would be based on a peer-reviewed publication which experimentally determined similar relationships for a variety of viruses in a variety of epidemics.</p>
<p>Is distributing face masks an effective policy? To answer this question, we would &#8220;run&#8221; the model (solve the equations, determine the dependent variables), then adjust the percentage of people with face masks, and run the model again. Then we could compare the dependent variables, and see if e.g. more masks would result in fewer dead people after 5 months, and understand what other effects more face masks would have on the other dependent variables.</p>
<p>We can look at reality and see what happens: for example, we might see that predator-prey populations show cyclical behavior, and find a <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations" rel="nofollow ugc">simple model</a> that has similar qualitative and quantitative behavior. In fact, we can use experiments to check that the numbers coming out of our model track quantities that appear in reality.</p>
<p>Good simulations are much harder to create: try to make a computer game in which animals display random realistic-seeming animal behaviors. and where the predator and prey quantities are cyclical as in reality. It&#8217;s really really difficult! More importantly, there is no experiment that you can conduct on actual foxes and rabbits that would tell you how to adjust the AI of your animals to get them to behave the way foxes and rabbits do. And if next week you need to model wolves and sheep instead, you&#8217;ll need to change everything, as these animals behave differently. Compare with the mathematical model: it needs but a few easily measurable numbers, generalizes across many many species and situations, and even allows for sensitivity analysis (which allows you to test that small measurement errors in your independent variables do not have a large effect on the results).</p>
<p>To get a good feel for how mathematical models work in practice, read up on Lotka-Volterra (linked above), the SIR model, and the <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2409858?seq=1" rel="nofollow ugc">kin selection model</a>, and imagine them on much larger scale (with many more terms).</p>
<p>Disclosure: I was part of two &#8220;meritorious winner&#8221; MCM teams way back during my undergrad, and I have a PhD in mathematics, but I do not work in mathematical modeling.</p>
<p>* Speaking of video games: Hearts of Iron 2 (Arsenal of Democracy, The Darkest Hour, etc.) had a combat model that is very close to what mathematical models look like: gigantic csv files filled with coefficients describing how variables (percentage of hard armor, total manpower of light infantry divisions, etc.) affect each other as the battle evolves.</p>
<p>** Since these are often, but not always, differential equations, this is the part where ODE solvers come in.</p>
<p>*** See Imperial&#8217;s disastrous &#8220;microsimulation&#8221;, still much much closer to a cellular SIR model than to what you envision.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I have a deep-thinking friend who thinks there is a significant likelihood that the 2020 US Presidential will not occur as scheduled.  More specifically, he thinks there will be enough state and local irregularities due to the COVID-19 crisis that the election results will be sufficiently disputed to cast the nation into chaos.   What are the chances that he&#8217;s right?  If the scenario he worries about was to take place, what&#8217;s the most likely pathway?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Like 2000, sure, or even more so, but not really 2016, I think &#8211; after 2016, the left was furious and appalled when Trump won, but there was no serious attempt to challenge or question the outcome the way there was in 2000.</p>
<p>The next most contested election in my memory of US politics (2000 and onwards, basically) was 2004, when a small number of Democrats suspected foul play in Ohio; 1992 might be worth referring to as well, but at the time I was barely aware of even UK politics.  </p>
<p>But running an election under Covid conditions where the loser doesn&#8217;t claim they&#8217;ve been cheated, possibly in the courts, strikes me as a tall order.</p>

<p>There was the rather ludicrous attempt at holding recounts in three states; I guess you&#8217;re not counting that as &#8220;serious&#8221;.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The election is about six months away. We’re consistently seeing reductions in new cases/deaths and even if there was a new wave in the fall, we’ll be much better prepared to handle it without the lockdown hammer. There will also be more systems in place to handle electronic voting. Let’s chill out on the “end of democracy” talk.</p>

<p>Those are two different predictions; has your friend thought deeply enough to reconcile them into a coherent whole?</p>
<p>There will almost certainly be a vote held on 3 November 2020 in every state of the Union.  There&#8217;s no basis for the legal or popular legitimacy of any specific alternative, so any State governor or legislature who tries to block that process will essentially be nullifying his state&#8217;s vote in the Electoral College and ceding the field to states which do hold the vote as scheduled.  If forty states elect slates of electors on 3 Nov 20 and ten do not, the forty states&#8217; worth of electors will decide the next President of the United States.</p>
<p>Lots of people will whine that this is unfair, because some of them were afraid to go to the polls that they think should have been cancelled, some of them tried to get absentee ballots but were confounded by the red tape, some of them voted just fine but are afraid that other people in their tribe were blocked from voting, etc.  None of them will do anything about it because nobody who matters is going to sign up for the uncertainty of standing behind an Antipresident.  That&#8217;s <i>way</i> more scary than going to the polls in the middle of a milquetoast plague like this, so anyone with the hypothetical balls to fight for an Antipresident is going to be standing in the ranks of the people who just elected the actual President.  </p>
<p>Also, judges and anyone else with a position of power or authority in the Federal government, has far more to lose by delegitimizing the Federal government from the top than they do from suffering four years of the &#8220;wrong&#8221; president.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a long shot possibility that Donald Trump decides to postpone the elections indefinitely so that he can continue ruling &#8220;until we get this under control&#8221;.  I&#8217;m pretty confident that most of his support within the government would evaporate if he did that, and would not be replaced by MAGA-hatted AR-15 bearers.  But I&#8217;m even more confident that Trump isn&#8217;t going to do anything that involves preemptively admitting he would lose an election and/or that he was wrong about claiming that the country can be safely reopened for at least the important things.</p>
<p>So, like Albatross11 says, 2000 and 2016 all over again.</p>

<p>The Constitution requires a majority of the total electoral votes, not a majority of the electoral votes of the states that passed some burden like &#8220;voted successfully.&#8221; </p>
<p>If those 40 states can give 270 electoral votes to one person, problem solved. If not, lots of gnashing of teeth and things possibly fall to the House.</p>

<p>Only electors who are <i>appointed</i>, count.  If a state somehow doesn&#8217;t bother to appoint electors, tough for them but history is made by those who participate.</p>

<p>Note that there is even precedent: in 1864 (after the Civil War) the eleven states of the former Confederacy did not cast electoral votes. Even in 1868, Mississippi, Virginia, and Texas did not.

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>thats the wording the founders used for ‘majority’??</p></blockquote>
<p>What alternative wording would you chose to specify exactly which majority you are talking about?</p>
<p>Consider the following case: At current levels of congressional representation, the 50 states are allowed and expected to appoint 538 electors.  Because of coronoavirus snafus, only 412 electors are appointed by 40 states.  Of these, only 397 actually cast ballots on 14 December 2020; the rest are hiding under their beds in fear.  Of the 397, 342 cast ballots for one of the two major-party candidates, 49 cast ballots for minor-party candidates, and five cast blank ballots in protest.</p>
<p>How many electoral-college ballots does a candidate&#8217;s name have to appear on for them to be declared the winner, and what is the wording that makes this the clear and unambiguous answer?</p>

<p>it&#8217;s redundant.  there is a weaker condition, and then a stronger condition that includes the weaker condition.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>A person having assets over $500,000 shall be a millionaire, if such assets are also over $1,000,000.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re assuming there are only two candidates receiving electoral votes.  That&#8217;s been true <i>most</i> of the time, but not always: it&#8217;s happened as recently as 2016 thanks to faithless electors, though the last time a third-party candidate outright <i>won</i> a state was 1968, when George Wallace took most of the Deep South.  And it&#8217;s a situation that the writers of the Constitution thought would be a lot more common than it turned out to be.</p>
<p>With three or more strong candidates in the mix, it&#8217;s quite easy &#8212; likely, even &#8212; for the person with the most electoral votes not to carry a majority.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s redundant the other way around: a majority is necessarily also the most electoral votes for any candidate.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&gt; has your friend thought deeply enough to reconcile them into a coherent whole</p>
<p>Presumably.  He&#8217;s an aspiring pundit and pitching this is the thesis of an article he&#8217;s pitching to some major media outlets.   I fear the answer might be that the &#8220;no election&#8221; summary is designed as the rhetorical headline attention grabber, and the &#8220;local issues&#8221; is down in the details of the article that are more solidly reasoned.   Or more likely is just that I phrased the question in a way that doesn&#8217;t reflect his thinking.</p>
<p>&gt; There’s a long shot possibility that Donald Trump decides to postpone the elections </p>
<p>I think this is the direction he thinks is most likely, although again, that might be because he&#8217;s aiming the piece at the left-aligned media.  I tend to think this a low probability, for the &#8220;Trump doesn&#8217;t want to appear weak&#8221; reasons you give.  He&#8217;s also assuming a sufficiently harmful second wave of COVID-19 will be happening around election time, which might change the logic here.  If Trump or Biden themselves are stricken, would people judge the probabilities differently?</p>
<p>My initial reaction is that &#8220;of course&#8221; the election will happen as scheduled, and that the loser will ineffectually complain that this was unfair.  But as I thought about it more, I wasn&#8217;t sure.  If there is a continuing raging epidemic, maybe there will be a large state or two that moves to &#8220;no in-person voting&#8221;, followed by a successful legal challenge regarding this?  Or maybe there&#8217;s a sufficient faction of states to bring the totals below 270 who think they can pre-negotiate something with the House?  Maybe, thus my open-ended question here.  Thanks for offering your thoughts.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>On top of all that, let&#8217;s say Trump does somehow manage to postpone the election indefinitely. According to the Constitution, his term still ends on January 20th, 2021, as does the term of his Vice President. If a new President and Vice President haven&#8217;t been elected at that time, then the position will simply go to the next person in the Presidential line of succession by default. Since the next person in line would be the Speaker of the House, we&#8217;d likely end up with Nancy Pelosi as President, unless the Republicans retake the House (or the Democrats suddenly decide to replace her for some reason, or she dies or steps down or otherwise vacates the office, but those are less likely). Even if it the Democrats lose the House and we do end up with another Republican President, it&#8217;s not going to end up being a Trump-style Republican who appeals to the nationalists and right-populists and Tea Partiers, it&#8217;s going to be an establishment suit like Kevin McCarthy or Steve Scalise. Would Trump or his die-hard fanbase be satisfied by that outcome? Probably not, I&#8217;d imagine.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If no elections were held, then Pelosi wouldn&#8217;t be in the House either since her term also ends in 2020 and she would equally vacate her office automatically. So it would actually fall to Senator Grassley (R), third in line, whose term ends in 2022. Otherwise I believe it&#8217;s a fair interpretation, at least de jure.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;No elections&#8221; being held is rather unlikely, given that several states are well-experienced with universal Vote By Mail.  Worst non-ludicrous case, we get Representatives and Presidential electors chosen from Oregon, Washington, Colorado, and Hawaii.  Having a Democratic majority, they would most likely then proceed to impeach President Trump for unconstitutionally trying to postpone the election &#8211; and I would be cheering them on.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m not sure if that is entirely correct. If the House all vacate their seats due to their terms being up, then so do the Class 2 Senators. 21 of those are Republicans to 12 Democrats, so the remaining Senate would have a Democratic majority, and the president <i>pro tempore</i> would probably be Patrick Leahy.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Agree with others that the election will happen, but it will be a huge mess. </p>
<p>The PM of Singapore is debating postponing next year&#8217;s elections, but says he thinks it is important for the government to have a mandate from the people as to how to approach the pandemic. I agree with this sentiment. Unfortunately, I feel like this election will provide us with anything but a mandate. Both sides will probably try to avoid taking a strong position or laying out a specific plan, and will instead obscure the issues so that they can effectively weaponize them against the other side. It will probably be a close vote, and whoever loses will feel the election was stolen, and that they were the victim of unfair circumstances related to the pandemic. But I guess a lot can change between now and then.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>An Oxford University vaccine trial has only a 50 per cent chance of success because coronavirus is fading so rapidly in Britain, a project co-leader has warned.</p>
<p>…Hill said that of 10,000 people recruited to test the vaccine in the coming weeks — some of whom will be given a placebo — he expected fewer than 50 people to catch the virus. If fewer than 20 test positive, then the results might be useless, he warned.</p></blockquote>
<p>From the <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/low-virus-rate-leaves-oxford-vaccine-trial-with-only-50-percent-chance-20200524-p54vvu.html" rel="nofollow ugc">Sydney Morning Herald</a> via <a rel="nofollow"href="https://marginalrevolution.com/" rel="nofollow ugc">Marginal Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>If we had recognized this is a true emergency that not only permitted but actively demanded that we let volunteer vaccine testers risk their health for the world&#8217;s benefit, we would probably already know if the Moderna vaccine (delivered to NIH in late February) was safe (in the short term, at least) and effective.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>A common trope in Sci-Fi, is meeting an alien civilization and either start to cooperate or start a war with them.  In reality, civilisations develop so quickly, that meeting another civilisation equal to us or just slightly more or less advanced, would be an incredible coincident. They are much more likely to be at least thousands of year behind or ahead of us. Both cooperation and warfare then seem hopelessly lopsided. The more advanced species can benevolently teach the lesser one some useful things, but not too much I would think. They don&#8217;t want the more primitive civilisation to catch up and surpass their own level, which they could do if they were innately more intelligent (how much faster would the industrial revolution have happened, if the average human IQ was 15 points higher?)</p>
<p>Would we even want to meet an alien race?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>One alternative is that the interstellar society is extremely static and conservative, like the aliens in Turtledove&#8217;s _Worldwar_ series.  That is, there was a lot of innovation and conflict until the lizards conquered their home planet, then all that noisy disruptive change got shut down and now innovation is very slow and looked-upon with great skepticism.  You can iteratively improve things like ergonomics, but nothing fundamental.  The lizards have interstellar travel and coldsleep and fusion power, but also tanks and fighter jets at a 1980s technology level&#8211;basically the tech level they had when they conquered their own world and consolidated it under their emperor.  </p>
<p>You could imagine a society so locked down that any new technological progress gets stamped out as a threat to the existing order.  A few centuries of that, and the whole social mileu people grow up in will regard innovation as pathological and nasty.  </p>
<p>But, there&#8217;s no reason we&#8217;d expect such a society to freeze conveniently close to our technology level.  In _Worldwar_, 1980s-era military technology meets 1940s technology, which is nice for storytelling (close enough for a fight, and we can have a lot of confidence about 1980s-era military technology) but it seems more likely it would be 2050-era military technology or 2300-era military technology, against which the 1940s-era stuff would stand no chance.  And even so, there&#8217;s internal dialogue that indicates their initial probes saw humans around 1000 AD, against which any modern technology is going to be unbeatable.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>The lizards have interstellar travel and coldsleep and fusion power, </p></blockquote>
<p>And IIRC developing coldsleep is easier because they are, well, lizards. </p>
<p>I think this is a potential counterpoint to the idea that any starfaring species will be unimaginably advanced- some species may simply be able to develop space/interstellar flight earlier. This could be because of their biology, or because of the nature of their homeworld. Imagine a species on a planet with a mountain similar to Olympus Mons, such that it&#8217;s possible to build a road (or possibly even a railway!) up to a spaceport that&#8217;s above most of your atmosphere.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>After a dozen recursive reworkings? Think not. Once you start reworking your own substance, that process will keep going until you hit fundamental limits and total self-satisfaction. That is, to eschew that tool kit, you must have exhausted it, and have the pride of the dawnstar before his Fall. </p>
<p>&#8211; That is, someone stepping off a starship will not just be an alien engineered to the upper bounds of what an extremely implausibly lucky freak of nature specimen of their ancestral origin species might be like &#8211; that was version 2.0, 200.000 years ago. 3.0 was what got built after the impact of every member of their species having 200 alien ip shook out, and the being stepping of the space ship is v 23.19a2, and most accurately described as a pile of picotech.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>This assumes tech is infinitely developable, tho.</p>
<p>If interplanetary travel is possible, it may be around the top of the &#8220;tech tree&#8221;. Propulsion, shielding for radiation, some kind of hibernation for the life forms are the main problems each civilization would have to solve before interplanetary contact is possible. Either the contactee has those or not. If the contactee has those, well, it will be one sided. If both have them, I don&#8217;t see any guarantee one of the civilizations will have versions of those techonologies way<br />
more advanced than the other. Maybe it will have a group of tech that&#8217;s more advanced but the other side would have preferred to develop a different side.</p>
<p>Which brings us to differences in local resources that could be critical too. Imagine a spacefaring civilization for which plastic was super expensive. They would have had to make do with just metals and ceramics and rubber. If it contacts a civ which has cheap plastic, each will receive a ton of information on, either how to use a resource they don&#8217;t have, or how to make do without that resource. Each could benefit, even the one without plastic, cause it could go looking for it.</p>
<p>If a bunch of said civilizations keep meeting, their science/tech standard would soon cover a lot of possibilities, and in that case, new civilizations arriving would only be in the receiving side of the tech exchange, but that doesn&#8217;t really hold for a bunch of first encounters.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>One other thing: our biology determines how advanced we must be to do interstellar travel.  Imagine an intelligent species with 10,000 year lifespans, or who can go into some kind of deep hybernation during which they don&#8217;t age and consume minimal resources.  They can do interstellar travel with much less technology than we can, because they don&#8217;t need to worry about generation ships or inventing coldsleep or something.  They just need to figure out how to get to another star in a couple thousand years with an intact ship.  That&#8217;s still hard, but it&#8217;s not nearly as hard as getting humans to another star within a generation or two.  </p>
<p>Alternatively, you might have intelligent species that evolve in very low-atmosphere, high-radiation environments, who find being in space sort-of like we find being at the south pole&#8211;uncomfortable, but you don&#8217;t need insanely high technology to survive there.  So getting into space is not so hard, and maybe you can colonize your solar system without a lot more hardship and danger than, say, the Polynesians colonized islands in the Pacific.  If humans were as robust as, say, bacterial spores, we could launch them into space with some kind of giant gun and no space suit and they&#8217;d be fine.  </p>
<p>On the other side, maybe your lifespan is 100 days so interstellar (or even interplanetary) travel provides much harder tech challenges.  Or maybe your species is naturally very fragile w.r.t. acceleration, so it&#8217;s super-hard to even get manned ships into orbit.  </p>
<p>Whatever explains the lack of visible aliens and alien structures has to apply to all these kinds of species, unless there&#8217;s some reason why super-long-lived, deep-hybernating, or extremely robust creatures can&#8217;t develop intelligence.</p>
<p>But that also means that it&#8217;s hard to know just how high-tech you need to be to get to the stars.  Humans need a lot of technology that maybe the 10,000-year species and the tough-as-spores species don&#8217;t need.  And super-fragile short-lived species probably need even more than we do.  So if we imagine some society that freezes its technology just after getting interstellar travel, it might not be all that advanced compared to humans who encounter it in 2100, say.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yeah, I ignored even those possibilities. It&#8217;d lead to different technologies too, yeah. Tho I dunno if the long lived aliens would find an use to hibernation technologies. I guess even them would want to sleep for a long time and wake up in the future.</p>
<p>Another point may be just plain old the mass on the original planet. It cannot be too light, or the atmosphere may escape, but probably a planet with less g than Earth but more than Mars, would be more amenable to spaceflight. Their rocketry may not be that advanced.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>The more advanced species can benevolently teach the lesser one some useful things, but not too much I would think. They don’t want the more primitive civilisation to catch up and surpass their own level, which they could do if they were innately more intelligent (how much faster would the industrial revolution have happened, if the average human IQ was 15 points higher?)</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of that is happening in Cherryh&#8217;s <i>Foreigner</i> series, which I have mentioned before. Humans from a colonizing starship that has gotten lost arrive at a planet occupied by Atevi, humanoids with a steam engine technology. A lot of humans end up parachuting down — the spaceship doesn&#8217;t have landing craft, and the people in charge of it are opposed to humans going down. The spaceship goes off, the humans interact with the Atevi. Initially relations go well, something goes wrong, there is a war which the humans, technologically superior but vastly outnumbered, lose. The Atevi agree to evacuate a New Zealand sized Island for the humans to live on, with the humans feeding the Atevi technology slowly enough not to disrupt their society.</p>
<p>Two centuries later, when the story really begins, the Atevi are approaching technological equality with the humans. Atevi are much better natural mathematicians than humans, possibly somewhat higher IQ in general, so once they learn about computers they make better designs than the humans. The series is now something like eighteen books long, there is complete technological equality, including some tech from the starship which has finally returned — and persuaded the Atevi to build shuttles and get the orbiting station back functioning, in cooperation with the human population on the planet. </p>
<p>Interesting books, and the issue of societal disruption through technological change is one of the multiple themes, along with the issue of interactions between two intelligent species with somewhat different emotional hard wiring. Also very interesting characters. Cherryh is one of my favorite sf writers.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The scenario where I could see some meaningful exchange is in the case that physical interstellar travel is hard/impossible. Military conflict is a non-starter. Letting slip some tech wouldn&#8217;t be the end of the world, because the aliens would be assured that humanity is not likely to develop effective interstellar capabilities when they haven&#8217;t with an extra 1000 years or whatever of trying. They aren&#8217;t going to learn any new physics or engineering principles from us, but they would probably want to learn more about our planet/biology/culture.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think that it is quite likely that there is a ceiling to technological advancement. The space of possible techs includes very smart AI&#8217;s, and rearranging a solar system into computronium could plausibly be done in a few years with good self replicating nanotech. I think that there probably aren&#8217;t any technologies that are physically possible, but so hard that they can&#8217;t be invented in 1000 years by a super-intelligence that has converted the solar system into computronium.  (This is a weak bound on a highly uncertain quantity. Maybe technological development is really easy to a superintelligence, and it invents every possible tech almost the moment its turned on.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Cooperation or warfare could be viable if there were multiple alien actors, similar to the way client states in the Cold War could play the superpowers off each other for their own benefits. See Vietnam or Afghanistan for successful examples of warfare one power bloc provided military weapons to an underdeveloped country to prevent a rival&#8217;s conquest. Alternatively, numerous countries received significant economic and scientific aid from the superpowers to prevent them from falling into the enemy camp.</p>
<p>This could even happen, although it would be more limited, within a single alien race. For example, the Indian Independence movement exploited internal divisions within Britain, as have numerous modern actors under the US sole-superpower.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I somehow own a book called “The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Cartoon Animals,” published in 1991. This is an amazing artifact, because the author tries to include ALL cartoon animals up to the date of publication—in movies, cartoons, TV commercials, comic strips, and comic books (mainstream and underground), both U.S. and foreign. (Sample entry: “Hong Kong Fooey: kung fu cartoon dog,” followed by an 800-word exegesis.) There are 2,000 entries.</p>
<p>It’s a monument to the human spirit. Who would even try to keep track of cartoon animals, and who would be foolish enough to publish an (instantly outdated) softcover book? (Prentice Hall, FYI.) It’s like counting grains of sands on a cartoon beach.</p>
<p>Anyone, one fascinating thing about &#8220;The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Cartoon Animals&#8221; is that it captures the moment when Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were at their peak, with the result that other publishers issued these knockoffs, all of which have their own entries:</p>
<p>Mildly Microwaved Prepubescent Kung-Fu Gophers<br />
Adolescent Radioactive Black-Belt Hamsters<br />
Cold-Blooded Chameleon Commandos<br />
Geriatric Gangrene Jujitsu Gerbils<br />
Naïve Inter-Dimensional Commando Koalas<br />
Pre-Teen Dirty-Gene Kung-Fu Kangaroos</p>
<p>Can you tell I have too much time on my hands lately?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Quora is hit and miss, by subject area. It was much better years ago. I still have the occasional good experience there w/ technical subjects or dry history questions distant from the culture wars; I have *not* had a good experience with much else. Might be worth a try, if &#8220;dumb political philosophy question&#8221; is very far toward &#8220;what did Bismark think about unification of Germany circa 1850&#8221; on the spectrum between questions like that and questions like &#8220;how should I feel about Donald Trump&#8217;s governing philosophy&#8221;&#8230; then you might get some help out of Quora. </p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Over on the Online Go Server, I am running into some low-ranked players who open the game by playing the center point (as black). The books I have about the game consistently advocate opening in the corners and then expanding toward the middle. The goal of the game is to surround territory. You need fewer stones to surround an area if it is in the corner. Hence corner points are more valuable and should be grabbed first. That makes sense to me.</p>
<p>Is opening on the center point just a clueless play, or is there some logic to it I am missing?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Both! </p>
<p>There is an opening called <a rel="nofollow"href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?GreatWall" rel="nofollow ugc">the great wall</a> that involves move 1 at the central star point in some variations, but it&#8217;s kind of more theoretical than real. The general idea is to weird people out and to make a big, powerful shape at center you can fight from, as opposed to build territory from. </p>
<p>It seems to be a little trollish, in that a big part of using it seems to be relying on your opponent to not know how to respond to it. </p>
<p>Looking at playing the central star point initially as black as a pattern at <a rel="nofollow"href="http://ps.waltheri.net/" rel="nofollow ugc">Waltheri</a> (play &#8220;6&#8221; as the initial move&#8221;) shows very few pro games in which it&#8217;s used, but it seems rare and especially rare lately &#8211; the most recent game I see is from 2018. It wins in their records a surprising amount of the time, at 47%. Go look at those games to get an idea of optimal response, but be careful treating winning responses from white as &#8220;good&#8221;, since the sample size is small.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s three games in which it was used at Go Siegan! He lost one of them, then the same guy tried it again and got beat real hard. It&#8217;s kind of the same plot as &#8220;The Great White Hype&#8221;! </p>
<p>From a super amateur perspective:</p>
<p>In the first several moves, playing in the center is giving up corners; this is inherently sub-optimal in terms of territory-building efficiency, so if the game didn&#8217;t end up having a bunch of fights that black then won, white is going to win. In real low level play, it seems to me that white wants to avoid mixing it up with black&#8217;s weirdness, take whatever extra corners black will give, and then build territory without provoking a bunch of fights. From black&#8217;s perspective, he&#8217;s praying that white fights with his big thick wall and provokes those fights if he doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>There are apparently semi-legitimate pro reasons to open there, most of which boil down to &#8220;make shit weird for white and hope he can&#8217;t cope&#8221;. From an amateur perspective, you can assume black doesn&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s doing or is cheating from Waltheri&#8217;s. Just play normal conservative corner-building stuff and you should win most of the time.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If you&#8217;re talking about players who are so low-ranked that they play on the 9&#215;9 board: There, the center point makes a lot more sense.<br />
About mirroring, this probably doesn&#8217;t make sense because of komi. Apart from making the game boring.</p>
<p>Other than that, I (also rather low-ranked) agree that this is basically throwing the move away, because except for some ladders possibly working your way, it doesn&#8217;t do very much.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>One of the things that surprised me about the UK was their comparatively well-preserved historical heritage, and that they manage to do it without huge government subsidies.</p>
<p>The standard narrative I&#8217;ve been told by British people is that it&#8217;s thanks to the National Trust, and some front-loading of money by the government into it, after which the National Trust works by their more commercial side, while maintaining the more important buildings and managing tourists. </p>
<p>I thought at the time it&#8217;d be nice to have a National Trust equivalent in Spain, but now I&#8217;m starting to think that what makes conservation possible in the UK is less restrictive laws. In the UK, historical sites, churches and other buildings get converted into homes, and people buy them and live in them. The Spanish National Trust would not be able to restore and then sell a church as a home, making money on it.</p>
<p>In Spain, the whole issue with the churches is a nightmare. Even if we ignore those that are owned by the Catholic Church (and that would be the majority), I don&#8217;t think you could buy a private or community-owned church as a home. So, obviously, there is no interest from anybody to buy those churches to restore them.</p>
<p>Anecdote: a church was having a restoration, and they were overhauling their altarpiece. They had an art piece, that according to the Church, had no historical, artistic, or sacred value* that would warrant its restoration, so they were going to throw it away. So a contractor saw the painting in the garbage, and asked if he could take it and restore it on his own. Some time later, this guy gets arrested for trying to sell the painting. The Church says they gave the painting to this guy, and they say that. But it turns out, you can&#8217;t sell religious art to anybody but another religious order or the government. Was the government interested in restoring this worthless painting? No, or the Church would have given it to them. The Spanish government already has a lot more sacred and historical objects than they can restore and maintain.</p>
<p>France also keeps trying to sell some of its castles for 1 euro. But they are in so much need of restoration, and the conditions are so strict, that nobody bothers. Meanwhile, the UK&#8217;s castles and palaces are used to film movies, celebrate weddings, banquets, company dinners, and all kinds of things, since you&#8217;re allowed to put modern plumbing.</p>
<p>*Spain is full of those. The infamous Spanish Ecce Homo was fresco one such piece, made by an artist who manufactured identical paintings in huge quantities.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If you&#8217;re praising the UK for its lack of restrictive historic housing regulation, then I don&#8217;t want to know how bad Spain is.  </p>
<p>I know people who have owned Listed buildings and it&#8217;s an absolute faff to try to get the Council to sign off on any renovations or alterations. But I suspect this is the sort of thing where there&#8217;s a minority of power-tripping planning inspectors that generate most of the horror stories.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Well, at least when it comes to churches, it is a lot less restrictive. </p>
<p>Although most churches are owned by the Catholic Church in Spain, there are quite a few community-owned churches (cofradias) in Spain.</p>
<p>My aunt inherited our family&#8217;s part of the cofradia in Spain. The community has been trying to donate the church to the City Hall for more than a decade, and the City Hall only accepted it in the end because it came with a bit of land and forests (which, back in the day, where enough for church maintenance).</p>
<p>In the UK, you could sell it to a person who would live in it. Somebody would pay actual money for that place they can&#8217;t get rid of for free! And it&#8217;s not that nobody would like to live in that place &#8211; there are new houses that are built in the area, and older houses and barns get restored and converted into homes. It&#8217;s just that you can&#8217;t live in that church.</p>
<p>So yes, it appears to me like the UK&#8217;s laws on listed buildings, at least the religious ones, are much less restrictive than Spain&#8217;s.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think people tend to live in deconsecrated churches (old rectories are another matter) so much as use them as commercial spaces. Like there&#8217;s one up Leeds way that&#8217;s a Costa coffee now and of course Adele&#8217;s recording studio.  </p>
<p>But I suspect that&#8217;s more a matter of very different religious history than a reflection of secular building conservation.  </p>
<p>*ok I&#8217;m actually too southern to know what &#8216;reasonably priced&#8217; looks like.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Buying a church building (of the Established church) to convert into a house in England (remember, the UK has 3 separate secular legal systems, and the Church of England also has its own laws) is still a very complicated process. Churches can only be deconsecrated by Act of Parliament or Measure of the General Synod, and this still doesn&#8217;t affect any protection the church may have as a Listed building.</p>
<p>Is there no legal way for a church building in Spain to stop being a church?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ve searched, but I haven&#8217;t found either the established procedure, or cases of it happening. But then, I couldn&#8217;t even figure out the word for it in Spanish, either.</p>
<p>Spain was very religious until very recently; about fifty years ago or so. And then, when people didn&#8217;t have to go to church, they stopped going there, and the process was like an avalanche.</p>
<p>Most people in my parent&#8217;s generation got church marriages; even my atheists parents got married in the church, for complicated paperwork reasons. Civil marriages have become a lot more common for my generation.</p>
<p>Everybody in my school was bapthised, and everybody went through confirmation. Now, they don&#8217;t seem to do it as much, either.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Getting permission for fixing something may be as easy/hard in the UK as in Spain. </p>
<p>The main point is, once you&#8217;ve invested the money, the uses you can get out of a restored building are more permissive in the UK than in Spain. And that is the difference that makes restoration profitable or not.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p><i>If you’re praising the UK for its lack of restrictive historic housing regulation, then I don’t want to know how bad Spain is.</i><br />
+1 to this. Things like this bring out my inner libertarian. Hyper-restrictive rules about historic buildings must I think be motivated by the belief that using a building (in some way different to its original use) degrades it; which actually tends to be true; but the missing term in the calculation is that <i>not</i> using a building degrades it faster (on average).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It seems to me like the UK also has its share of idiocy. I remember when I was in Edinburgh, it just seemed so dirty; when I asked why they don&#8217;t clean the buildings (some of them where quite fancy hotels; they could afford it), I was told that since the center of Edinburgh is UNESCO World Heritage, they can&#8217;t clean it.</p>
<p>I understand not cleaning in cases like the controversial Black Madonna in Chartres, but I do think that scrapping the soot from the Industrial revolution from historical buildings is good. It makes things better, and it helps conservation.</p>
<p>The UK still makes it work better than Spain or even France (so it&#8217;s not about money).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Cleaning the soot off seems to be a latitude thing.<br />
I can&#8217;t find any photos but the older generation informs me that the houses of Parliament used to be all brown and nasty, before restoration in the 80s. And Brimingham looks less sooty than you&#8217;d expect of the heart of the dark satanic mills.  </p>
<p>But stuff seems to be less likely to get cleaned once you reach Yorkshire.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m going to speculate that this is a geological thing, rather than the question of local political finances that might seem the most obvious explanation. Stone is heavy, so old buildings were predominantly built out of what could be quarried locally. In the south, that&#8217;s mostly limestone. In the north, mostly sandstone. Limestone is easier to clean without causing structural damage.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>From what I can tell, the big problem with cleaning Edinburgh is that the buildings are overwhelmingly sandstone. It&#8217;s porous, so the stains run deep, and soft and easily dissolved, all of which means that it&#8217;s very difficult to clean without doing structural damage that will lead to further degradation over time.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Quite a long time ago, we visited Penhow castle in Wales. The owner, who I think was a historian or archaeologist, had restored different parts of it to their conditions at different parts of the castle&#8217;s history. The original part was just a single tower, room above room — every time they changed the guard on the roof, the men went through the castellan&#8217;s bedroom. The most recent part was the Victorian section, where windows had been cut through several feet of stone wall. There was a recording you could listen to as you went through. </p>
<p>I remember elsewhere in Europe staying in &#8220;castle hotels&#8221; in a variety of countries. All of that would have been something like thirty years ago, so things may have gotten more restrictive since.</p>

The only exception I know of when 2 sects came together and united is the Uni-Uni&#8217;s (Unitarians and Universalists) in 1961. Are there any other examples?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s not that uncommon, really.  For example, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) formed as a union of three earlier organizations (ALC, LCA, and AELC) in 1988.  The United Church of Christ formed when the Evangelical and Reformed Church and the General Council of the Congregational Christian Churches united in 1957.  The United Methodist Church formed when the Methodist Church and the Evangelical United Brethren Church united in 1968.  The United Presbyterian Church of North America merged with the PCUSA in 1958 to form the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (UPCUSA).  These are just a few examples of such things, and these are just from the USA.</p>
<p>Depending on how much union you want, the ELCA, Episcopal Church (USA), Moravian Church, Presbyterian Church (USA), Reformed Church in America, United Church of Christ, and United Methodist Church are all in full communion with each other, and their clergy regularly fill in for each other.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.united-church.ca/community-faith/welcome-united-church-canada/history-united-church-canada" rel="nofollow ugc">United Church of Canada</a> was formed by the merger of three major protestant denominations in 1925 and has since absorbed a few other denominations and individual congregations.</p>
<blockquote><p>The United Church was inaugurated on June 10, 1925 in Toronto, Ontario, when the Methodist Church, Canada, the Congregational Union of Canada, and 70 per cent of the Presbyterian Church of Canada entered into a union. Also joining was the small General Council of Union Churches, centred largely in Western Canada. It was the first union of churches in the world to cross historical denominational lines and received international acclaim. Each of the founding churches had a long history in Canada prior to 1925. The movement for church union began with the desire to coordinate ministry in the vast Canadian northwest and for collaboration in overseas missions. Congregations in Indigenous communities from each of the original denominations were an important factor in the effort toward church union. </p>
<p>The United Church continues to be a &#8220;uniting&#8221; church, and has been enriched by several additional unions since 1925. In 1930, the Synod of The Wesleyan Methodist Church of Bermuda became part of The United Church of Canada’s Maritime Conference. The Evangelical United Brethren Church became part of The United Church of Canada in 1968. In addition, various individual congregations from other Christian communions have became part of the United Church over the years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Each of the three major churches that joined in 1925 was itself a product of <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.united-church.ca/sites/default/files/resources/ucc-family-tree.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">earlier unions</a>.</p>
<p>I expect there will be more of this, as liberal Christianity continues to <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2016/12/15/why-conservative-churches-grow-and-liberal-churches-shrink/" rel="nofollow ugc">collapse</a>.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>There are lots of smaller Protestant denominations which, when sufficiently fissioned off from parent bodies, were too small to independently survive so they merged with other small denominations.</p>
<p>Other, somewhat larger, bodies came together (ironically) as a result of splits, see one of the three Lutheran bodies in the USA:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America is the product of a series of mergers and represents the largest (3.6 million members) Lutheran church body in North America. The ELCA was created in 1988 by the uniting of the 2.85-million-member Lutheran Church in America, 2.25-million-member American Lutheran Church, and the 100,000-member Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches. The ALC and LCA had come into being in the early 1960s, as a result of mergers of eight smaller ethnically-based Lutheran bodies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or the Presbyterians in the USA, who also have divided into two major <i>blocs</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Presbyterian Church in the United States of America was joined by the majority of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, mostly congregations in the border and Southern states, in 1906. In 1920, it absorbed the Welsh Calvinist Methodist Church. The United Presbyterian Church of North America merged with the PCUSA in 1958 to form the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (UPCUSA).</p>
<p>&#8230;An attempt to reunite the United Presbyterian Church in the USA with the Presbyterian Church in the United States in the late 1950s failed when the latter church was unwilling to accept ecclesiastical centralization. &#8230;Attempts at union between the churches (UPCUSA and PCUS) were renewed in the 1970s, culminating in the merger of the two churches to form the Presbyterian Church (USA) on June 10, 1983. </p>
<p>&#8230;The merger essentially consolidated moderate-to-liberal American Presbyterians into one body.</p></blockquote>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>UU suggests another example. The Unitarians were the most liberal of the New England Puritans, splitting off around 1800. The Universalists were the most liberal of the German-American Calvinists, splitting off around 1800. The rest of the Puritans, known as Congregationalists from 1800, merged with much of the rest of the German Calvinists to form the United Church of Christ.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I often read stories about internal government documents remaining classified for a very long time. For a recent example,  files related to the JFK assassination were supposed to finally be declassified in 2017, although some of those files were subsequently held back until 2021. From what I can tell, the general standard is 25 years as per this <a rel="nofollow"href="https://fas.org/sgp/clinton/eo12958.html" rel="nofollow ugc">executive order</a>, where extensions can be made for one of nine reasons listed in section 3.4 of the link.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m having trouble imagining specific examples of secrets the government needs to hold for that long. What serves the national interest to be held secret for 25 years? To take it further, are there any things that serve the national interest to be held secret for 50 years? Or longer?</p>
<p>Do the above lists mainly consist of secrets that when revealed would cause reputational harm? In terms of national security, the first things that come to my mind don&#8217;t seem to be issues after 25 years. Any war plans are probably obsolete after 25 years, any secret technology must have leaked after 25 years, or at the very least is so far behind the curve that no one really cares about it anymore. Maybe information on spies needs to remain secret until the spy is dead? I feel like I must be missing some large group of secrets.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Missile silos do not move. I imagine we do not want NK to have 1995 US nuclear missile blue prints. A lot of hardware is that old and we do not want everyone to know everthing we know about it, even if it is a bit dated and slightly upgraded now.<br />
 I imagine we had some foreign assets, who do not quite qualify as spies, who helped us in the nineties who still would be prosecuted for their actions and even more who care about their reputation. Also if we bribed someone their children should not be able to be identified. I imagine in many countries even grandchildren of the soldier who sold secrets to the evil Americans so he could pay his mistress to keep silent would suffer somewhat reputationally.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If, in 1985, the CIA found out that the mayor&#8217;s aide of a medium-sized Russian city regularly committed unspeakable crime X and could be blackmailed for it, (or whatever) then they probably did so.  Said mayor possibly moves up the ranks and in 2010 is in the Duma or a cabinet minister or whatever, the information (and its secrecy) is even more valuable.  Even if the guy dies in 2015, we don&#8217;t want the Russians to know that a major reason why &#8216;Russia&#8217; decided that third party Mr. Z from Ukraine is reliable was because the CIA had their blackmailed former mayor vouch for him to Putin.  And Mr. Z and his people are still valuable assets that we want the Russians to continue to trust.  </p>
<p>I think you want to protect stuff like this forever, because if you&#8217;re doing it correctly, the foundations of today&#8217;s important secrets are built on decades-old secrets.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>One of the more plausible JFK conspiracy theories is that either Oswald was working with the Soviets, or at the very least parts of the US government thought he was, and that the cover up was to prevent World War III if that information went public.</p>
<p>(Fun fact &#8211; there is an audio tape from the LBJ presidential library of LBJ telling Senator Richard Russell that Earl Warren repeatedly refused to head the assassination investigation committee until LBJ revealed the then-secret information that Oswald went to Mexico City to have a meeting at the Soviet Embassy right before the assassination; LBJ claims Warren broke down crying and agreed to head the commission on the spot to prevent a nuclear war.)</p>
<p>On the one hand, you can see how they might want to keep something like that secret even now.</p>
<p>On the other hand, what I find weird is that although it hasn’t raised too much attention, the JFK files that have already been declassified include a surprisingly large amount of potentially damaging information- including a lot more stuff about Oswald’s Mexico City trip, the CIA’s attempts to cover it up (even from other parts of the government &#8211; one of the best declassified docs is Hoover losing his shit at the CIA trying to keep him in the dark about it), all kinds of fun stuff.</p>
<p>So if they can release all that already, it’s kind of hard to figure out what they are still sitting on.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p> any secret technology must have leaked after 25 years</p></blockquote>
<p>Not even remotely.  Say you&#8217;ve written a new algorithm to help a radar system sort out targets from the background under heavy jamming.  This one has a very specific vulnerability, but so long as nobody knows what it is, you&#8217;re fine.  (And there are a bunch of similar algorithms, with different vulnerabilities, so they can only exploit this if they know which one you picked.)  That radar is likely to stay in service for decades.  Why should we declassify?</p>
<p>High-level conceptual stuff like stealth isn&#8217;t going to stay secret forever, but there&#8217;s a lot of detail stuff which can stay secret in the long term and will be heavily compromised by disclosure.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Seems like there&#8217;s folks here more expert than me about the history of religions &#8211; a question.<br />
The big 3 Abrahamic religions are described as war-like, and history has a lot of wars between any pair of them &#8211; Hitler (Christian vs Jew), the Crusades (Christian vs Muslim), the current Middle East (Jew vs Muslim and Christian vs Muslim). Also some intra-religious wars &#8211; Catholics vs Protestants in England and Ireland, Sunnis vs Shia (and vs the often overlooked Sufis). But I don&#8217;t know of any intra-Jewish wars &#8211; are there any? If not, why not? I know the reformed and orthodox (and there&#8217;s others too) don&#8217;t always get along but do/did they ever come to violence?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m not an expert, but Jews are not just a religion but a tribe, at least for the early history, which precludes warring other than civil. Depending on how you incorporate biblical events into your idea of history, the new testament describes intra-Jewish conflict: between the elite who rule at the behest of the conquering Romans, and the zealots who reject their authority as they have compromised their religious purity. I think this takes a reading of Jesus in which he is more political than how he is often depicted now; after all, Roman politics don&#8217;t have any direct bearing on us today.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s entirely relevant, and maybe not even well sourced since I don&#8217;t remember where this is from, but I remember once seeing the interesting argument that the &#8220;Render unto Caesar&#8221; thing was actually just a rejection of the Roman coinage; essentially an argument for Jewish sovereignty, that they should have their own coins, and paying for sacrifices at the temple with Roman coins was religiously unacceptable. Thus, render unto Caesar what is Caesar&#8217;s means Caesar can have back his dirty coins with his face on them, render unto God what is God&#8217;s means legitimate Jewish coins would be used for religious purposes. I find the dynamics of Judaism under Roman rule to be quite interesting as they were uniquely unsuited to being incorporated into the Roman empire in the way pagan cultures were; it demonstrates how monotheism is such a powerful cultural technology, making Judea kind of ungovernable until the Romans dispersed them, then an offshoot captures that same empire and is still going strong today, and all the while Jewish identity hasn&#8217;t died out. With pagan cultures you could just capture their gods along with the people and territory; Roman attempts to do the same with the Jewish religion are so uncomfortable and don&#8217;t quite work right, but they still tried their strategy of letting people keep their religion but making it subordinate to imperial sovereignty.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Not quite &#8211; the Jewish religious authorities were <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Render_unto_Caesar" rel="nofollow ugc">leading Jesus into a trap</a> by asking him if it was lawful (under Jewish law) to pay taxes to the Roman empire.  If Jesus says yes his zealous Roman hating followers desert or turn on him.  If he says no he gets arrested. So he gives a clever answer instead.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that 1st century Judea had its own coinage, and that was what was required to pay temple tax in. It was the Roman to Jewish money changers that Jesus drove out of the temple &#8211; the face value reading is that they were turning a house if worship into a marketplace and taking advantage of worshipers, but I&#8217;ll admit to not knowing if there was another political motive to this as well or not.</p>

<p>Sufiism isn&#8217;t a sect in the sense in which Sunni an Shia are — a Sufi can be Sunni or Shia. The third group in the split were the Kharijites, but they were never very important after the very early period.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>There has been some small-scale violence between Orthodox and more secular Jews in Israel- AFAIK largely taking the form of Orthodox Jews throwing stones at buses that drive through Orthodox areas on the Sabbath.</p>
<p>Incidentally, no Jewish denomination describes itself as reformed (past tense). The older secular/modernising tendency is Reform. </p>
<p>Confusingly, in the US Reform is the most secular denomination, while in the UK it&#8217;s not. A reasonable approximation is that Reform Judaism in the US would be called Liberal or Progressive in the UK, while Reform Judaism in the UK overlaps with Conservative in the US.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Because Jews didn&#8217;t have a lot of territory to fight over, and you can&#8217;t really call it a &#8220;war&#8221; if you don&#8217;t hold territory.  There are some possibilities from Biblical times &#8211; the Samaritans, various wars between the tribes (such as the war between the Gileadites and Ephraimites, which gives us the word &#8220;shibboleth&#8221;) &#8211; but they&#8217;re so far back that we don&#8217;t have great historical records.  Heck, it&#8217;s a bit murky if &#8220;Judaism&#8221; as an identity actually stretches that far back!</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;re out of Biblical times, Israel is constantly occupied by one empire or another, so any hostility is mostly directed outwards.  Although there are some cases of violence towards Jews who sympathized with the occupying regime.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>As others have said, for most of the last two thousand years, Jews haven&#8217;t held enough organized political power to wage anything you would really want to call &#8220;a war&#8221;, but in pre-Roman and Roman times there were plenty of examples: the <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maccabean_Revolt" rel="nofollow ugc">Maccabean revolt</a> was at least in part also a war against Hellenizing Jews; the origins of modern Rabbinic Judaism come from the Pharisees, who warred with their rival Sadduccees (championed by the Hasmonean dynasty) in the <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judean_Civil_War" rel="nofollow ugc">Judean Civil War</a>; the <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Jewish%E2%80%93Roman_War" rel="nofollow ugc">Great Revolt</a> against Rome featured plenty of <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicarii" rel="nofollow ugc">factions</a> of Jews who were happy to use violence against each other.<br />
And of course, early persecution of Christians by Jews had a lot of the character of an intra-Jewish dispute until Christianity fully branched off and became its own religion.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ve been thinking lately that I want a physics professor I can bother with a dumb question, and then I realized there are probably people here qualified to answer this. So, I have just been apprised of how electricity and magnetism are united by relativity. I have a cursory understanding, I don&#8217;t actually know all the math that makes this stuff work, but I guess there&#8217;s a nice neat way in which they balance out when relativistic effects can make things like net charge or current look different in different reference frames. My understanding (after going through the apparently common fallacy of wondering if this meant magnetism was just a consequence of relativistic effects on charge; I guess magnetism is just weird and everyone&#8217;s subconscious desire is to make it go away) is that basically relativity means that charge implies magnetism, magnetism implies charge, you can&#8217;t get one to work without the other, and this allows for charge invariance between reference frames. Without one or the other, you&#8217;d get cases where in one reference frame a particle should undergo a force, but in another frame the force just disappears.</p>
<p>My question, for someone who knows the math on this stuff better, is: can you create a framework in which the general principles of relativity hold, charge and electrostatic force exist, but magnetism doesn&#8217;t? I feel like maybe if you get rid of charge invariance and allow for different reference frames to measure charges differently, you could get a mathematically complete system; and of course this might just break more stuff, and how that stuff breaks would give a satisfying answer as to why magnetism must exist. Then again, if the speed of light is the fixed point for conversion between reference frames, and light is an electromagnetic wave, maybe it&#8217;s fundamentally flawed to try and come up with a relativistic framework at all, at least based on light, in which magnetism doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>I would find it edifying to know how much has to change, or even whether in the end you&#8217;ll never quite get such a system to be consistent. The more things are intuitively implied by how the math behind them works out, the less arbitrary and mystifying these phenomena seem; e.g. inverse square laws aren&#8217;t at all arbitrary, they&#8217;re clearly implied by three dimensional space, and you can see how they would change in a space with more or fewer spatial dimensions.</p>
<p>Btw, apropos of nothing, my very imprecise back of the envelope calculation says that if 0.00000000000000009% (16 zeroes right of the decimal) of the masses of the sun and earth were each unmatched protons (i.e. no electron so each has a certain charge as a proportion of its mass), then the gravitational and electrostatic forces would balance out.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure what you mean by magnetism not existing. You can certainly imagine there being no ferromagnetic materials but that&#8217;s more of a chemistry/condensed matter thing. But as far as a vacuum goes I don&#8217;t really see how. The Maxwell equations just jump out of relativity as soon as you assume an electrical charge</p>
<p>There is also a misconception here regarding the speed of light: There is nothing inherently special about light in relativity, it&#8217;s just that any massless field propagates at the maximal possible speed. This speed in relativity would still exist and make sense if photons had some rest mass and would not be able to move at it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>No.  You can&#8217;t have instantaneous propagation of the electrostatic force in relativity, and without magnetism, this causes problems.</p>
<p>Imagine two electrons sitting side by side, one on the left, one on the right.  They should experience a 1/r^2 force repelling them, which points directly to the left and right respectively.  With the finite speed of light, the magnitude of the force is dependent on the retarded positions, but it always points directly to the left and right respectively, because they&#8217;re always directly to the left and right of each other.  In this frame, you should always see them accelerating away from each other, but they should remain motionless in the orthogonal directions.</p>
<p>Now, transform into a moving frame, so that you&#8217;re moving downward with respect to the two charges.  The retarded position of the charges in this frame are always a little bit below their current positions, so the direction of the two forces is up and to the left and up and to the right.  This means they should be accelerating upward as well as away from each other.</p>
<p>If they&#8217;re accelerating upward in this frame, that means they would have to be accelerating upward in the original frame as well.  Obviously this doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>Besides, electromagnetism is described so beautifully under relativity as either a vector potential or tensor fields that transform according to the Lorentz group.  Why would you want to change that?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Thank you ksteel and mcpalenik for your replies and for indulging my crankery. I&#8217;m going to take your responses as a recommendation to actually work through the relationship between relativity and Maxwell&#8217;s equations (might have to learn some math for a change). ksteel, thanks for clearing up my confusion regarding light; mcpalenik, that is an elegant and simple counterfactual, I will have to try to work through exactly how magnetism corrects it, but it&#8217;s pretty clear that no model of relativistic charge is going to fix a simple, symmetrical case where switching reference frames causes a force to appear.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>A really good simple example to get started thinking about this is two parallel wires carrying a current. Parallel wires carrying current generate a small amount of force between them.  The force can either repel the wires, or attract them together, depending on whether the currents are running in the same direction or opposite.  This is an easily verifiable physical fact, though you need quite a lot of current to make it obvious to feel with your hand, so probably don&#8217;t try it yourself unless you know what you are doing around large amounts of electricity.</p>
<p>How do we explain this phenomenon if we are allowed to use magnetism?  Easy!  One of the rules of magnetism is that current flowing through a wire generates a magnetic field.  Another rule of magnetism is that a wire with a current inside a magnetic field feels a force.  We have two wires with currents, each creating a magnetic field and being pushed/pulled by the magnetic field from the other.  Thus we expect a force between the two wires.  Done!</p>
<p>But can we explain this phenomenon without using magnetism, and only using electrostatics and relativity?  Yes, but it is harder.  We need to explain this force in terms of electrostatic repulsion, so lets refine our model of a current carrying wire.  A current carrying wire is made out of positively charged metal ions mixed up in a sea of negatively charged electrons.  There is one negative electron for every positive metal ion, so there is no net electrical force.  This is easily verifiable in the lab reference frame where we live; we can measure the static electric field around a current carrying wire, and see that there is none.  So a current carrying wire is a density-balanced set of positive and negative charges when viewed in the lab reference frame, and we expect to see no force whatsoever, and are confused when we measure a force between these two current carrying wires.</p>
<p>But so far, we haven&#8217;t thought about relativity at all.  Lets do that!  The electrons are moving.  What do things look like from their perspective?  If we want to talk about the forces acting on the electrons, we have to switch to their reference frame, which is what relativity is all about.  When we shift to a moving reference frame, space contracts; that&#8217;s one of the fundamental features of relativity.  But if space contracts, so does electric charge density!  We know that positive and negative charge density are equal in the lab frame.  But as we move to the electron frame, the positive metal ions and the moving current-causing electrons get different Lorentz contractions.  Which means that their densities change by different amounts.  Which means that the wire is no longer electrically neutral!  There is now a net electrical charge on the wire, and since there is a net electrical charge on the wire, in the electron reference frame we see an electrostatic force between the wires.</p>
<p>So in the lab frame, from the perspective of the positive metal ions, everything is charge balanced, and there should be no force between the wires.  But the negative electrons aren&#8217;t living in the lab reference frame, because they are moving, so in order to model them, we have to switch to their reference frame.  And switching into their reference frame causes the previously balanced positive and negative charge distributions to become unbalanced (because they get different Lorentz contractions).  So the electrons live in this world where the electrical charges are not balanced, and there are electrostatic forces pushing / pulling them around.  Thus the electrons end up getting push/pulled toward one side of the wire.  They pile up on that side, and eventually start exerting a force on the wire itself, which we can then measure as the force exerted between the two wires.  And so we can reach agreement.  There should indeed be a force between the two current carrying wires.  Even though we didn&#8217;t talk about magnetism at all!</p>
<p>So&#8230; Everything about magnetism can actually be explained by special relativity and electrostatic forces.  Magnetism is always about something moving.  And when something is moving, you have to switch reference frames to the moving thing&#8217;s reference frame to see how it will react to forces.  And when you switch reference frames, you get Lorentz contractions.  And Lorentz contractions will cause previously balanced positive and negative charge densities to become no-longer balanced, because the Lorentz contractions occur in different directions, or at different speeds.  And where you have un-balanced charge distributions, you will have electrostatic forces.  And these forces must persist as you change reference frames back into the lab frame.  These persistent forces are called magnetic forces.</p>
<p>So you can think about magnetism as being un-fundamental &#8211; it&#8217;s just a derived phenomenon that arises when you apply special relativity to electrostatics.  But it is vastly easier to use the derived laws of magnetism than it would be to stick with electrostatics and keeping track of all these damn Lorentz contractions.  And as mcpalenik says, the mathematics of the magnetic vector potential / four-potential are elegant, and much more practical for solving problems.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>This example of Lorentz contraction changing charge densities was actually the example that I first encountered that put me down the road of thinking about this. But when I looked this up I did see the caution in a couple places that in no case will a reference frame switch ever turn a purely electrostatic force into a purely magnetic one or vice versa, it can only turn it into a mixture.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That doesn&#8217;t seem right.</p>
<p>Consider a charge moving next to a wire and experiencing a magnetic force. Then, shift to the frame where there charge is still. Since it&#8217;s still, there <i>can&#8217;t</i> be a magnetic force, so the force must be all electric.</p>
<p>Maybe you meant &#8220;switch a purely electric field into a purely magnetic field&#8221;? I don&#8217;t know that&#8217;s right, but I don&#8217;t know it&#8217;s wrong either.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>There are two invariant quantities in the relativistic theory of magnetism: E*B (dot product) and E^2 &#8211; B^2, in units where c=1.  These appear as invariant scalars that can be derived from the Faraday tensor and its dual.</p>
<p>So, if you start with a purely electric field, you can&#8217;t turn it into a purely magnetic field, because E^2 &#8211; B^2 &gt; 0 in any reference frame.  Likewise, if you start with a purely magnetic field, E^2 &#8211; B^2 &lt; 0 in any reference frame.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>can you create a framework in which the general principles of relativity hold, charge and electrostatic force exist, but magnetism doesn’t?</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes! This is a great question and leads to some really deep physics. If you have a theory describing a field, like the electromagnetic field, then for it to be compatible with special relativity you need<br />
1. An equation that says how the field looks different if you move to a different reference frame [For example in electromagnetism an electric field in one reference frame will look like a combination of electric and magnetic fields in another reference frame, and there&#8217;s a equation that tells you how to calculate this].<br />
2. A proof that, while the field looks different in different reference frames, the field obeys the same *equations* in all reference frames [because in relativity all inertial reference frames are supposed to be on an equal footing, and the same laws of physics are supposed to hold in each frame.]</p>
<p>The requirement that the same equations have to hold in all reference frames is a strong one. Physicists have used group theory to carefully enumerate the possible equations that satisfy these requirements, and basically came up with 4 possibilities.</p>
<p>1. Maxwell&#8217;s equations.</p>
<p>2. The Klein-Gordon equation. It&#8217;s simpler than Maxwell&#8217;s equations: just one equation instead of 4! The Klein-Gordon equation sounds like what you want: it describes a force that has something like electrostatic attraction but no equivalent of magnetism. A popular image of its field is that it&#8217;s like a soft mattress. &#8220;Charges&#8221; are like weights that pull down parts of the mattress, and so charges are attracted to each other because they want to roll downhill.</p>
<p>3. The Einstein field equations for gravity. These are more complicated than Maxwell&#8217;s equations, so kind of the opposite of what you were asking for.</p>
<p>4. The Dirac equation, which mathematically is similar in complexity to Maxwell&#8217;s equations but is conceptually much weirder.</p>
<p>It turns out that nature uses all four of these. Electromagnetism is described by Maxwell&#8217;s equations, and the strong and weak forces are also described by versions of Maxwell&#8217;s equations. The Higgs boson is described by the Klein-Gordon equation. Gravity is described by the Einstein equations. And particles like electrons and quarks are described by the Dirac equation.</p>
<p>In quantum mechanics you can prove some deep theorems about these various kinds of fields. I&#8217;m not an expert on them but they roughly say:<br />
&#8211; These four are the only possibilities.<br />
&#8211; There can only be one field obeying the Einstein equations, and it has to be gravity.<br />
&#8211; It&#8217;s very unlikely to have a field obeying the Klein-Gordon equation that is strong at long distances; for example the Higgs field produces a force between any two passive particles but it decays exponentially with their separation past about 1e-18 meters.</p>
<p>The last point is why the forces we are familiar with, electromagnetism and gravity, obey the complicated Maxwell and Einstein equations instead of the simple Klein-Gordon equation. Klein-Gordon fields like you asked for get hidden at very small distances because of quantum mechanics.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Wow, this is really helpful! One thing I notice is that one of the forces which works over long distances is mediated by a massless particle (electromagnetic force and photons), and gravity as far as I know doesn&#8217;t have a well-understood carrier particle but the graviton would also be theorized to be massless. I&#8217;m assuming that&#8217;s not a coincidence. I vaguely remember that the nature of EM waves as self-propagating is a consequence of Maxwell&#8217;s equations, is that necessary for photons being massless? I imagine that any construction of electric charge without magnetism under the Klein-Gordon equation would behave very differently.</p>
<p>Also, I looked up the Einstein field equations&#8230;they seem nasty. I haven&#8217;t gotten my head around whether they&#8217;re incredibly difficult to solve, or in some cases actually unsolvable, or maybe proving whether a case is solvable or not is itself incredibly difficult. And in any case, if we can&#8217;t figure out one of the terms in the equation (cosmological constant), how can we possibly have ANY solutions? I guess maybe they&#8217;re the solutions under a particular value of the constant?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>One thing I notice is that one of the forces which works over long distances is mediated by a massless particle</p></blockquote>
<p>Yup!<br />
&#8211; Fields mediated by massless particles correspond to forces that fall off like 1/r^2, like the electrostatic force and the gravitational force.<br />
&#8211; Fields mediated by massive particles correspond to forces that fall off roughly like e^(-r/L) where the distance L is roughly h/(mc) [h=planck&#8217;s constant, c=speed of light, m=particle mass].</p>
<blockquote><p>I vaguely remember that the nature of EM waves as self-propagating is a consequence of Maxwell’s equations, is that necessary for photons being massless?</p></blockquote>
<p>Just having propagating waves doesn&#8217;t by itself mean that we&#8217;re dealing with a massless particle. The Klein-Gordon equation has freely propagating wave solutions, similar to electromagnetic waves, and when you bring quantum mechanics into it those correspond to a moving *massive* particle (e.g. the Higgs boson). </p>
<p>But in any case it&#8217;s not an accident that photons are massless: I think it&#8217;s hard to modify Maxwell&#8217;s equations to make photons massive and still end up with a sensible theory.</p>
<blockquote><p>if we can’t figure out one of the terms in the equation (cosmological constant), how can we possibly have ANY solutions?</p></blockquote>
<p>Well the cosmological constant is very small; the only case where its effects are noticeable is when you&#8217;re looking at the expansion of the universe as a whole over billions of years. So if you&#8217;re just looking at the solar system or a black hole or something you can pretend the cosmological constant is zero.</p>
<p>Even so, the equations are indeed annoying to solve and only the simplest cases have analytic solutions: for example a black hole with no other masses nearby, or the expansion of the universe filled with a uniform gas. If things are actually *happening*, then you need to use approximations (which can work well for cases like the solar system where nothing too crazy is going on) or numerical simulations (for cases where gravity gets very strong, like black hole collisions).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I suppose my &#8220;no&#8221; that I gave you earlier could maybe become a *very* qualified yes, but not in the classical (meaning non-quantum) limit, because the reasoning I gave still holds.  The electromagnetism-like thing that Anatid described involving scalar fields is called the Yukawa interaction&#8211;which I did honestly forget about when I wrote my first reply, because I haven&#8217;t really thought at all about that type of physics since grad school.</p>
<p>The non-relativistic, classical limit of the Yukawa interaction is usually given as something like -e^(-mr)/r, where m is the mass of the scalar field that carries the force.</p>
<p>The problem is, when dealing with classical particles, the acceleration has to be orthogonal to something called the 4-velocity, which includes not only the the spacial directions but a time component as well.  The reason for this is that the magnitude of the 4-velocity is the mass of a particle and always has to be preserved.  In electromagnetism, this works because of the nature of the vector potential and the fact that the fields are described by an antisymmetric tensor.  The Yukawa potential is scalar, however, and in short, this means that the interaction *doesn&#8217;t* classically preserve the magnitude of the 4-velocity.</p>
<p>Effectively, this means that in the classical limit it has to vanish, as Anatid pointed out.</p>
<blockquote><p>Also, I looked up the Einstein field equations…they seem nasty. I haven’t gotten my head around whether they’re incredibly difficult to solve, or in some cases actually unsolvable</p></blockquote>
<p>A lot of physics can&#8217;t really be solved analytically, including analytic solutions for the regular old 1/r^2 interaction between particles.  For example, you can&#8217;t solve the Schrodinger equation analytically with 3 or more interacting particles.</p>
<p>The Einstein equation is particularly nasty because it&#8217;s non-linear, but as with all things, the it&#8217;s sometimes tractable when you can exploit symmetries.  Finding the Schwarzchild (stationary black hole) solution, for example, isn&#8217;t trivial, but it&#8217;s easier than you&#8217;d think.  Easy enough that it can be assigned as a homework problem, anyway.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Not a speaker of modern Hebrew, which is more relevant.  But I do read the Hebrew Bible well enough to get by.</p>
<p>In Biblical Hebrew, the word shows up in Ecclesiastes 3 times.</p>
<p>1:15, What is crooked cannot be made straight.  (so, making straight metaphorically, in the context of everything under the sun being messed up.)</p>
<p>7:13, Consider the work of God:  who can make straight what he has made crooked. (same)</p>
<p>12:9, Weighing and studying and arranging many proverbs with great care (so setting a text in order).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m leaving out the Daniel 4 use because I think that is Aramaic, and I don&#8217;t actually know that language however much it sort of looks like Hebrew.</p>
<p>Outside the Bible, I&#8217;ve seen rabbis use it for everything from prayers to make up for some breach in the covenant to what to pray to make up for a wet dream.  But the use you are looking for is from early Jewish sources, describing legislation intended to protect vulnerable classes in society.  That use is, so far as I know, the one that got picked up and modified last century.  Also, it came with a different form of the word olam.</p>
<p>A completely different way of saying this is that the tricky word in tikkun olam is not tikkun.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think this is probably the best answer; there are some Hebrew nouns that take various suffixes that sort of function like &#8220;-ist&#8221; or &#8220;-er&#8221; in English, transforming a noun into &#8216;one who performs that noun&#8217;. But the prefix &#8220;me-&#8221; I think is more common and more regular than any of those prefixes. Though I would pronounce it more like &#8220;meh-takken&#8221; than &#8220;mi-takken&#8221;.</p>
<p>However, I want to throw in a quick pitch for Tikkunnik, which would be the Yiddish version; the &#8220;-nik&#8221; suffix is pretty close to &#8220;-er&#8221; in English, and is pretty commonly used today (see Likudnik for supporters of the political party Likud).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ve been looking into what the Earth&#8217;s future climate might look like and what the net effect will be in terms of arable land opened up from added warmth vs. closed down due to heat and drought.  </p>
<p>I found <a rel="nofollow"href="http://www.gloh2o.org/wp-content/uploads/ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif" rel="nofollow ugc">this gif</a> that nicely toggles back and forth between the current Koppen climate zones vs. the forecasted ones from 2071-2100 (although I&#8217;m not sure which IPCC scenario this gif is using).  And then I found <a rel="nofollow"href="https://i.redd.it/g9w7hffywns11.png" rel="nofollow ugc">this diagram</a> which closely aligns with the previous and which happens to mention that this is based off 4C average warming.</p>
<p>Eyeballing the two, here are the changes I notice:</p>
<p>Pros:<br />
*Large parts of Alaska and Canada and Siberia become like modern-day New England.<br />
*Taiga expands into the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and parts of northern Siberia that are currently tundra.<br />
*Iceland becomes a lot nicer.<br />
*Tibet and northern China become a lot more hospitable. </p>
<p>Cons:<br />
*In India, the hot arid Aw zone (savanna) encroaches into the temperate Cwa zones there.<br />
*The Amazon rainforest shrinks substantially.<br />
*Southern Africa becomes drier.<br />
*Australia&#8217;s desert enlarges slightly; the coastal humid zone gets squeezed, albeit not eliminated.<br />
*Northern Mexico and West Texas become drier.<br />
*The Sahara desert enlarges slightly, especially in North Africa around the Atlas Mountains.<br />
*Steppe and desert encroach into southern Spain.<br />
*Iran and Turkenistan become noticeably hotter (although not necessarily drier—their current warm dry zones become hot dry zones).  </p>
<p>Neutral to slightly bad:<br />
*Most of Europe between Spain and Scandanavia gets a Mediterranean climate (although this could be a plus depending on whom you ask, other than the fact that agriculture in those areas would need to adjust.  In any case, it&#8217;s not as if these areas are going to become uninhabitable or even uncomfortable, unless you consider modern-day Italy uncomfortable).  </p>
<p>Overall, what I&#8217;m seeing is that the Earth loses some arable land, but also gains a bunch of arable land.  If I knew how, I&#8217;d use a program to count the number of pixels that change in that gif for each color to see exactly how the two compare.  That said, we all know that land is not easily fungible, and there will be geopolitical winners and losers, and conflict as a result.  But I&#8217;m not quite seeing how this is going to be the end of the world, unless the methane in Siberian permafrost really does trigger a runaway greenhouse effect.  It doesn&#8217;t even look like total global agricultural productivity would go down; if anything, it would go up from the new arable land at high latitudes.  Am I missing something?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Lots of missing pieces here:  massive loss of biodiversity being one of the larger items.  If all you value is growing more food then are probably better ways of doing so without gobbling up the last acre of arable land.  I, for one, place a much greater value on wilderness and the beauty and diversity embodied within it than I do on growing more cheap food to feed a rapacious civilization.  We&#8217;re closing in on what&#8230;8 billion people&#8230;.?  Probably way more than enough to ensure our continued advances in knowledge while preserving human diversity.  We could probably shed a few billion and still have good results if we ensured those 5 billion had a good standard of living.<br />
So what you&#8217;re missing is that the essential ingredients of truly living include much more than just having enough to eat.  For me one of those ingredients is the high value I place on wild places that includes putting on a pair of skis and skiing into a place of solitude and beauty.  I also value the things we benefit from in a very bio-diverse world.  We are still discovering new species and no doubt we&#8217;ve lost countless ones before they were even &#8216;discovered.&#8217;<br />
A local farmer that farms &#8216;naturally&#8217; has discovered without the advice of scientists the benefits of a bio-diverse land to the health of the plants he grows for food.  It was a Eureka Moment for his family to discover the interconnected nature of the animals and plants that ensured the health of his soil.<br />
We should learn to take a bit better care of this rock we call home if we want anywhere close to the current 8 billion souls to have any sort of a decent life.<br />
On the practical side, energy usage would have to go waaaay up unless you think all those swampy Floridians are going to give up their air conditioning.  Already, homes built just a decade ago in my area were usually built without central a/c.  Now, no builder in their right mind would build a home in central NY state without it.   I don&#8217;t have the figures but should be easy to determine how much of the energy savings from more efficient appliances, lighting, and insulation was gobbled back by the need for a/c.<br />
I suppose you&#8217;d just tell them all to move to Canada where it will (in your scenario) be a temperate place.  I&#8217;m sure the Canadians will be all fine with that or will the massive disruptions to culture and national identity be so effectively erased as to cause us all to fall in on the One World Govt?  (ok that&#8217;s a bit snarky).<br />
I think we also very much discount the upheavals likely to occur even in a mild climate change scenario.  As has been noted elsewhere over and over: &#8216;you can change the org chart all you want but culture change is very very difficult.&#8217;<br />
I like the world the way it is and am willing to give up quite a bit to keep it that way.  I&#8217;m hoping to convince more of my fellow humans to take up the cause as well.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That&#8217;s a good point about biodiversity.  One thing I&#8217;d be concerned about is whether plant and animal species can migrate and establish themselves over such geographical distances over the span of a few decades.  I wonder how much manpower it would take to shepherd plant and animal species to the new climate zones and get them established over transition periods lasting decades&#8230;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>whether plant and animal species can migrate and establish themselves over such geographical distances over the span of a few decades.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think a few decades is likely to have enough change so that all of a species&#8217; range becomes uninhabitable for that species. The most likely problem, in my view, is immobile species with long generations, i.e. trees. That aside, unless movement is blocked by geographical barriers, I would expect the range of species of plants and animals to gradually shift towards the poles.</p>

<p>How much of that do you do at present in northern Siberia, northern Alaska, and similar places?</p>
<p>When temperature contours move towards the poles, one result is that areas that were wild because the climate wasn&#8217;t suited for agriculture get turned into farmland. Another is that places where essentially nobody went become warm enough for people who like visiting the wild but still not warm enough for agriculture.</p>
<p>Or in other words, I think your attitude reflects a large conservative bias, thinking not in terms of wild lands suited to skiing on but of the particular wild lands where you now ski.</p>
<p>So far as I can tell, most of the loss of biodiversity isn&#8217;t coming from climate change but from human land use.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p><i>the high value I place on wild places that includes putting on a pair of skis and skiing into a place of solitude and beauty.</i></p>
<p>Which you are disrupting by strapping on your skis and tromping all over it, not to mention (a) the necessity of the technical civilisation to manufacture your skis (unless you&#8217;re strapping chunks of wood to your feet), the roads to get you there from where you live to the wild place, the resorts that you inhabit before/after skiing (unless, again, you&#8217;re only driving out to the mountain for a day&#8217;s skiiing and then driving back home) &#8211; you would do more for the biodiversity and integrity of the wild place by staying at home than turning it into a facility for your enjoyment.</p>
<p>Mankind has reached everywhere, and your attitude towards the (accessible) &#8220;wild places&#8221; is one of exploitation: they exist on sufferance so long as tourists like you can extract a sense of the sublime from them.  You are as much complicit as the rest of us, and I&#8217;m going to quote from Gerard Manley Hopkins&#8217; &#8220;God&#8217;s Grandeur&#8221; at you:</p>
<blockquote><p>Generations have trod, have trod, have trod;<br />
And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil;<br />
And wears man&#8217;s smudge and shares man&#8217;s smell: the soil<br />
Is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod.</p></blockquote>
<p><i>I like the world the way it is and am willing to give up quite a bit to keep it that way. I’m hoping to convince more of my fellow humans to take up the cause as well.</i></p>
<p>Will you give up your skiiing trips?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Since much of my enjoyment of my outdoor environment occurs right outside my back door&#8230;..<br />
Without a doubt tourism in many places is a scourge which is why I keep my &#8216;footprint&#8217; as light as possible.  No, camping and hiking isn&#8217;t for everyone but for me, it&#8217;s worth a great deal.  As I&#8217;ve said elsewhere, I was lucky to grow up in Europe and the military took me all over the world.  I&#8217;ve been in lots of the &#8216;great&#8217; buildings and cathedrals of the world but nothing compares to an old-growth forest and the serenity of a wild place.  We&#8217;ll just have to disagree on the value of that.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think that would work. The map projection distorts the size of land closer to the poles, which would exaggerate the amount of arable land we are gaining. Better to look for the numbers they are basing it on.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>As I understand it, the big problem with climate change is that it&#8217;s a change. If we had a new planet to settle having it be a few degrees warmer than here would be fine, maybe even better. But here we have a planet with established farms and infrastructure, and having the arable regions move is a big problem. Likewise rising sea levels aren&#8217;t bad because there&#8217;s anything particularly wrong with the new coast, it&#8217;s just that we have a lot of people living on the old coast.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That would be a big problem for rapid change. Warming so far has been about a tenth of a degree C/decade, sea level rise about an inch a decade. The IPCC believes the rate is going to be higher for the rest of this century, but still slow relative to the speed with which humans adjust their behavior — farmers changing crop varieties, for example, or increasing or decreasing irrigation. It isn&#8217;t as if we don&#8217;t know how to deal with climates a little warmer than they now are — roughly speaking, we&#8217;re talking about warming Minnesota to the current temperature of Iowa.</p>
<p>The rule of thumb for the U.S. east coast is that a foot of SLR shifts the coastline by a hundred feet. The high end of the IPCC projection as of the most recent version of the report, on the (designed as an unlikely high) RCP 8.5 emissions scenario is about a meter. Shifting the coastline in by a hundred meters over most of a century is not rapid change. There are a few places, such as the Nile delta, where the result is considerably larger and others where it is smaller.</p>
<p>The argument is a more persuasive one for non-human species. Trees can&#8217;t shift their range very fast, and we don&#8217;t know how fast oceanic organisms can adapt to the ocean becoming less basic.</p>

<p>But is the reason for lack of development of a good topsoil the climate? If the area warmed up, would plants grow faster then die, adding organic matter? Yes, this process takes an incredibly long time, but we&#8217;re learning how to speed these things up. Most of the old colliery mine spoil in the UK is being reclaimed by cover crops.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;ll take a long time to get former tundra fertile enough to grow crops, but converting it to pasture for livestock will be faster (especially if we seed it with the correct moorland flora).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;Despite a generous harvest from the sea, the land in Plockton at this time was not considered to be of very good quality.

<p>I&#8217;m not saying it would be impossible to adapt it ever. But it would be a huge undertaking, involving clearing a lot of forests or creating a lot of soil where there presently is none.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve reported your post because it is a blatant &#8216;gotcha&#8217; type post, unhelpful in every way. It would have been fine if you asked him about why he got the prediction wrong, and what he thinks of it now, in a polite way that could start a good discussion about prediction in general.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Other than the peaking audio on the high notes of the Mozart he put at the beginning&#8230;</p>
<p>But yeah, I&#8217;ve seen this guy&#8217;s videos before. I appreciate clever variant sudoku puzzles, I might check this out and pause the video to solve it myself; I did this with a previous one which I really enjoyed, but he&#8217;s got so many on the channel I don&#8217;t think I could find it again, and I can&#8217;t remember the gimmick. An early programming assignment had me writing a program to solve sudokus which pretty well inoculated me against wanting to solve them by hand, but killer sudokus were interesting until they became rote, so now I occasionally look for a nice gimmick one to play with.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It could be if you make it smart, but I recall mine would just start with everything being tracked as possible in all the squares, strike the obvious ones which were in the same row/column/cell, fill in whatever it could at that point; then it didn&#8217;t do anything clever, it just guessed from top to bottom number by number, going down each chain until it hit a contradiction, then backed up the tree of guesses and tried something different. So, a decent introductory programming exercise, but not too interesting from the puzzle aspect. To this day though if I can&#8217;t actually fill something in on one of these puzzles by being clever, and I would have to guess and see if I run into a contradiction, I&#8217;ll just stop, I never feel like finishing after that; not that the puzzle necessarily turned into that, but I&#8217;d rather give up than solve with guessing if I can&#8217;t figure something out.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>@matkoniecz I guess I just wanted to caution that if you program it the basic way it&#8217;s not so interesting from the perspective of someone who likes doing the puzzles and might disillusion you on them, but definitely a good basic programming challenge.</p>
<p>Speaking of childhood programming memories, I remember when I was doing a similar depth-first search algorithm to figure out the shortest route between two points in a sokoban-like (block pushing) game, and having a terrible bug that made the output totally chaotic. I spent a couple days debugging it, and I didn&#8217;t know how to use tools so I just put in increasingly verbose print statements and tracking the variables. Basically, I learned the difference between pass by value and pass by reference the hard way; I was passing this array (well, the reference to it) into a function recursively and doing a bunch of stuff to it, then expecting it to be the same when the program returned a level.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I actually did solve this puzzle myself; it was ok. I think it was sort of geared towards looking crazy at first and having very little filled in. I don&#8217;t think you have to think about it very hard to realize that given the setup, the rule about sequential digits which works both up and down is actually only going to work in one direction, and basically the puzzle&#8217;s over if you can figure out where the 3s go. At one point I was thinking that this puzzle might be more interesting if you had numbers filled in from both the high and low points, but I also started to notice a pattern to how the numbers were being filled in. I haven&#8217;t taken the time to fully work through this, but it&#8217;s like those simple math tricks where you let someone think of a number and then do a bunch of arithmetic to it and guess what they end up with, but no matter what they start with they end up with the same result. Essentially the ruleset is so restrictive that one number being filled in almost implies all the other ones, but there are two possible &#8216;orientations&#8217; for the result, and any second number locks in which is being used; probably the fact that it&#8217;s solvable from only two numbers proves that, but again I didn&#8217;t work through proving all this. Anyway, it&#8217;s definitely not an interesting ruleset for more than one puzzle.</p>
<p>tl;dr my review is that it was fun to figure out the ruleset, tedious and trivial to apply it once I figured it out, and there isn&#8217;t a way to make a more interesting puzzle using these rules</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Can I, uh, ask a really dumb question, based on my total lack of scientific understanding? (Background, I have a college degree in the social sciences, but didn&#8217;t take physics in high school or any hard science in college). How do proposed spacecraft propulsion systems actually work in space- with no atmosphere to &#8216;push against&#8217;?</p>
<p>My naive physics/probably totally invented mental model of how propulsion systems work on a planet is that the chemical explosion or what have you is &#8216;pushing&#8217; against the atmosphere. In the void of space- if you generate any kind of propulsion, whether it&#8217;s chemical or a solar sail or nuclear thermal explosion, or what have you- so you&#8217;ve created a powerful controlled reaction, so what. Without anything to push against&#8230;. Does that make sense? Can anyone explain the basic idea to someone at my level of scientific education?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s not about pushing against the atmosphere. It&#8217;s about action-reaction. If you stand on a skateboard (or some other low-friction surface) and throw a weight backward, you and the skateboard will start moving (accelerate) forward. A rocket throws burning gas backward in order to accelerate forward by the same principle.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yes, it would. The effect is not dependent on being in an atmosphere.</p>
<p>You can test it if you want to. You don&#8217;t have to use a skateboard. Roller skates, ice skates on ice, or a canoe in still water are all systems with low enough friction to illustrate the principle. Just use a hefty weight, like a medicine ball or 10 kg sack of rice.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>OK thanks, yeah I can comprehend that. Explosion is pushing rocket forward, no atmosphere required.</p>
<p>In that case- it must actually be more efficient in space, right? With nothing to slow the rocket/craft, no friction or atmosphere</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The specifics of that are better explained by a legit smart person, but yes &#8211; my understanding is that the only substantial thing keeping you from getting to light speed at that point is the thing where it takes infinite amounts of power to get there even in ideal situations. Basically besides some relatively small effects you get to keep most of what you put in. </p>
<p>One of the practical upshots of this is if you are going somewhere in space you have to keep half of your fuel to slow down with or you end up bashing into whatever you are visiting real hard.</p>

<p>Seems to me if you want to get anywhere interesting at any decent rate, you&#8217;re definitely going to come out poor in such a collision. Surely some deceleration beats arriving in an extinction event?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t know when the last time we actually recovered something intact from orbit was. Most launches these days are for satellites, and those are there to stay. The space shuttle missions and the MSL mission that delivered the Curiosity rover to mars both slowed down by slamming into the atmosphere really hard. Neither of those could have carried nearly enough fuel to shed their orbital velocity. Instead they carried heat shields.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure about the Apollo missions, since the moon has virtually no atmosphere. Presumably the moons reduced mass means lunar orbit can be maintained at a much slower speed than Earth orbit, so it took less fuel to drop out of it.</p>

<p>Lunar landing only takes about 1.7Km/s but you can&#8217;t aerobrake.  </p>
<p>If it&#8217;s a body with moons, you can often shave some delta-v off with slingshot maneuvres.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Another way to think about it, that my intuition says is true but I haven&#8217;t done the math on, is that the center of mass of the entire system (propellant + dry mass) does not move.  Imagine a rocket filled with propellant on an infinite 2-D table.  If you light then engine then it starts throwing mass out of the nozzle at very high speeds.  If the CM (of the rocket and all of the propellant mass as well) is to stay in the same spot, the rocket must move forward.  Stop the engine and the rocket stops accelerating (it still will move forward, and the propellant exhaust gas will still be moving backward, forever).  The speed of the exhaust gas molecules will be different than each other, but if you take the average speed multiplied by the total gas mass, you should get a value that&#8217;s the same as the rocket&#8217;s speed times it&#8217;s remaining mass. </p>
<p>If that satisfies your intuition, re-imagine it in 3D.  Real rockets don&#8217;t do exactly this because even in space they and their exhaust gases are acted upon by outside forces, particularly gravity.</p>
<p>If your rocket was in very very deep space and not in orbit about a star or the galactic core, (or if it was the only object in the universe) then the entire system would behave like this &#8211; you could exit the rocket, theoretically fix yourself at the CG of the system and watch the exhaust gas fly past you and disappear in one direction and the rocket disappear in the other direction, continuously throwing new exhaust gas past your location.   As a system, though, it doesn&#8217;t move.  It just gets really really stretched out.</p>
<p>Note that this is with Newtonian physics only &#8211; it would break down as you approach relativistic effects.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Does anyone know how to set up a basic blog with Jekyll on a Github project page? I expected everything to just work, but after hours of troubleshooting, I still haven&#8217;t been able to get it to work. And even more frustrating, none of the documentation I&#8217;ve been able to find suggests anyone might have the slightest difficulty setting it up, let alone how to fix the issues that come up.</p>
<p>The current status is that the index page containing the list of posts will load. However, there is no CSS and all the links to posts are broken. Everything 404s. Based on my research, it seems like this might be an issue with baseurl, but I have no idea how to fix this, because this is A) something that literally every user with a project page will run into and thus presumably something that should already Just Work, and B) it&#8217;s not like I touched anything anyway. As far as I can tell, all the relevant urls are just magically generated by Jekyll somewhere, and I have no idea how I could even change them.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>In a previous OT, <a rel="nofollow"href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/05/20/open-thread-154-25/#comment-900888">Aftagley said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is where the political slant of Cracked started to rise – it wasn’t that they explicitly wanted more leftist thought on the platform, it was that a group of people who all happened to lean left were now given more editorial freedom to write opinion pieces and the site began relying more on opinion pieces to shore up their content. There was also a friendship bias – people got hired on to produce content as a result of their relationships with some of the other editors and columnists; all of this reinforced the bubble.</p></blockquote>
<p>This describes my understanding of the TV and print media landscape in the early 1990s. They weren&#8217;t explicitly trying to be &#8220;left-leaning&#8221;, but most of these institutions ended up with some degree of left-leaning bent because that&#8217;s just how most of the folks who worked there viewed the world. Editorial decisions get made, and people trying to be authentic manage to be authentic, and, even without a centralized desire to be left-of-center, the result is that &#8220;the media&#8221; leans left. </p>
<p>These were the conditions that birthed Fox News (which <i>did</i> have a specific goal to be right-of-center), allowing it to find a gap in the market because everyone else was <i>trying</i> to be &#8220;down the middle&#8221; but ending up a bit to the left. </p>
<p>Do people generally agree with the above? Folks on the left? The right? The biggest disagreements I can imagine are, &#8220;The media wasn&#8217;t biased before because the news profession didn&#8217;t lean as heavily &#8220;left&#8221; before everyone in a news room was required to have a BA or more&#8221; or &#8220;Of course those media outlets were pushing left-wing agendas! The notion that they tried to be impartial is absurd. They had power and they used it for their own political purposes.&#8221; (I&#8217;m more sympathetic to the first of those, but I&#8217;m not sure if they&#8217;re just strawmen I&#8217;ve concocted.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>In trying to answer your question, I&#8217;m first asking myself what the most consistent right- wing vs left wing values are, but I&#8217;m finding it difficult to answer that. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s often said the left is for change whereas the right wants to thwart change, but that doesn&#8217;t hold for the past half century, at least not literally. Trump was a candidate for change much more than Hillary. Reagan was for change. </p>
<p>Conservatism is like obscenity, you know it when you see it. Nixon was a conservative, but he was also a price- fixer. Gun rights was a left-wing position when it was the Black Panthers brandishing arms. I wanted to say democracy and a free media are inherently left-wing, but the Soviets weren&#8217;t right wing. Michael Savage, the most right-wing radio host of the aughts used to frequently say that John Kennedy was the last true conservative president. I never understood that, but the Qanon movement, which is clearly conservative, wants to believe Q is JFK Junior, so Savage wasn&#8217;t the only one who sees it like that. Free trade was considered conservative until recently. </p>
<p>I wanted to argue to myself that religion is inherently conservative, yet Trump isn&#8217;t religious nor is Mencius Moldbug.</p>
<p>The only eternal conservative issue I can think of is pro-family, whether that means nuclear family, extended family, clan, or race. Left- wingism seems consistently less pro-family. Plato was maybe the original left-winger. (Although I bet someone here  smarter than I can come up with someone before Plato.)</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve answered that, back to the media bias. </p>
<p>I place myself left of center, in case that disclosure matters. I think a free media in the US is going to be inherently on the left because the US is a melting pot of clans, races, etc. which makes it anti-family at the margin. I don&#8217;t mean the US is a melting pot in the &#8220;all agree the US should be a nation of immigrants &#8221; sense, what Steve Sailer calls &#8220;The Zeroth Amendment&#8221;.  I mean it as a matter of fact, a matter of history, whether you like it or not, we are a nation of immigrants, and a free media is going to play to its audience. I agree with the idea that the first priority of any institution is to defend its existence. An institution, after all, is something that is very good at replicating itself.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Left and Right change definition all the time. Lots of stuff that is considered Left or Right now would go somewhere else in the past. Some wasn&#8217;t really a thing to be considered in the past because technology just wasn&#8217;t there. </p>
<p>The way I see it, right now, &#8220;Left&#8221; believes that people&#8217;s needs should be met, unconditionally and free of charge. &#8220;Right&#8221; do not believe this can or should be done. The &#8220;Right&#8221; is immediately diverse &#8211; if you think people need to be worthy of nice things to get them you are right-wing, but there&#8217;s countless different ideas of what does it mean to be worthy &#8211; and different ideologies wear those ideas on their sleeves. The &#8220;Left&#8221; seems more uniform but also have a lot of division when they discover that people have conflicting needs &#8211; they fight over whose needs are more important.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Left&#8221; appeal seems to be both for people who have lots of resources or social standing and can take a hit of being forced to take care of others &#8211; or think they can swing public sympathies in their favour, and people who don&#8217;t have any hope of getting by on their own merit &#8211; that makes for somewhat weird demographic makeup of them.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>IMO, there <i>are</i> no grand underlying principles. Left and right are sort of like Scott&#8217;s description of the Sunnis and Shias: groups that are divided because they were divided, and the actual positions taken are just a matter of cultural affiliation, which is in turn a matter of historical accident and evolving circumstance.</p>
<p>Trying to come up with broad philosophical principles is a bit like looking at genes to figure out why one person has a broken arm and another a nose ring.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I have aknowledged it, and my post effectively described what I believe them to be right now. A belief that entitlement comes from need and that failing to fulfil this need (Or worse demanding concessions in exchange for fulfilling this need) is oppression &#8211; followed by fight over whose needs should take precedence and hate and ridicule of those who needs something from you vs belief that people should be able to control what is rightfully theirs &#8211; followed by equally vicious fighting over what is rightfully whose.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I look at the political landscape in two dimensions. One is an axis going from solidarity to egoism. The other is from centralism to libertarianism/individualism. Since we can&#8217;t organize society on everyone voluntarily showing solidarity, political ideas tend to align along a diagonal line from solidarity/centralism to egoism/freedom. That line is my definition of left to right in politics.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>For policy positions, yes.  but not the motives for those policy positions.  The basic leftwing impulse is leveling, tearing down corrupt hierarchies.  The basic right wing impulse is upholding virtuous ones.   For example, the draft is a leftwing policy when it&#8217;s about equal sharing of military burdens, it&#8217;s right wing when it&#8217;s about building up national strength.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>Conservatism is like obscenity, you know it when you see it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem is using local partisan parties as proxies for the underlying values.  Since Republicans are &#8220;conservative&#8221;, Americans tend to associate any standpoint embraced by Republicans as &#8220;conservative&#8221;, even when they want radical change.</p>
<p>More well-defined axes would be: conservative vs radical, liberal vs authoritarian, market economy vs planned economy, isolationist vs globalist, populist vs technocratic.  </p>
<p>These can perhaps be further deconstructed into (or correlated with) personal traits, like social vs individual, or loyal vs independent.</p>
<p>(There are correlations between these, of course.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>In the previous OT, I wrote about the Dutch government abusing their powers while going after childcare subsidy fraud.</p>
<p>In more recent news, reporters found evidence of substantial fraud with integration courses for foreigners. </p>
<p>The law is that people from outside the EU have to pass the NT2 exam (an exam for Dutch as the second language). The government provides €10.000 in subsidy to pay for courses. These courses used to be given by proper schools, but they were privatized to allow anyone to start such a school and collect the subsidy.</p>
<p>The scam is that the schools cooperate with the student to collect the subsidy, where the student gets a cut. No courses are given. This works because the requirement to pass the NT2 exam is waived if the student studied for 600 hours and failed the exam three times.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the reporters note that these (mostly Syrian) people come from a culture where trust is low and defrauding is seen as more acceptable. This may also be why in the childcare subsidy fraud case, the government committed ethnic profiling: the government noticing that non-natives defraud more.</p>
<p>Anyway, the seesaw to stricter policies is probably set in motion by this story, which will then result in (legal or illegal) strictness that will cause outrage stories about how hard it is to get subsidies, which will then cause the seesaw to go back up.</p>
<p>Perhaps one day the people involved will be able to wrap their heads around two things at once (easy access to those who get the subsidies for valid reasons and keeping fraud low).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s not intended to select who can stay, but to force people who are allowed to stay to integrate. If they were to start deporting people, it would undoubtedly result in the media campaigning against it by presenting the most sympathetic person who has to leave, which they have done repeatedly in the past.</p>
<p>Besides, some of these people will be refugees, so who is going to deport those back to the war zone?</p>
<p>Most of these people get welfare, so instead, they can sanction these people by reducing their welfare. However, they don&#8217;t want to punish a 60 year old illiterate woman who has only ever cooked &amp; cleaned for her family, so there is an &#8216;out&#8217; for people who can&#8217;t be taught.</p>

<p>I wonder how they came up with that flowchart, as opposed to putting them in a mental institution or something. I joke, and I guess maybe the exam is really hard or something. I suppose they just want people to put in an effort but don&#8217;t actually want to turn anyone away. Honestly, though, this is the kind of thing where I almost don&#8217;t feel that anyone who defrauded this program seems at fault. It&#8217;s like when you have an obvious vulnerability in an online platform, <i>of course</i> someone is going to exploit it, even if it&#8217;s not for material gain but just to prove they can; the results of the security vulnerability being exploited feel like they&#8217;re totally on those who created it, not those who exploited it. The government comes up with such a plan, and people will ask them to define &#8220;hour&#8221;, &#8220;course&#8221;, and &#8220;exam&#8221;, then exploit the hell out of whatever they can because they&#8217;ve essentially been told there are no stakes, therefore none of it matters.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p><i>I wonder how they came up with that flowchart, as opposed to putting them in a mental institution or something. </i></p>
<p>I would imagine the short answer is <a rel="nofollow"href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=207427&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=2104852" rel="nofollow ugc">court cases</a>.  Immigration lawyers and activists taking cases on behalf of C who has been in the country, can&#8217;t pass the <a rel="nofollow"href="https://nedles.nl/en/civic-integration-and-state-examination-nt2/" rel="nofollow ugc">language exam</a>, but is (held up as) working and contributing/being a special case of needing asylum or refuge, and it is Wicked And Evil of the government to try to deport them or refuse them entry or permission to stay.</p>
<p>It also looks like it has to do with &#8220;the implementation of the convention relating to the status of stateless persons across the EU&#8221;, especially if Syrians are the particular group mentioned here.</p>
<p>As to &#8220;private enterprise is not the solution to all problems&#8221;, yeah I&#8217;d expect that if you outsource a government programme so as to &#8220;let the free market solve this&#8221;, then you will get scammers and fraudsters whose first instinct is &#8220;free money!&#8221; rather than &#8220;by competing efficiently with other service providers, we will ensure a quality and economical provision of this desired end!&#8221;</p>
<p><i>the results of the security vulnerability being exploited feel like they’re totally on those who created it, not those who exploited it</i></p>
<p>I&#8217;m of the opposite opinion; if you&#8217;re looking for loopholes to enrich yourself at the expense of the rest of the community, you&#8217;re a thief and a robber and I have no reason to trust you or deal with you in any other way than as a wolfshead.  I certainly can&#8217;t live with you as a friend or colleague or other social relationshiop on terms of mutual assumption that you won&#8217;t try stealing my stuff, cheating me, or things like identity theft to empty out my bank account, because you&#8217;re proven you are that type of person.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think if the whole thing was pretty well monitored and there were ways that you could &#8220;do an hour&#8221; and for some reason that didn&#8217;t count towards your total (e.g. you spent that hour in a classroom but obviously playing phone games and someone is actually keeping track) then you would have a system like this that did what it was supposed to, but absent that, you have a vulnerable system. If you tell someone, &#8220;We want you to learn our language as a requirement for entering this country,&#8221; but then you give them this set of rules, then you&#8217;ve really only told them, &#8220;You have to waste 600 hours, then come in three times to freeform scribble on this piece of paper, then you&#8217;re in.&#8221; Why be anything other than results-oriented dealing with bureaucracy? Why put in effort to try and determine the spirit of the law?</p>
<p>To put it another way, let&#8217;s say there are two countries, A and B, which are equivalent other than A has this system, and B has some much stricter system (maybe you can stay, but citizenship and benefits depend on actually passing the exam). If someone in A complains that an unusually high proportion of the refugees they receive lack conscientiousness and are only trying to game the system, I&#8217;d think it was counter-productive to fixing their problem and they possibly haven&#8217;t understood their predicament very well. I appreciate that a more bottom up perspective is good for actually putting together communities that work and maybe we should shun those who try to abuse our systems (I think more likely we should just ignore those and use personal ethical codes to determine how we want to judge people in our communities), but immigration/citizenship stuff is necessarily going to be a bureaucratic system, and badly designed systems systematically give you bad results.</p>

<p>These courses used to be given by proper schools with credentialed teachers. I think that certain politicians &amp; bureaucrats wanted to cut the costs by privatizing it. These people seem to lack holistic thinking ability, where they consider multiple aspects, rather than just optimizing for one thing and then getting surprised when the major loophole they never considered gets exploited.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Reminds me of a similar scam in Thailand, where anyone could open up a school claiming to teach foreigners Thai and get them student visas. The foreigners pay the tuition and don&#8217;t bother showing up, so nobody has to teach. The government wised up when immigration officials noticed that people have been studying Thai for years but could only speak a few basic phrases.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s the flipside of that case mentioned in the previous Open Thread about the parents of the New Yorker writer, who were involved in visa fraud.</p>
<p>There they soaked the people who wanted to enter the country by pretending they could facilitate their immigration by getting them visas and jobs, and charged them an eye-watering fee for it.  The girl may want to think that her dad was unfairly treated just because he was trying to help out folks from the old country, but it was the same kind of money-making scam to exploit a loophole, just this time round they were exploiting the immigrants and not the government for money.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p><b>Who fixed the Dutch fixed expressions?</b></p>
<p>&#8216;Boter bij de vis&#8217; = Butter with the fish</p>
<p>Getting paid directly, rather than buying on credit. Refers to cooking a fish right away (by putting it in a pan with butter), rather than let it get old.</p>
<p>&#8216;Boterbriefje&#8217; = Butter letter (as in the piece of paper)</p>
<p>Marriage certificate. The original butter letter was an exemption to fasting, allowing someone to eat/drink milk products. This probably got applied to marriage, because it:<br />
&#8211; is permission by the authorities to do something that is otherwise forbidden (sex)<br />
&#8211; is something that people don&#8217;t necessarily believe that the authorities should have a say over</p>
<p>&#8216;Het botert niet (tussen hen)&#8217; = it doesn&#8217;t butter (between them)</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t get along. Originally meant more generally that something isn&#8217;t going well. Comes from farmers trying to churn butter.</p>
<p>&#8216;Bot vangen&#8217; = Catching bone</p>
<p>Failing at achieving your goal. Probably comes from rowing fishermen, where a rower who doesn&#8217;t lower his oar in the water, will skip over it and hit the oar of another rower. In old Dutch, &#8216;botten&#8217; was used for what is now &#8216;botsen&#8217; = colliding. In modern Dutch, &#8216;botten&#8217; = bones.</p>
<p>&#8216;Boven het hoofd hangen&#8217; = Hanging above the head</p>
<p>Something bad seems to happen soon. Probably comes from seeing dark clouds in the sky, not the fable of the Sword of Damocles.</p>
<p>&#8216;Boven water&#8217; = Above water</p>
<p>Out of trouble/no longer in debt. The equivalent of &#8216;keep one&#8217;s head above water&#8217; is also a Dutch saying.</p>
<p>&#8216;(Dat staat) als een paal boven water&#8217; = (That stands) like a pole above water</p>
<p>Without a doubt.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It seems almost impossible to determine what happened all those years ago.  I have no idea, and don&#8217;t see how anyone could come to an answer they have confidence in.  Same as with Kavenaugh.  And it was pretty obvious this would be the situation very early on.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>This was my read of the situation a few weeks ago. </p>
<p>But when I found out that Reade sat down and made a conscious pre-meditated decision &#8212; repeatedly &#8212; to lie on the stand for the prosecution to put people into jail, I moved her at least 50-50 into the &#8220;deliberate liar&#8221; category and would take 1:10 odds that Biden never inserted his fingers into her (assuming there was some Oracle that could fairly adjudicate the bet).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>When selling a car on Craigslist, if people email you through the anonymous relay asking you to email them at a gmail address which they include in their message, is this a red flag for a type of scam?

		<div class="comment-body"><p>When I bought my car, the guy I bought it from said I was the first legit buyer who contacted him (I texted the number he had listed). Everyone else was the classic &#8220;cashier&#8217;s check&#8221; scam, and he&#8217;d gotten like twenty or so in the first few days.</p>
<p>So big red flags I know about are: a) Wanting to pay with check; b) Not wanting to see the car before buying; c) anything else that&#8217;s too enthusiastic and isn&#8217;t what a reasonable adult acting in their own interests would do. If you or me were buying a car, we&#8217;d want to be sure it was good; if a scammer&#8217;s buying a car, he wants to get the deal done as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard for me to figure out whether the email thing is a red flag, because it sounds like a reasonable thing. People want to use their own emails. Do you have a cell number listed on the Craigslist ad? Probably a high proportion are scammers anyway, so it doesn&#8217;t hurt to be on your guard.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s a red flag for two reason. For once, it leads you away from Craigslist, so Craigslist support can not help you any more. And secondly, it makes you engage with them instead of them engaging with you, so you let your guard down and start buying into whatever situation they are creating, since nominally you are in control of the situation.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s not normal, really. If someone emails you through the craigslist relay, it goes to your email; if you reply to that email, it goes back to theirs. So there&#8217;s no reason to want it, and there&#8217;s no logical reason I can think of off the top of my head to come to the mistaken conclusion you want it.</p>
<p>With that being said, car sales are pretty easy to avoid being scammed on &#8211; you either accept cash or a cashiers check you personally watched them get at the bank. Fill out your bill of sale documents; disclose all damage in writing if your state has a fuck-the-seller lemon law set-up. So there&#8217;s no real reason not to engage people until it turns out to be a clear scam, so long as you are careful.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If it&#8217;s any kind of a template it&#8217;s a scam full-stop. </p>
<p>I tend to play the outside on that stuff because right now I have limitless time, I want to use theirs up for external utility(saving other people) and I like to be knowledgeable on fraud for different reasons, so it&#8217;s in my general benefit to run out the clock.</p>
<p>Since you are in a different situation and want to avoid the pain in the ass parts of it, I&#8217;d say there&#8217;s just no good reason to want to work outside of craigslist relay and you can ignore all of those without any probable loss.</p>

The site looked pretty much legit, but of course it wanted you to pay for the report by credit card, and when I checked the domain name it had been registered like a week prior to something sketchy sounding.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Which of them were Freemasons?  Early Masonry was (in its Continental form) very anti-Church (the Catholic version anyhow) and it being the time of Esoteric Wisdom From The East, there was a lot of quasi-occult/magical rituals and symbolism incorporated (which is why the Catholic Church is down on it).</p>
<p>Modern Freemasonry may be about charitable work and networking, but the early stuff was more &#8220;we know the secret history of the world&#8221;.  Heck, even our good materialist atheist friend H.G. Wells wrote a couple of tongue-in-cheek ghost stories where the narrator has studied the higher degrees of Masonry and Knows Occult-Type Stuff.  From &#8220;The Inexperienced Ghost&#8221;, where the person telling the story to the assembly is demonstrating how the ghost he swears he saw last night managed to do the trick of vanishing to the other side:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now, Sanderson is a Freemason, a member of the lodge of the Four Kings, which devotes itself so ably to the study and elucidation of all the mysteries of Masonry past and present, and among the students of this lodge Sanderson is by no means the least. He followed Clayton&#8217;s motions with a singular interest in his reddish eye. &#8220;That&#8217;s not bad,&#8221; he said, when it was done. &#8220;You really do, you know, put things together, Clayton, in a most amazing fashion. But there&#8217;s one little detail out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Clayton. &#8220;I believe I could tell you which.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; said Clayton, and did a queer little twist and writhing and thrust of the hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That, you know, was what he couldn&#8217;t get right,&#8221; said Clayton. &#8220;But how do you&#8211;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of this business, and particularly how you invented it, I don&#8217;t understand at all,&#8221; said Sanderson, &#8220;but just that phase—I do.&#8221; He reflected. &#8220;These happen to be a series of gestures—connected with a certain branch of esoteric Masonry. Probably you know. Or else—how?&#8221; He reflected still further. &#8220;I do not see I can do any harm in telling you just the proper twist. After all, if you know, you know; if you don&#8217;t, you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Last thread I asked about lawschool, and received cautions that I would be better off getting an MBA. Concurrently, my ultra-cynical boss advised me to get a masters in whatever-the-fuck from the most prestigious post secondary institution I could get into. Seeing as I picked lawschool because the LSAT seemed like fun and I had a series of good experiences with lawyers, I am open to the possibility that I should <a rel="nofollow"href="https://smile.amazon.com/Decisive-Make-Better-Choices-Life/dp/0307956393?sa-no-redirect=1" rel="nofollow ugc">widen my options</a> beyond lawschool/no lawschool. Meanwhile, my wife advises me to seek out a career counselor or admissions counselor whose practice has enough throughput that they would be able to contextualize my strengths and deficits sufficiently to make recommendations.</p>
<p>So, my question: does anyone have any experience with independent (as in not employed by your school) career counselors? Googling has so far turned up mostly therapists, who don&#8217;t look like they have the kind of throughput I&#8217;m looking for. </p>
<p>Alternatively, does anyone have any advice as to how I could get sufficient information to feel I am making a well informed decision?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It may be worth checking the total price in time/money against a few other non-grad options, including:</p>
<p>1. Staying the course, but having a less highly leveraged next couple years. If you are working extra hours to manage both work and school, or putting work on hold on the assumption schooling will be worth your full attention, and the economy changes in a big way&#8230; there is risk to committing all your slack to a set educational program, even for people who don&#8217;t have to borrow. For borrowers, the risk is higher.<br />
2. A direct-investment of the money for monetary return. E.g., buy bitcoin and land, or something.<br />
3. Combine a few smaller-cost educational/credential investments for a total boost &gt; the cost of the grad program you&#8217;re looking at. For a non-math smart person, one bundle worth looking at is to take the $200k you&#8217;d spend on a high-end MBA, and instead spend $15k (I think?) on a one-week training at the Harvard Negotiation Project, plus write a book and advance buy enough copies to ensure it&#8217;s a best-seller. (Which I think costs &gt;$100k, but less than $200k, but I looked into this last almost a decade ago.)</p>
<p>Theory: &#8220;Harvard-trained best-selling author ___&#8221; is, for people who weren&#8217;t after quants-related employment, &gt; &#8220;___, M.B.A. from not-Harvard.&#8221; For a mathy person, maybe a 6-month coding bootcamp, a 6-month linear algebra/data science training, and spending $1k on a very nice resume-website will have as good a return as a MBA. It&#8217;s very much not a decision I would recommend outsourcing. One other thing that is hard to achieve independently, but a direct investment (a la immersive bootcamp) can get big results: language immersion. If you can afford to keep your current job but spend a significant amount of time in an immersive foreign language environment, you can go from &#8220;knows the words&#8221; to &#8220;speaks fluently, non-native&#8221; potentially in a month or two.</p>

<p>Not if what you&#8217;re after is fluency to any level that would be useful in business.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the monetary returns on speaking a foreign language middlingly* are null, and even those for speaking it very well are small.</p>
<p>*I mean this as a subcategory of &#8220;fluently&#8221;. Everything that isn&#8217;t fluent is, for most purposes, equivalent to not speaking the language at all. Fluency is a really low bar.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It was time for the INF to go.</p>
<p>The INF banned land-based missiles with ranges between 500 and 5500km.  The treaty was intended to address concerns over the possibility of these weapons being used to conduct first-strike strategic nuclear attacks with far less warning than an ICBM or air attack (I don&#8217;t know why naval weapons were excluded, maybe because SSBNs are understood to be for second-strike).  It was a bilateral treaty between the US and the USSR because the area of concern was Europe.</p>
<p>The US has exploited its intermediate-range Tomahawk missile to the hilt, and while Russia has a <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3M-54_Kalibr" rel="nofollow ugc">similar weapon </a> limiting missiles like this to naval launch obviously favors the US somewhat since it has a stronger navy.  </p>
<p>I imagine this is rather annoying to the Russians, but I don&#8217;t think they made much of a fuss about it.  However, missiles have gotten more accurate in general since the treaty was signed in 1987.  This means it&#8217;s more feasible than in the past to field non-nuclear intermediate-range missiles.  A missile that previously required a nuclear warhead to destroy its target because it would only land somewhere in a 500m radius might not need one if it can now hit in a 50m (or even 5m) radius.  Russia seems to see these new, accurate intermediate-range missiles as a substitute for strike aviation, at least partially.  Previously you could assume that your intermediate-range missiles were either nuclear delivery systems or relatively ineffective (think Saddam&#8217;s Scuds); now that is no longer the case.  You could modify the treaty so that it only banned missiles carrying nuclear weapons, but it would be difficult to verify.  </p>
<p>So much for Russia.  What about the United States?  Well, the Chinese didn&#8217;t sign the INF (bilateral, remember).  And they&#8217;ve been freely developing their own intermediate range, land-based missiles like the DF-17 and DF-21.  While these have been around for a while, the US has shown increasing interest in countering these using their own land-based missiles.  For instance, the USMC recently released a rather interesting document stating that it saw its ability to forward-deploy land-based missiles as one of its major missions in the future.</p>
<p>So you have both sides of the treaty having a) pretty good reasons to build weapons banned by the treaty as a result of subsequent improvements in technology which b) don&#8217;t really pose much threat of nuclear escalation in Europe or anywhere else.</p>
<p>Russian testing of an extended-range Iskander missile was cited by the US as being the specific reason for withdrawing from the treaty, and it&#8217;s as good a reason as any, but like I said I think it was time for the treaty to go.  I also recall some grumbling from the Russian viewpoint that having an armed UAV take off and fly 2000km or whatever, release munitions, and (usually) fly back home isn&#8217;t really much different from a missile with the same range making a one-way trip, when you think about it.  That also would have been as good an excuse as any to withdraw from the INF in order to develop the missiles they wanted, but I&#8217;m sure they would rather have the Americans actually go through with tearing up the treaty to make themselves look marginally better.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I must have missed the last-OT version, sorry.  Taking yours and Lambert&#8217;s questions here:</p>
<p>Pulling out of the INF treaty was a pure loss for the United States.  The INF treaty did not restrict the United States from doing anything it would want to or even profitably could do in the post-Cold War era.  The INF treaty restricted only land-based intermediate range nuclear weapons, and there is no longer any land on which the US can usefully base intermediate-range missiles.  Germany, Britain, etc, are not going to allow us to base nuclear missiles on their soil to deter Soviet aggression.  In the Pacific, Japan is right out, South Korea probably so and only needs short-range (by treaty standards) missiles. and putting US nukes on Taiwan would basically start a nuclear war straight off.  There&#8217;s Guam, but it&#8217;s too small for useful dispersal; anything we base there goes bye-bye in a multi-megaton fireball at the outset of any nuclear war involving China.  American intermediate-range missiles are air- and sea-based, for good reason, and we can have as many of those as we want.</p>
<p>Yes, Russia was violating the INF treaty.  As long as the INF treaty was in place, that gave us the moral authority to say &#8220;Putin is the baddie for violating the INF treaty by building forbidden missiles&#8221;, which was diplomatically useful.  Now Putin is building the same missiles, but they&#8217;re not forbidden and he&#8217;s not violating any treaty and we look like the baddies for abrogating it.</p>
<p>START is probably going to be more of the same.  The only reason to ever build or deploy more nuclear weapons than allowed by START is if you want to squander trillions of dollars building useless and unnecessary weapons, or if you expect to wage the sort of all-out Global Thermonuclear War where &#8220;only&#8221; losing twenty million of your people counts as a <a rel="nofollow"href="https://youtu.be/EcK6ad_t9ak" rel="nofollow ugc">great victory</a>.  And there&#8217;s nobody else who is going to get into that sort of arms race if they can possibly avoid it (Russia can&#8217;t afford it, China doesn&#8217;t want it), so it&#8217;s entirely up to us.  START doesn&#8217;t stop us from doing anything we want to do, and it is a useful tripwire against some things we don&#8217;t want other people to do.</p>
<p>A renegotiation or replacement of START, possibly to include China and possibly to include new classes of weapons like intercontinental nuclear torpedoes, might be a minor improvement.  Going START-free so that we can build lots more missiles would be a stupid dangerous waste.  Going START-free in hopes that our potential adversaries will come begging us for a new treaty, isn&#8217;t going to work so long as Donald Trump is president.  So let&#8217;s not do that.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The INF restrict the intermediate land based non-nuclear missile systems that the army and marines wanted to develop, right?  I&#8217;m not claiming that the trade off was worth it, given  our superiority in sea launched systems, but I can see why the idea of repudiating the treaty was bubbling up and wasn&#8217;t pure Trump pique.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t think the Army&#8217;s desire for 500+ km missiles was ever really that strong, and even if it is &#8211; the Army works for us, not the other way around.  Deep strike isn&#8217;t a good match for anything else the Army does, and the heaviest launch platform they envision for the near future (the <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M270_Multiple_Launch_Rocket_System" rel="nofollow ugc">M270</a>) would be quite marginal for that mission.  Plus, again, the political problems of basing.</p>
<p>The desire of hypersonics nerds to build Mach umptysomething intermediate-range missiles for anyone who will give them the time of day is definitely real and sincere, but also not to be indulged for its own sake even if generals in green sometimes do give them the time of day.</p>

<p>The Air Force has been doing that a lot, too.  We&#8217;re actually getting some of them on aircraft these days, but those aren&#8217;t restricted by INF either.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Does anyone know of any start ups or labs working on synthetic milk and/or eggs? By which I mean genetically modifying something so that it produces lots of dairy/egg proteins and fats. Is it even feasible? Clean meat gets a lot of press, and seems reasonably inevitable, but has the problem of texture/scaffolding: an amorphous blob of cells is not quite meat. Milk and eggs seem to avoid that problem, although at the cost of it presumably being a lot harder to produce the proteins and fats at the required scale because they don&#8217;t just reproduce themselves like cells do.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I recently came across <a rel="nofollow"href="http://www.hrpub.org/download/20190830/EER1-14013392.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">this paper by Mark McMenamin</a> (of <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/hypersea-invasion" rel="nofollow ugc">hypersea</a> and Triassic kraken fame), where he advocates the creation of &#8216;hypertopias&#8217; as a solution to global heating. In a nutshell this involves the creation of new communities in marginal land areas (deserts, mostly) that are explicitly enjoined to hand-cultivate forests and other flora until such time as these become self-sustaining.  </p>
<p>I really like this idea. It&#8217;s heroic-with-a-small-h, it&#8217;s manageable, it ticks both liberal and conservative boxes the use of the environment, and it&#8217;s smart. Or so at least it seems to me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not an ecologist; is it a viable proposal?</p>

<p>Where does the money come from? Were it viable to irrigate the desert, people would already be doing it to grow crops. If we want to spend money on increasing the number of trees, we should be paying people not to slash and burn the rainforest.<br />
Where does the water come from? Do you end up burning more oil to run the desalinisation plants than you sequester? Yeah, there&#8217;s a bit of a forest microclimate but all that water comes from transpiration. </p>
<p>Yes, we should be geoengineering arid and semiarid areas to be more productive. We should be modifying crops to be more drought tolerant, to fix their own nitrogen and to use C4 fixation where appropriate. But the smart way is to grow crops and fodder on marginal ground to reduce the need for deforestation in other areas.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It needs an explanation of the part where any actual person would want to do this.  If McMenamin wants to recruit a bunch of his like-minded colleagues and go show us how it&#8217;s done, great.  Otherwise, it looks like the sort of thing where lots of people think it would be a great idea if <i>other</i> people went out and did this, but everyone looking at their own options will see locally-superior options and e.g. continue to farm their lands the way they always have in the community of the neighbors they have always trusted.  Or, if they can&#8217;t do that, become refugees and shoot for the &#8220;refugee working as a taxi driver in New York / Munich / Stockholm / wherever&#8221; path rather than the &#8220;refugee in someone&#8217;s newfangled ecotopian commune in the middle of nowhere&#8221; path.</p>

<p>Okay, and who are you going to get to work 12+ hour days in the heat hand-cultivating?  And who pays them? And what crops do they live on while they&#8217;re waiting for the trees to grow? And what is &#8220;self-sustaining&#8221; and who gets the benefit of it?  Because I can see this splitting off into &#8220;just above subsistence earnings peasants toiling in the manner of their great-grandparents until the project becomes viable, then it&#8217;s the guys in suits in the air-conditioned offices who take over to exploit it, and the peasants get packed off to where they came from&#8221;.</p>
<p>I am very cynical about Utopian ideas, and extra-cynical about ones that require somebody else to do the heaving and sweating.  Real-world desert farming projects like this are what Israel is <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.touristisrael.com/israels-desert-agriculture/10334/" rel="nofollow ugc">doing</a> &#8211; and this <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUNmN_bZNsk" rel="nofollow ugc">takes</a> a lot of technology, a lot of finance, and needs to produce a marketable product in the end.  An idealistic commune-type project is not going to cut it.</p>

<p>This project has a number of advantages:</p>
<p>1.  Creating more habitable land area in Egypt (one idea during the Eisenhower Administration was to donate the eventual new seaside land area to Palestinian Arabs for resettlement).<br />
2.  Improving the local climate.<br />
3.  Mitigating sea level rise somewhat (would probably counteract several years&#8217; worth of global sea level rise from climate change).<br />
4.  Generating hydroelectric power.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Couldn&#8217;t a section of the depression be closed off occasionally (perhaps with walled sections built ahead of time and gates), and the area allowed to dry out and the salt mined and exported?  Then the area of the depression could be hydrologically re-connected with the rest of the depression and allowed to fill back in, thus allowing the salt concentration of the rest of the depression to re-approach the salt concentration of the new ocean water coming in to fill that section of the depression back up (of course it wouldn&#8217;t ever get back to the original salt concentration of seawater, but it might help).  Of course, this area could be made off-limits to any settlement other than temporary settlement for the purposes of industrial extraction of the salt.  I don&#8217;t know how much time this would buy.  </p>
<p>Alternatively, I wonder if a smaller proportion of concentrated salty water could be continuously pumped back into the Mediterranean compared to the amount coming in, and whether that would allow the salt concentration to be stabilized at some level while also keeping the hydroelectric generation net-positive.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m interested to hear any thoughts people have in relation to this.</p>
<p>Personally, back in 2014, I ruminated about the &#8220;friendzone&#8221; a bunch, and paid attention to war between &#8220;the friendzone model tells you a lot about male/female relations&#8221; versus &#8220;the friendzone doesn&#8217;t exist and leads to a distorted view of people&#8221;. At the time I agreed with the second, but grew to think that a better model was somewhere in between.</p>
<p>The &#8220;fuckzone&#8221; to me seems precisely like the friendzone, in that there&#8217;s a person whom you get some intimacy from, and you want more, but they&#8217;re already <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM2yfrOu73w" rel="nofollow ugc">giving you everything</a> they want to give. This is interesting because under the traditional model that men want sex and women want commitment, it&#8217;s unsurprising that the fuckzone is what femcels complain about and the friendzone is what (male) incels complain about&#8230; although the men-sex/women-commitment model at best only tells you statistical averages! As a man, I have been both zoner and zonee for both fuck and friend.</p>

<p>Well, if you are a typical man, a friendzone &#8220;relationship&#8221; where you put in committment and resources but get no sex is arguably worse than nothing, because committment and resources are a cost and, to be honest, sex is the main thing you are after. At least, that&#8217;s my perspective as a man.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t know for sure how the typical woman thinks about it, but I guess that her view is pretty much symmetric: a &#8220;fuckzone&#8221; relationship can be very easily worse than nothing.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Can&#8217;t say if it&#8217;s the maleness of your mind or not, but this is very much not a universal sentiment.</p>
<p>Actually, OK, now I&#8217;m perplexed.  Wanting sex is a physical drive, correct?  And it&#8217;s one, even, that (a) can easily semi-satisfied by masturbation and (b) reportedly dies down after a couple of weeks if you don&#8217;t stoke it by constantly fantasizing and self-stimulating.   Whereas affiliation and secure relationship are psychological needs that are definitionally impossible to satisfy by yourself and that get worse over time.  How could it possibly seem like a worse problem to not have sex than to not be loved?<br />
 Some social animals will die in isolation; I&#8217;ve never heard of anyone dying of celibacy.</p>

<p>But the corresponding zone is not &#8220;not emotionally connnecting with their non-existent sex partners&#8221;, it is &#8220;friendzone versus fuckzone &#8211; in friendzone, you get the emotional connection of friendship but this does not translate into physical connection of sex&#8221; while &#8220;fuckzone &#8211; can get physical connection of sex but not emotional connection of romance&#8221;.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s frustrating to be &#8220;No Horace, I can only be a sister to you&#8221; (see <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1xrvtn" rel="nofollow ugc">linked cartoon</a>) then it&#8217;s equally frustrating to be &#8220;I can only think of you as somewhere to dump my seed when I&#8217;m horny&#8221;.  One-night stands are probably frustrating for both parties but better than nothing if that&#8217;s all they can get; a guy who only wants to have access to your bits but nothing more and will stick around as long as he gets the free milk without having to buy the cow is just as frustrating for women as &#8220;she likes having me around to cry on my shoulder about other guys but won&#8217;t take the step to the next level&#8221; for guys.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>That assumes that the women being fuckzoned want sex.</p>
<p>I know women who enjoy sex on its own; they get sex with the guys of their choosing, and never need to beg, because they know they can find a guy willing to have sex with them in a couple of minutes on Tinder.</p>
<p>So the women getting fuckzoned are like the men who pay for the movies and restaurant meals for the girls who are friendzoning them. Do they enjoy it on its own? Sure, it would have been enjoyable if it was part of a relationship. But on its own, without the relationship, it&#8217;s not that enjoyable.</p>
<p>There was a conversation about demisexuality in a previous thread; the consensus seemed to be, that&#8217;s how a lot of heterosexual women work.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think those emotional connections are so comparable.  I don&#8217;t mean to downplay the importance of platonic friendships, but the emotional bonds you (or at least I) form with lovers are very different.</p>
<p>@ana53294 </p>
<blockquote><p>&gt;That assumes that the women being fuckzoned want sex.</p></blockquote>
<p>They don&#8217;t want only sex, but how many of us that aren&#8217;t 14 do?</p>
<blockquote><p> But on its own, without the relationship, it’s not that enjoyable.</p></blockquote>
<p>Less enjoyable, perhaps.   Not entirely unejoyable.  And presumably more enjoyable than the lonely misery of &#8220;no one will ever want to fuck me.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Key word: <i>semi</i>-satisfied.  If your right hand worked as well as a woman, nobody would ever bother with paying prostitutes.  Even with the prostitute, I imagine there&#8217;s a fair amount of dissatisfaction due to the obvious artificiality of the situation; the feeling that a woman chose to be yours is something quite distinct from deep, long-term emotional commitment.</p>

<p>No, but your genes will die with you, which from an evolutionary point of view, makes you as good as dead.</p>
<p>Women have a nearly symmetric problem, or at least used to have it in the enviornment of evolutionary adaptation: before the age of paternity tests, mandatory child support, comfy office jobs and daycare, it was very hard for a woman to raise a child without the resources provided by a man, hence the focus on partner commitment. On a first-order approximation, men extract resources from the environment (or seize them from other people) and women turn resources into the next generation of the tribe.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s unclear that the evolutionary point of view is remotely appropriate for this discussion; someone who is in a loving, satisfying, sexual relationship but is infertile is clearly in a much better position than someone stuck in either the friendzone or fuckzone by pretty much any standard you could imagine that is relevant to the above discussion, and yet from the evolutionary perspective the person I hypothesize above is equivalent to them.</p>

<p>Yes, because our preferences didn&#8217;t evolve to directly maximize evolutionary fitness (which is hard to estimate and can be accurately measured only a posteriori), rather they maximize things that were proxies of evolutionary fitness in the EEA.</p>
<p>Sex with anything that looks like a fertile woman is a proxy for evolutionary fitness if you are a man, it&#8217;s rather easy to figure out whether you are getting it or not, so that what our preferences evolved to maximize. Similarly, women try to maximize a combination of sex with high genetic quality men and commitment from high resource men (who may or may not be the same person).</p>

<p>and incels&#8217; unhappiness is a result of frustrating the natural evolutionary drive to copulate with many partners, then we would expect that to be somewhat solvable by media-enriched masturbation, and fully solvable by the use of multiple prostitutes.  Lizard-brain circuits are dumb and operate at a pretty basic level. Once somebody goes on to argue that no, prostitution or masturbation with visuals are not the same, because you need [specific social context], that&#8217;s clearly leaving the realm of fundamental survival drives and weaving in some other complex social or psychological needs.  </p>
<p> If I crave sugar because of evolved, survival-oriented reward circuits, I can generally address that by going out and purchasing a cake to eat.  Once I go on to say that no, I have a natural Darwinian desire for sugar, BUT therefore what I really need is for a member of this specific group of people to bake me a specific kind of cake for free, of their own accord, while I stand here and whine&#8230; well, I feel like at that point it&#8217;s not just about the sugar anymore.</p>

<p>Well, it&#8217;s the best theory that we&#8217;ve got.</p>
<blockquote><p>and incels’ unhappiness is a result of frustrating the natural evolutionary drive to copulate with many partners, then we would expect that to be somewhat solvable by media-enriched masturbation, and fully solvable by the use of multiple prostitutes. Lizard-brain circuits are dumb and operate at a pretty basic level. </p></blockquote>
<p>Masturbation and prostitution have existed for a long time and they are not very successful reproductive strategies. Masturbation results in no children, and while in principle you could impregnate a prostitute before reliable birth control was a thing, they usually aborted or abandoned their children.<br />
Men who completely satisfied their sexual urges with masturbation or prostitutes instead of pursuing women who were likely to raise their children had their genes selected against.</p>
<p>Masturbation in men probably serves the main purpose of flushing the genital organs in order to prevent pressure build up and accumulation of dead sperm cells, which can cause pain and eventual infertility (this is the reason why vasectomies can cause chronic pain and eventually become irreversible, and vasectomies only block the testicles but leave the prostate and seminal vesicles, which produce most of the volume of the sperm fluid, free to drain). Thus masturbation is only evolutionary beneficial to the extent that it preserves genital health for sex at a later time. If you are never going to have sex, you could well let your balls burst, as far as evolution is concerned.</p>
<p>Prostitution can provide marginal evolutionary fitness on its own, but less than mating with a stable partner (not necesarily your own stable partner, as impregnating the wife of another man is also evolutionary successful).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s different for different people, mostly correlating with gender. And you can&#8217;t do intersubjective utility comparison (sorry utilitarians).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>the subreddit is a dumpster fire, but a very quick read of it doesn&#8217;t seem to reveal a lot of people claiming that their issue is that no o one wants to spend time with them, but that they are having trouble getting relationships that are both sexually and emotionally satisfying.

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>You’re missing the part where not having friends is a real problem and it doesn’t go away just because someone sticks a penis inside you. If we’re comparing a “friendzone” with a “fuckzone”, the people in the friendzone by definition have friends.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think having friends or getting laid or not is the problem, but that the relationships you are in are unbalanced &#8211; or worse, exploitative.  You get to hang out with your dream girl, but she only hangs out with you as long as you fix her car or helps her with her homework.  There isn&#8217;t any romantic commitment in the friendzone either, as I understand the term.   &#8220;I love you, and let&#8217;s be together but wait with sex until we&#8217;re married&#8221; is not the friendzone.</p>
<p>One thing I think is highly unproductive for both incel and femcel, is the vitriolic lack of respect for the other sex.  How can you expect to get the relationship you want with a member of the other sex when your baseline is that they are all worthless, evil people?  A community of this just becomes a tarpit of self-pity, where you get (almost) all the social reinforcement you need from collectively hating the outgroup.</p>
<p>And consequently, the solution is advice on how to trick somebody into giving you what you want.  Admittedly, I didn&#8217;t read much of the reddit, but &#8211; how can you even think this is a way of starting a romantic relationship?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You can hire a prostitute. And sometimes that even solves the problem!</p>
<p>But usually what people &#8220;unable to have sex&#8221; mean is &#8220;unable to get the social validation of a person wanting to voluntarily have sex with me.&#8221; For a femcel, it would be &#8220;unable to get the social validation of a man wanting to be in a relationship with me.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m not so sure about that. Let&#8217;s imagine a couple of guys who have trouble with platonic friendships.</p>
<p>Adam has always had trouble making friends and doesn&#8217;t have any friends now. He spends all his time alone and miserable and he&#8217;s not sure if things will ever get better.</p>
<p>Bob has &#8220;friends&#8221; but none of his so-called friends really value him very much. They hang out with him only when they don&#8217;t have a better option, or they call him up under pretext of friendship when what they really want is some kind of favor. Bob lives in a state of partly successful denial about this. Sometimes he&#8217;s able to convince himself that his &#8220;friends&#8221; are real friends, and other times the delusion is pierced and he&#8217;s left feeling sickened, ashamed, and used.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent time as both, and as miserable as it is to be Adam, I think it&#8217;s better than being Bob. I imagine getting fuckzoned is something like being Bob.</p>

<p>Again, &#8220;can only get casual sex&#8221; seems, by definition, less of a problem than &#8220;can&#8217;t get any sex that isn&#8217;t paid for&#8221;.  Not a small problem by any means, but less of one.   especially if we&#8217;re assuming that, for both incels and femcels, they do have some emotionally satisfying non-sexual relationships.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Probably because the incels aren&#8217;t willing to settle. They expect to be cheated on by women who merely settle for them. They expect women who reluctantly accept them as husbands will prefer to (and be able to) get pregnant by more desirable men. If you settle, you settle for cuckoldry, at least where the incels are concerned.</p>

<p>In most cases if that&#8217;s not happening, it&#8217;s just a case where the standards are higher than the available capital.

		<div class="comment-body"><p>No, not that. Think of it this way:</p>
<p>Good looking people tend to end up with other good looking people. If they don&#8217;t, there&#8217;s usually some other factor that makes it make sense &#8211; maybe the uglier partner is really funny, very successful or very good at guitar. This isn&#8217;t absolutely true in 100% of cases, but it implies a rule of thumb I think is valid: people will generally try to secure the highest-value person they can for their significant other. Their definition of value might be looks or piousness or loyalty &#8211; it&#8217;s not all shallow, but a lot of it is.</p>
<p>Since both parties are looking for high value, that means the value any person can secure is correlated to what they themselves are and can offer. This is what I referred to as &#8220;capital&#8221;; it&#8217;s what they have to get with. </p>
<p>A person with low capital can virtually always secure a significant other(at least in a large enough population center). But to do that, they have to drop their expectations of what they can get to match what they can give. </p>
<p>If you goal is &#8220;have a romantic partner&#8221; and you will accept faults sufficient to find a person who will accept yours, it&#8217;s no huge impossible thing. This is what everyone who is with anybody has already done.</p>
<p>Some people choose not to do this, because the people they can get don&#8217;t seem to them to be worth having. I don&#8217;t think this in and of itself is a bad choice. Any time someone says they are &#8220;waiting for the right person&#8221;, this is essentially what they are talking about.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>There’s nothing wrong with this</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, there&#8217;s some people&#8211;or anyway, I can picture hypothetical people, not thinking of anyone in particular&#8211;who aren&#8217;t good for anyone, even other people who aren&#8217;t good for anyone, in an &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t join any club that would have me for a member&#8221; kind of way. </p>
<p>But that&#8217;s probably rare, and a lot of people&#8217;s standards are probably way higher than is useful for them due to media, social or otherwise. We&#8217;re constantly surrounded by representations of people at their best, often the best people. Carefully groomed and sculpted actors playing heroes and heroines, for instance. While it might be helpful aspirationally, it surely skews our perception of what an average person is like.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m a little skewed because I was in this situation &#8211; for a long time(from the young-me perspective) what I could consistently date were people I wasn&#8217;t attracted to for physical and non-physical reasons. </p>
<p>I concluded then that I should probably hold out for someone I particularly liked, especially considering that I wanted to get married and it would be sort of terrible to trick somebody into a &#8220;well, I don&#8217;t like you much but I&#8217;m sort of terrified of being alone&#8221; reasons.</p>
<p>This worked out for me and I found someone who vastly over-values my few strong points who is overall much better than me in most ways. </p>
<p>I do agree with you though &#8211; there has to be a bad version of this where there&#8217;s an unimpressive person who won&#8217;t settle for anything under demigod. I&#8217;m not sure how you fix that, though.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t know about the standards thing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly true that media has a very high standard for beauty in general, but it&#8217;s also true that a real person of the preferred sex in real life, can be a lot more sexy than a model on a screen, even if the real person would never be accepted on the set of a tv show. </p>
<p>I mean, obviously the friendzoned people must be not only asking out TV-level girls, simply because they aren&#8217;t that common. I assume the &#8220;real girls aren&#8217;t as pretty as the girls on screens so what&#8217;s the point&#8221; people are a very small minority.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think both incels and femcels could be seen as being part of a &#8220;mutual misery society&#8221;, possibly as a result of learned helplessness. Its a lot easier to commiserate with others that the world is biased against you, than it it to recognize that things may be tough but that you can get better with effort.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not familiar with femcels, but in my observation of incels, they seem somewhat obsessed with genetic reasons for their hopelessness. Hence, the focus on height that seems to keep coming up in their discussions. Similarly, &#8220;wristcells&#8221; seem to believe that their wrists are genetically too narrow for them to be attractive.</p>
<p>In a twisted way, I don&#8217;t think that they want to date, since that would prove their worldview to be a lie.</p>

<p>Woman here, just want to note that I have never to my knowledge even noticed a man&#8217;s wrists (although slender hands on a man are very elegant and sexy, and would presumably correlate with slender wrists).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think for a lot of people describing themselves that way, their problems really aren&#8217;t just external factors/what it says on the tin. They have issues with themselves and the way they view relationships/sex, both what they want and what they think other people have. I&#8217;ve heard stories of incels having a casual hookup and then continuing to identify as incels because &#8220;it didn&#8217;t count&#8221; for one reason or another. If that can happen, clearly it&#8217;s not a problem with a simple, straightforward solution.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>The “fuckzone” to me seems precisely like the friendzone, in that there’s a person whom you get some intimacy from, and you want more, but they’re already giving you everything they want to give.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, the general model is that in a relationship men trade committment for sex and women trade sex for committment. So the suckers at this game are men who give away commitment without getting any sex (friendzone) and women who give away sex without getting any committment (fuckzone).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>There&#8217;s certain line of thought that the latter is an instance of the Prisoner&#8217;s Dilemma: Women used to be able to insist on commitment because they mostly all did, because pregnancy without a partner was Very Bad, but then widespread birth control and female employment reduced both the probability and the penalty of that outcome. So some women could defect, which pushed more to defect, and here we are.</p>
<p>Is there a symmetric analysis of the &#8220;friendzone&#8221;? It&#8217;s probably fair to say that once upon a time most men could and did insist on sex as part of a commitment. Are men defecting from that?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>The question is why men are suddenly willing to commit without getting sex.</p></blockquote>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t the friendzone concept kind of imply they thought they would get sex out of it? I don&#8217;t think it is sudden. Demonstrating commitment requires an upfront investment of resources of some kind in the hope it would pay off in sex. Plus, people are generally social, and some are willing to get pretty invested in others just to have something to  do or feel good about themselves. It also sounds less noble to demand sex than it does to demand commitment, in general, so most people find it more awkward. Also, even though historically wives were generally expected to be regularly intimate with their husbands,  demanding sex in the era before contraception could threaten a woman&#8217;s health. There has always been some level of ethical discomfort surrounding the demand for sex.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m going to question the premise that the past was so very different here. Othello, for example, gives us an incel (Roderigo), a femcel (Bianca) who is in Cassio&#8217;s fuckzone, and a man (Cassio) who is no mere unsuccessful suitor but instead in love with a woman (Desdemona) who he makes no open attempt to woo but whose troubles he hears sympathetically and whose existence is probably the reason he rejects the option of a serious relationship with Bianca &#8211; prototypical friendzone.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My working model of the incel scene is that in our atomized world, sex for men and romantic relationships for women are both proxies for status and social approval.   I actually kind of wonder whether male incels would actually enjoy sex that much, or female incels a dating relationship&#8211; except that for both populations, getting that thing is what&#8217;s needed to convince them they&#8217;re not a repulsive omega in the pecking order.  </p>
<p>Perversely, that positional/competitive dynamic should in theory cause each gender&#8217;s desires to converge on the thing that is <i>hardest to get</i> from the opposite gender, independently of whether it&#8217;s actually enjoyable in itself.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>My intuition is that you are wrong, that social status/approval are ways of getting relationships/sex, and so if we consider the arrow in the opposite direction you are at best only slightly right. The Pope and Barack Obama have a lot of status but there are people who have much more status than them. And if someone told me they were dating someone else that I respect a lot, my respect for *them* would go up only slightly.</p>
<p>I think sex and relationships are extremely fun and an end unto themselves. There are other animals that do pair-bonding, and promiscuity, they are objectively good reproductive strategies. They do not do it that do not care at all about social status.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m willing to be persuaded though&#8230;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s about status. Well, at least for the incels. The femcels&#8230;harder to say. Likely still, I think. </p>
<p>There is a LOT of social stigma around being a male virgin. Around being unattractive. Around not being able to find an attractive woman to have sex with you and tell you you&#8217;re valuable to someone/society/the world. </p>
<p>Look at what the incels go for &#8211; it&#8217;s not &#8220;no one at all will have sex with me&#8221; (though there&#8217;s a component of that. It&#8217;s &#8220;the attractive women don&#8217;t have sex with me.&#8221; That&#8217;s a status complaint. They don&#8217;t want sexual release. They want a partner (or series of partners) who they consider valuable (ditto the femcels). </p>
<p>Especially it&#8217;s a status thing because of the social stigma surrounding being a male virgin, or being unable to find a relationship. Lone men are stigmatized and told there&#8217;s something wrong with them (as are lone women).  Lone men who have a lot of sex are still validated, mind you. </p>
<p>It is toxic to the self-esteem to feel unloveable and unattractive. But it&#8217;s a status issue &#8211; it&#8217;s not that you can&#8217;t get sexual release. It&#8217;s that the group rejects you. It&#8217;s like complaining people you don&#8217;t like don&#8217;t invite you to parties &#8211; on one level, it&#8217;s irrational. On another level, it still hurts not to be included in things, because humans want to be part of the group.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not necessarily a status complaint. People don&#8217;t only prefer attractive partners for status. Many people would find a partner below some level of attractiveness worse than nothing, in terms of personal enjoyment, not only status.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The incel obsession with hierarchical ranking of both men and women does suggest that at least part of the issue is status. Also, the fact that there are incel <i>groups </i>at all, and that they have a name for themselves, and their own distinctive terminologies and shared beliefs&#8211;it&#8217;s the construction of a community for people who feel themselves excluded from the broader society. If it were just about the sex, forming a community of other un-sexed men would be kind of a pointless response to the predicament. If it&#8217;s about social stigma, forming a community is exactly what you would expect.</p>
<p>(And yes, probably ditto for the femcels.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Animals are completely about social status and dominance hierarchies, though. And dominance hierarchies dictate who has access to sexual partners. </p>
<p>Even in non-social animals there is e.g. territory, which you cannot keep if you&#8217;re a pushover. I expect a territorial animal that can&#8217;t defend its territory to have poor sexual prospects, but maybe I&#8217;m projecting from social animals too much.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m inclined to agree with you Zephalinda because your problematization matches my personal experience; I was much more motivated by the esteem and acceptance indicated or caused by sexual activity than I was sex itself. That being said, I&#8217;m not sure how generalizable that is. I&#8217;ve spoken with other human beings, and by and large they seem to like sex a <i>lot</i>. Those for whom it is a compulsion without a pedestal seem to be the minority rather than the herd.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think being a male virgin, or being the girl who never had a boyfriend, is highly stigmatized.  Being single but with a couple of relationships or at least sexual experiences behind you, less so.  Many divorced people of both sexes will claim to be better off without a spouse.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I stand by the stance I had a while back: these are real phenomena but not something that everyone experiences. They&#8217;re also being gendered in a way that, while typical, is not the universal experience. The lack of discussion about this is pointing to a dysfunction in gender relations/dating culture, one that doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to be solved by going back to ye olden times but which does require serious thought and solutions. One at which both genders and many subcultures have a seat at the table.</p>
<p>Anyway, friendzoning happens when you have a more attractive personality/social qualities than body/sexual qualities. Fuckzoning happens in the reverse. And they both happen to men and women, but the general nature of society (particularly among young people) is that women are more likely to be in the second situation and men in the first. (PS: Keep in mind, this says nothing about their absolute qualities: a woman can be extremely attractive and have a very good personality but that gap will still create men willing to have sex with her but not date her. Likewise, a man can have an okay personality but be ugly as sin, which will still mean there are women willing to be his friend but not date him.)</p>
<p>The solution is really simple: You need to increase whichever attribute you&#8217;re deficient in. Ideally both. If you&#8217;re getting friendzoned, get in shape, dress better, learn to be more charming. (All of these are learned skills.) If you&#8217;re getting fuckzoned, work on being a better partner, more interesting to spend time with, more capable of sustaining the non-sex parts of a relationship. You don&#8217;t need to give up anything about yourself unless you define your personality by being out of shape or boring at conversation. You can be a handsome, charming Star Wars nerd or a beautiful, attentive woman who likes to do MMA without issues.</p>
<p>And frankly, this sort of thing will prepare you for the real world. It&#8217;s very, very common socially to have to navigate relationships where you&#8217;re trying to feel out what the other person wants. Setting boundaries and making compromises and all that is important in everything from romantic relationships to business deals to international treaties.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>As a male, I think the problem is that all directions in which the culture pushes you are extremely unhealthy.  The correct route to self-improvement you mentioned is pretty much hidden. The recommended options are either a narcissist macho breathing toxic masculinity or a pushover &#8220;feminist ally&#8221; nu-male with no opinions of their own, depending on who you ask. Some people just opt out and become socially oblivious nerds.</p>
<p>If you are a young boy in the 21st century, nobody will show you how to be confident without being an asshole. I wasted a good part of my 20s bouncing between &#8220;redpill&#8221; angry misogyny and confused, empathic supplication. Despite many problems with traditional cultures, I think they at least attempt to teach this to each generation &#8211; as a man you are expected to be a pillar of your community, neither a doormat nor a selfish parasite. This memetic current is pretty much dead now.</p>
<p>I wonder how the female perspective looks like. I think the current cultural emphasis on sex and body image is doing nobody any favors, and makes the femcel self-esteem problems a lot worse.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yeah, I look back at my youth and I see how a lack of role models to demonstrate upstanding ways to successfully navigate social situations in an upstanding manner really lead to a lot of unnecessary hardship for myself and those around me&#8211;not to mention academic carnage unfortunately. Luckily I was fundamentally disposed to treat people nicely, but if someone had taken me under their wing and been kind to me subject to my donning a toxic ideology? I could have become awful.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Something my father once told me: &#8220;Your success in life is going to rely on your ability to understand what&#8217;s really going on when people are trying to make sure you don&#8217;t.&#8221; One of the better pieces of advice I&#8217;ve been given.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found even when you find something out and tell people they&#8217;ll often not believe you. I can pretty definitively tell you I&#8217;ve figured out how to get in a relationship or make more money because I&#8217;ve both done it myself and helped dozens of other people do it, male and female. Most people still don&#8217;t listen to my advice on those topics. Which makes sense, since I&#8217;m one of many competing voices and not a particularly shout-y one.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think the conservative answer (&#8220;Here is a script, read from it.&#8221;) works better than what liberals currently have (&#8220;Write your own script! No rules except for the ones we made up yesterday!&#8221;). I think more liberal rules could work but I&#8217;d frame them as something like choices with consequences. A man who spends all day in his basement or a woman who never puts on makeup is making a choice, a completely valid choice, but they also don&#8217;t get to complain about the choices other people make. Like not dating them. And so they should be encouraged to price that into their choices.</p>
<blockquote><p>I wonder how the female perspective looks like. I think the current cultural emphasis on sex and body image is doing nobody any favors, and makes the femcel self-esteem problems a lot worse.</p></blockquote>
<p>My understanding is that they feel a lot of pressure to somehow simultaneously conform to a set of extremely progressive values, traditional realities, and pursue their own desires.</p>
<p>For example, the feminist insistence that women matter more than their looks combined with the fact that (in terms of social prestige and attention) focusing on their looks gives a young woman the biggest ROI. This combines with the &#8220;have-it-all&#8221; mentality of not talking about downsides to create a false but uncomplicated message. Rather than hearing, &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to look good if you don&#8217;t want to. Men won&#8217;t pay as much attention to you, but you can choose whether you care about that.&#8221; They hear, &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to look good if you don&#8217;t want to. Do what you want!&#8221; And then they get pissed at &#8220;Staceys&#8221; when men go for more conventionally attractive women. Some of them respond by constructing elaborate coping mechanisms that delegitimize male choice, just as some men do for women.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>There&#8217;s an analogous situation for men (I know this has been beaten to death) where we are told that it is what is inside that counts, that superficial things like money and cars and clothes don&#8217;t matter to worthwhile women, just be yourself. Most men naturally ignore that but if you take it to heart you end up wondering why the rewards go to men that play that game. Then you start getting resentful of successful men and the women that date them because they don&#8217;t behave the way they are &#8216;supposed&#8217; to.</p>
<p>What is really going on is that women want a guy that they can be proud to show off to their friends and family. Framed that way there is nothing untoward or devious about women&#8217;s behavior: it is completely relatable. And yet a lot of people try and make sure you don&#8217;t understand that. Maybe because they think the world would be better if people cared less about status, or maybe because they feel you are a competitor and they want to discourage you from gaining status.</p>
<p>Is that close?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think part of the problem is that post-Sexual Revolution, the ideal presented is &#8220;have lots of fun sowing your wild oats while you&#8217;re young &#8211; teens to twenties &#8211; then settle down into a long-term relationship/marriage in your thirties&#8221;.</p>
<p>For young men to have a constant stream of fun, sexy partners for the &#8220;sowing wild oats&#8221; requires that there is a population of young women who also have bought into the &#8220;sowing wild oats&#8221; model, that they won&#8217;t nag you into a relationship or committment or expect anything more than no strings attached mutual enjoyment.</p>
<p>But if you persuade women &#8211; with the advent of the Pill, feminism, women entering the workforce and all the rest of it &#8211; to adopt the male model of sexuality, then they&#8217;re going to adopt male attitudes.  And we&#8217;re seeing the fruits of that now &#8211; the pressure to be sexual/romantic at earlier and earlier ages (seriously, what the fuck &#8211; pardon the language &#8211; is up with the notion of thirteen and fourteen year olds dating/having boy and girlfriends?) so that the bar gets constantly lowered about &#8220;if you&#8217;re not doing X by age Y then you&#8217;re a failure and a loser&#8221;, the expectation of moving on to a series of conquests and then being able to find a spouse and transition to that level of adulthood with creating a family, except that now it&#8217;s getting pushed to later and later because of the &#8216;two-income trap&#8217;, the necessity for woman as well as men to work on their career so fertility is pushed to later and later (<a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/news/2019/19/average-age-of-first-time-mothers-up-to-29-9-years" rel="nofollow ugc">average age</a> of first time mothers in the USA is thirty, so that means that while some women are having children at a much earlier age, some women are having children at a much greater age), and everyone thinks everyone else is having the ideal life of fun and then committment.</p>
<p>And when women, in the name of empowerment and a range of other reasons (remember, early in the Sexual Revolution it was to the benefit of men to get women to break the expectation between committment and sex), start behaving like men &#8211; demanding a certain level of physical attractiveness in potential sexual partners, engaging in short-term encounters, being picky about when and with whom they will settle down &#8211; then men don&#8217;t like it either being on the receiving end of &#8220;good enough to fuck but not marriage material&#8221;, much less &#8220;not even good enough to fuck&#8221;.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m a 30-year-old woman, and I basically agree with this, and with Deiseach said below. Erusian also makes some good points. Young people now don&#8217;t have functional social templates for these things, and both sexes struggle in different ways. Most people can&#8217;t easily figure this stuff out entirely on their own, and the culture has gone beyond allowing more options to making it actively hostile to figure out working arrangements. There were a lot of issues with older systems, issues that IMO made the sexual revolution inevitable, not something we just roll back. (In The Closing of the American Mind, Bloom talks about how the sexual revolution caused major dysfunction among young people, but instead of counseling a return to tradition, he kind of leaves it hanging. Like he admits that what happened kind of appeared as the only rational, decent response to many at the time, but that it seems unsustainable, so something will have to give.) And if we could roll it back, that doesn&#8217;t mean we should. But the status quo is increasingly dysfunctional (trends that have been around a while accelerated rapidly and combined with other trends) and this will become more evident. There is no perfect system, but we need change. </p>
<p>There are a lot of ways to go about that if we can accept change is needed. People&#8217;s expectations are too high, but in many ways this is because those expectations are fundamentally contradictory&#8211;it is more complicated than people just got more shallow or entitled or whatever. It&#8217;s more about the &#8220;having it all&#8221; aspect that permeates a lot of areas of modern life, and that has caused a lot of unsustainable trends.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I had those exact thoughts when I was in college. I didn&#8217;t even want sex or a relationship at the time, just proof that I wasn&#8217;t completely worthless. Because when you&#8217;ve been told that EVERY girl experiences that kind of harassment, regardless of how attractive she is, it can get warped into a bizarre self-loathing for those who haven&#8217;t experienced it.</p>
<p>When I finally got catcalled it was frightening but also kind of a relief. (That happened on the same night when I discovered why my doctor warned me to stay away from alcohol. It was an unpleasant but very eye-opening night.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>What I find interesting is that she wouldn&#8217;t like to be hit on, stared at or sexually propositioned even though it never happens to her, and even though she would like to feel attractive. I&#8217;ve long assumed that women who are annoyed by these things are annoyed because it happens all the time, while people to whom these things rarely or never happen (i.e. most men and some women) would either enjoy them or at least wouldn&#8217;t mind them.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I never even got propositioned all that often when I was younger but in 80% of the cases they&#8217;d blow right past my &#8216;no thank you &#8211;&gt; actually, I&#8217;m busy, so no &#8211;&gt; I really have to go now &#8211;&gt; no, I don&#8217;t want your phone number for later &#8211;&gt; I have a boyfriend (&#8216;I won&#8217;t tell him if you won&#8217;t, wink wink&#8217;) &#8211;&gt; look, really NO&#8217;. The other 20% were just the people awkwardly fumbling towards connection, and that was generally fine if not necessarily a high point in my day. </p>
<p>If that&#8217;s what people think of when thinking &#8216;hit on, stared at or sexually propositioned&#8217; (instead of &#8216;flirted with&#8217;, which can be thoroughly enjoyable), there&#8217;s really no upside. It&#8217;s not like you&#8217;d expect the average femcel to have the social skills to send those boys off skedaddling with a wink and a saunter, so the experience ranges from intrusive to actively scary. (&#8216;OK, I said &#8216;no&#8217; 4 times, which he doubled down on. He looks to be about 50 pounds heavier than me. We&#8217;re in a busy street but mostly cars and few fellow pedestrians, so if he turns out to be handsy and not just pushy this could be bad. Not exactly likely but screw you for making me have to do this calculation. Ehm, what would be the nearest place I could go to if he decides to end up following me if I left, like that dude last year?OK, here goes nothing.&#8217;)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Hit on doesn&#8217;t have a very specific connotation of aggressiveness AFAIK.  When I hear the phrase, it conjures anything from a guy flirting shamelessly&#8211;sometimes even as a gag&#8211;to the scenario described by March.  I mostly think of the milder stuff, but I&#8217;m not a woman so all I have to deal with is pleasant mild flirting.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t want to denigrate &#8216;hitting on&#8217; as some kind of problematic thing in itself. But it is if you don&#8217;t have any social confidence or experience and you only attract approaches from boors. Socially adept people hit on people skilfully and receive approaches skilfully, so the interaction quickly turns into mutual flirting or a graceful &#8216;thanks but no thanks&#8217; (both of which are very pleasant) rather than one-sided pushing. </p>
<p>&#8216;Hitting on&#8217; is stereotypically the main male flirt initiation after all, just like the main female flirt initiation is stuff like obvious hair twirling, glances, signaling that she&#8217;d like it if a certain person would come over. So it can&#8217;t really be wrong as a category. If the other person never says &#8216;yes&#8217; to that first &#8216;hit&#8217;, though, the interaction turns sour quickly. Just like with people who &#8216;stare&#8217; instead of &#8216;glance&#8217;.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Nah, even if it&#8217;s rare it can be unpleasant. If you&#8217;re an unattractive woman, you won&#8217;t suddenly get hit on in a charming way by an attractive guy. More likely it&#8217;ll be:<br />
The drunk guy at the party who has been rejected by all other women before getting around to you.<br />
Some homeless, ancient or otherwise very repulsive guy yelling &#8220;compliments&#8221; at you on the street.<br />
Someone who has read on the internet that ugly women are easy, and who gives off the attitude that you should be grateful for his attention and owe him reciprocation.</p>
<p>I guess these can still be a bit validating, at least you know someone would fuck you if given no better options. But it&#8217;s unpleasant as an experience: who knows if the drunk, homeless or desperate guy will accept a rejection gracefully? And sometimes &#8220;only this gross guy wants me&#8221; feels even worse than &#8220;nobody wants me&#8221;, although it&#8217;s not really rational.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The fuckzone has the same problem as the friendzone: the other person is stringing you on with promises of a possible future relationship. There are ways to let a person go, by either saying quite harsh truths, or, for those who can&#8217;t do it, you can just ghost the person.</p>
<p>Being friendzoned/fuckzoned prevents a new relationship from forming, because you don&#8217;t go looking for another one, since the mental headspace you dedicate to relationships is dedicated to that. But fuckzone is worse, since sex creates pair-bonding, and can reinforce feelings unilaterally.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d prefer to be friendzoned than fuckzoned.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Same, if I get friendzoned, at least I have a friend. If it&#8217;s the stereotypical friendzone where she always complains to me about her male partners, maybe I can also get some advice from her about my attempts to get a partner.</p>
<p>But if I regularly have sex with someone, that&#8217;s actively an obstacle to dating anyone else. So I&#8217;ll just have to ditch them to have a chance with another person. </p>
<p>But I think in neither case is the &#8220;zoning&#8221; person actively stringing the other one along. They know what they want from the zoned one, it&#8217;s just that the zoned person thinks this level of intimacy on one level should go with intimacy on the other level.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Having casual sex with someone is absolutely no obstacle to dating another person, for either sex.</p>
<p>For your third paragraph, &#8216;actively&#8217; is doing a lot of work. If you change it to &#8216;knowingly&#8217; then I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s most often true, for both zones.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;d like to see the &#8220;friendzone debate&#8221; address the idea that a friendship between two people, one of whom would like to be in a romantic relationship with the other, can still be a real friendship.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had an unrequited crush on a close friend before. It&#8217;s not pleasant. But it didn&#8217;t make me want to terminate the friendship (although certainly for some people in some situations pulling away a bit is the only option for their mental health <i>*cough cough Werther*</i>). And it didn&#8217;t mean one of us was using the other.</p>
<p>But the two perspectives seem to be either:</p>
<p>a) The woman is using the man for favors and support, the man isn&#8217;t getting anything out of it. He should leave and find a woman who won&#8217;t take advantage of him.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>b) The man is being an asshole by pretending to be the woman&#8217;s friend when really he only wanted sex.</p>
<p>Is it that uncommon that, in a genuine friendship, one party can develop unrequited feelings for the other? Or is that not considered to be the friendzone?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>There are people out there (redpill/pinkpill) who say that having a man feelings for a friend indicate that he&#8217;s only friends with them because he wants to fuck them. Such people are cynical about men in general, and in the communities they move in, they benefit from signalling that cynicism. They don&#8217;t offer much insight into people that they have no firsthand experience of. And personally I would find it sad and unfulfilling to live a life resembling theirs.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>This has been my experience as well. There were several guys throughout my high school and college years that I had unrequited crushes on. It occasionally sucked, but being able to hang out with them as friends still beat the alternative of not getting to hang out with them at all. </p>
<p>The hardest part was trying to be supportive when they were having relationship problems with their girlfriends, instead of saying &#8220;you know, you wouldn&#8217;t have these problems if you were dating me instead&#8230;&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think it&#8217;s variable.  In high school one of my good friends was a pretty, smart, kind, accomplished girl, and I did rather like her, but I felt that she could do better and didn&#8217;t want to make things go sour by forcing her to awkwardly turn me down.  I wasn&#8217;t, as far as I can recall, bitter about it at the time&#8211;and I was bitter a lot of the time.</p>
<p>If it had been a more powerful infatuation, I think dealing with it would have been too painful and I would have found myself resenting the girl.  In the event, I was a very lonesome young man and all the girls I pined after got pined after from afar, and friendship was out of the question.  That would have required me to talk to them.</p>
<p>Then I met a girl, fell in love, got married, and we&#8217;ve lasted ten years so far so yay.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The thing about a and b is that they are neither discrete nor mutually exclusive. I would say that in the vast majority of such cases, both are partly true to varying degrees &#8211; and usually not to an extent that really makes either party a bad person, but often significantly enough that the friendship is intrinsically unhealthy and it would be better for everyone concerned if they saw less of each other, which is a difficult thing to achieve given both parties&#8217; short term incentives.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>They can certainly be unhealthy friendships. But in my limited experience, I&#8217;ve never seen a.</p>
<p>For me, and there was really only one friendship I had where my unrequited crush on the other person made it unhealthy until I withdrew from the friendship a bit (which I didn&#8217;t manage to do on my own, physical separation did), it went like this:</p>
<p>We meet, become friends, spend more time together / talk about more personal things, I realize I&#8217;m falling for her. At that point she tries to continue it the same way as a normal friendship, with normal ebbs and flows of how much time we spend together, while I get more needy and insecure, probably not making me a better person to spend time around. None of this involved favors/support becoming one-sided.</p>
<p>You could certainly argue that I was being disingenuous in some way by continuing to spend time with her as a friend and fantasizing about a relationship, but that&#8217;s not the same as only pretending to be her friend in the first place.  And since usually my unrequited crushes just settle down to normal friendships again, I usually consider it a good idea to just ignore them if I don&#8217;t see them going anywhere. In the situation I&#8217;m talking about, perhaps I felt too strongly for ignoring it to be a realistic option and I should have tried harder to withdraw from the friendship.</p>
<p>Maybe this relates to the whole demisexuality conversation from the other thread &#8230;</p>
<p>[EDIT: I do believe that the &#8220;classic friendzone&#8221; setup exists, and is mostly as you say, though. Just that when people talk about it they ignore that sometimes the friendship does come first or have more reality to it.]</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think I&#8217;ve been on both sides of favours/support becoming&#8230; not <i>entirely</i> one-sided, but substantially imbalanced. If someone is willing to do basically unreasonable things to help you out, it&#8217;s pretty difficult to always have the willpower not to ask them to. It&#8217;s also really easy to kid yourself that the situation isn&#8217;t really what it is long after there&#8217;s any other plausible explanation, and thus avoid an awkward conversation and potential bad feeling.</p>
<p>What I really hate about a lot of framings of the subject is the tendency to depict very ordinary human failings in basically decent people as the monstrous behaviour of contemptible creeps/manipulators.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>ISTM that there are way, way more ways for a friendship/dating interaction/relationship of some kind to *not* lead to a sexual or romantic relationship than for it to lead to one.  That can be about lack of sexual attraction on one or both sides, or lack of romantic attraction[1], or not really geting along/liking each other much as people, or prior commitments (maybe he&#8217;s married), hard-to-reconcile obstacles (religious or cultural differences, income/social class differences, one wants kids and the other doesn&#8217;t), practical issues (he&#8217;s in school and will have to move away in another year, she&#8217;s got a kid already and he doesn&#8217;t want to be a parent), etc.  </p>
<p>[1] I dated a woman for awhile with whom I was (and am) good friends, and we were very sexually compatible.  But I just didn&#8217;t feel much romantic attraction toward her.  (I wouldn&#8217;t have phrased it that way back then, but that&#8217;s what it was&#8211;I liked her but didn&#8217;t love her.)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I have heard this referred to as the &#8220;slutzone&#8221; rather than the &#8220;fuckzone&#8221;, but, yes, it is definitely a real phenomenon, the equal and opposite situation to the friendzone. Men and women are <i>different</i>. Sperm is cheap, while eggs are precious, so women are the gatekeepers of sex while men, who provide resources, are the gatekeepers of commitment.</p>
<p>This is even more obvious when you look at homosexual communities; liberated from the gatekeepers of their respective wants, gay men engage in astounding levels of promiscuous casual sex with one another while lesbian women move-in with each other at the drop of a hat (then promptly suffer <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian_bed_death" rel="nofollow ugc">lesbian bed death</a>). Hence <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-Haul_lesbian" rel="nofollow ugc">the joke</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Question: What does a lesbian bring on a second date?<br />
Answer: A U-Haul.</p>
<p>Question: What does a gay man bring on a second date?<br />
Answer: What second date?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;. . .talking about how horrible dating is for them. . .&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p> Not sure if there&#8217;s anything more to this than that, finding someone to love who loves you back was hard in the &#8217;80&#8217;s/early &#8217;90&#8217;s and from all accounts still is despite computerized &#8220;match making&#8221;.<br />
I had been in both sides of both zones, and I remember being eager for a &#8220;long-term-romantic-relationship&#8221;, me and my future wife had been &#8220;just friends&#8217; for over a year before I kissed her and when we finally got to the &#8220;fourth night stand&#8221; stage and she wanted me to stay every night I still insisted on spending time at &#8220;my own place&#8221; some nights (she would never stay the night at my much less private place) as I was romantically shell shocked and distracting, but eventually I moved in with her when I was 24 and she was 28, and with a few separations we&#8217;ve been together almost 30 years. </p>
<p>When I was 20 there had been a girl who wanted to move in with me, but I didn&#8217;t have my own place, so projecting from my past my guess for what would help both sets of &#8220;cels&#8221; to have romance would be:</p>
<p>1) Subsidized housing that had some privacy. </p>
<p>2) Subsidized motor vehicles to court with.</p>
<p>3) Plentiful discos/malt shops with jukeboxes/night clubs/etc.</p>
<p>4) Incomes with free time. </p>
<p>I suppose &#8220;free college for all&#8221; proposals come close. </p>
<p>In thinking of my past girlfriends FWLIW an older girl (29) that I dated when I was 21 I had heard she committed suicide, and I had hoped that the story was false, sadly this week I found the memorial program, but I did find the detail that while she died of complications from her jump some days later, in-between she converted to Christianity and was happy for some days, another old girlfriend is a lecturer at U.C.B., another got married in 2015 and moved to the U.K. (we still correspond), and the last girl I dated before I moved in with my future wife married one of the customers at the motorcycle shop I worked at for seven years, and we&#8217;re still friends. From my experience I&#8217;m well convinced that moving from one &#8220;zone&#8221; (friends only or sex partner only) to both is easier than finding someone to get to one of the &#8220;zones&#8221; in the first place, but what worked for me was 1) volunteer work, 2) interest in music, 3) <i>a lot </i> of time in night clubs. For other friends amateur theater did the trick, and I know @DavidFriedman met his wife via folk dancing, all of these take <i>unpaid time</i>, so unlikely if you work many hours.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>So, I recently got a new laptop.  Very abruptly, because the old one died and I needed to get the new one set up before class on Tuesday.  I wound up buying the only available model of laptop Best Buy had.  It&#8217;s much nicer than my old one in terms of specs &#8230; but it came loaded with &#8220;Windows 10 S.&#8221;  I had thought that MS could not make a worse mistake than Windows Me or Vista.  But nope.  They actually made a version of Windows that locks you out of using any software not made by Microsoft.  Fortunately they seem to have abandoned their original policy, when this abomination came out, of making people update to the more functional Windows 10 Pro for fifty bucks&#8211;basically holding your device hostage.  I was able to liberate my copy for free by downloading Firefox, trying to install it, and clicking a box that said &#8220;Yes, I want to switch out of this POS so I can use software I actually want.&#8221;  It did warn me that I would be unable to switch back, which is a bit like &#8220;warning&#8221; someone that if they order the brownie, it will come warm from the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.</p>
<p>Anyway.  Microsoft is obviously not quite what it used to be in terms of market dominance.  I still wonder, how has it retained as much dominance as it has?  It keeps making terrible unforced errors like this.  Does it just require prohibitive amounts of pooled skill to make and market a good OS?  Or is it sheer inertia?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>As obnoxious as this is to you or me, I can imagine it being a good idea for schools, people who only use their computers for spreadsheets and word processing, etc. It&#8217;s like a Chromebook: you trade liberty for safety.</p>
<p>Anyway I suspect the window to take the world by storm with a brand new OS closed about twenty years ago. Today, 99% of users demand an OS with the polish and &#8220;it just works&#8221; of Windows or MacOS, and since even popular Linux distributions still can&#8217;t quite deliver that, I assume it requires BigCorp-level resources to make and maintain such a thing. Also, there are network effects. Most software is distributed in Windows and Mac versions. People want to use the same software as the people they work with.</p>

<p>Microsoft can pay professionals to make Office <i>not</i> play nicely with Linux; Linux depends on amateurs to make Linux play well with Office.  And, while Linux&#8217;s amateurs have technical skill and may want to make the Linux/Office combination work well enough for their <i>own</i> purposes, they&#8217;ve never been very enthusiastic about making any part of Linux play well with non-nerds.  So I expect Microsoft&#8217;s professionals will have the edge in this arms race.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t know how much it applies to the specific discussion, but it&#8217;s important to remember that an absolute ton of Linux development is done by paid professionals, too, these days. Most large software companies have a division that contributes to large open source projects either as a specific focus or as a side effect of their real focus. Some companies that&#8217;s almost all they do.</p>
<p>Linux Kernel Developer is a pretty well compensated job.</p>
<p>I can imagine Linux-Windows interop is pretty fruitful work for many large companies. Indeed, some of the very best work being done on the matter right now is being done by Valve in support of Steam&#8217;s ability to run most of its games on any platform.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>How much of that development work is on desktop linux?<br />
If you&#8217;re throwing money at linux development (to commoditise your complement), shouldn&#8217;t you focus on servers/embedded computing/kernel for android as appropriate?  </p>
<p>But it&#8217;s nice that most of my steam library runs on linux.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>So it’s technically impractical to make a Linux build that plays nicely with software designed for Windows? </p></blockquote>
<p>I think it depends on MS&#8217; attitude: do they actively support it, actively try to hinder it, or remain agnostic?</p>
<blockquote><p>I use LibreOffice, which is the metastasized mutant descendant of the long-dead Corel WordPerfect</p></blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<p>LibreOffice is the descendant of StarOffice (via OpenOffice), I believe it was developed from scratch by Star Division to resemble the interface and be interoperable with files from the then current version of MS Word.  I don&#8217;t think it is based on WordPerfect (which I think was made available for Linux at some time).</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I recently bought a surface pro, and I have experienced a milder form of this problem; it&#8217;s the first OS where I cannot easily get app versions of google products. To be fair, I&#8217;ve used Android and Chromium for years, but the realization that I couldn&#8217;t get Google Books and download Thinking and Deciding came as a shock.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Network effects. People do not buy computers to use the OS, they buy computers to use software, and thus the best OS is the one with the most software available that people want to use. </p>
<p>Building a better-than-windows OS is fairly trivial. Building an OS which has an entire software ecology associated with it is very hard.</p>
<p>Which of course means that a version of windows that locks itself out of its own supporting software ecology is not just an unforced error it is a completely worthless version of windows.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>People keep saying that, but windoes isn’t thus unchanging thing. ..windows users are forced to relearn things</p></blockquote>
<p>The nice thing about Unix is that I can whip up command lines that I learnt more than twentyfive years ago, and they work as expected.</p>
<p>But nobody cares about Windows <i>users</i>.  Microsofts announces end of line for some product, and corporate IT departments plan unrolling replacements with varying degrees of enthusiasm.  Very rarely does anybody think about alternatives, and while there&#8217;s a ton of frustration with major changes (like ribbon menus in Office, new file formats, or getting entangled in hidden features windows 8), users in general treat updates as force majeure, some kind of natural phenomenon or act of God that they just have to accept.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>In retrospect, philosophical may not be the right word. This is why I shouldn&#8217;t post comments at midnight. I&#8217;ll try to explain what I mean. </p>
<p>Every Apple product I&#8217;ve used has seemed less user friendly than their competitors, and the vibe I get from Apple is that this is an intentional design choice. My iPod won&#8217;t let me transfer music from itself to the computer. Every time I&#8217;ve replaced my computer, I&#8217;ve had to download a third party program to move my legally-purchased music from my iPod to the new computer&#8217;s hard drive. Likewise, my iPhone won&#8217;t let me transfer photos by plugging it into my computer; instead, I have to download iCloud on my desktop and then manually move the photos over. And heaven forbid that something goes wrong with one of your Apple devices. The last time I was at an Apple store, I had to wait for 3+ hours, and see 3-4 different employees, and the entire time, I was thinking &#8220;you know, I could have maybe fixed this on my own if you people hadn&#8217;t built your devices to require special tools to get into.&#8221; And then there&#8217;s the forced password changes (I&#8217;ve been locked out of my account more than once because Apple decided to reset my password), and the fact that every time I update to the latest iOS, Apple returns all of my settings to the defaults without even asking.</p>
<p>It feels like Apple doesn&#8217;t trust their customers to be competent&#8230; or even law-abiding, in the case of the locked music transfers.</p>
<p>My experience with Apple&#8217;s computers has been marginally better than my experience with Apple&#8217;s mobile products, but that just means their computers crash once a day instead of two to three times in a row like the iPhone.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>So, um&#8230; speaking as someone who recently had a philosophical objection and quit using Macs, after having used them all her life&#8230;</p>
<p>That experience sounds very atypical?</p>
<p>Even with a PC, I can plug my iphone in and access the pictures on it easily; I assume music too, although I haven&#8217;t yet tried. With a Mac, iTunes was always asking me if I wanted to sync, or if I wanted to download photos* &#8211; to the point where it got a little annoying. After an early software update in my teens, my Apple computers stopped crashing &#8211; ever, period. (A program could crash, but you could always access the force-quit menu, or later on reset the system if <i>it</i> was the problem &#8211; for all I knew you could do that early on too, only the system was never the problem early on.) I think they may have stopped being crash-proof a couple years before I quit, but they were never anywhere near every day. </p>
<p>Also, Apple has never decided to reset my password, what on <i>earth,</i> that is obviously extremely bad behavior but I&#8217;ve never experienced it. And I&#8217;m still using an iPhone. I don&#8217;t think they even fret at me to change my password regularly. </p>
<p>It may be that I was closer to their model user (not a programmer/without the skills to build or repair my own computer, not generally using unusual programs, etc.) than you were? Or possibly something else. But, speaking as someone who quit using Apple computers in grand dudgeon, your description sounds much worse than my experience ever was.</p>
<p>*Edit: Although I just recalled that a few years before I quit, I wanted to download photos and couldn&#8217;t figure out how &#8211; I think I ended up by emailing them to myself. I assumed that was my ineptitude, not their bad design, and indeed it&#8217;s quite possible I accidentally told them I never wanted them to load the phone as a drive, but it&#8217;s still a point against my general impression of user-friendliness. I <i>think</i> that was a mac.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yeah, echoing Rebecca Friedman, my initial experience with macs seemed miraculous. Got my first Macbook in college, after ten years of fiddling with desktop pcs daily over issues with freezing, crashing, and internet outages. I experienced virtually no difficulties in that line ever again. iTunes could be annoying, and in recent years especially, the Apple experience has gone down hill&#8230;Apple Music and all that. To the point where I considered just buying a pc instead of another Macbook Air last year, given the expense. Went into Best Buy to play around with the options, and immediately encountered all kinds of weird glitches. Bought the Macbook Air. For the manner in which I use laptops, Macs have been worth every penny for that comparatively smooth experience.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Beyond office software, they&#8217;ve been the only real gaming option for awhile now. That&#8217;s why my personal computer is Windows; if I want to play, say, League of Legends, then Microsoft is the only game in town. And if LoL doesn&#8217;t have a Linux port, nothing does.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>And if LoL doesn’t have a Linux port, nothing does.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how to interpret this statement.  As a casual Linux gamer, I can play from a fair sized catalog of native games on Steam, and some Windows games are reported to work with various compatibility layers.  Sure, not every top title is available so it&#8217;s not for gamers who absolutely need to play any specific game.  But &#8220;nothing&#8221; is way too strong here.</p>

<p>Metaphorically</p>

<p>But I want to play specific games. I don&#8217;t want to play any game, I want to play the specific game I want to play. Saying there are many Linux games is no better than offering me Monopoly when I want to play D&amp;D. </p>
<p>League isn&#8217;t on Linux, World of Warcraft isn&#8217;t on Linux, Rocket League was on Linux and then got discontinued. If big blockbusters don&#8217;t get ported over, then the odds are extremely low that the game I want to play will work on Linux.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Today&#8217;s New York Times front page: bold gesture, or unconscionable grandstanding?</p>
<p>I consider myself a reasonably rational, well-informed, scientific-minded person, and I still don&#8217;t know what the $&amp;#$ to think about COVID-19. I don&#8217;t know if we&#8217;re overreacting, underreacting, or reacting at exactly the appropriate level. One trend I have noticed, though, is that every time it seems things just might be loosening up, psychologically and/or politically, I see a bunch of stories circulate on Facebook along the lines of, &#8220;I was a healthy 45-year-old woman, and coronavirus almost killed me,&#8221; or &#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m 30 years old. I didn&#8217;t die from COVID-19, but I will suffer the aftereffects for the rest of my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>This strikes me as unfair. Unfair to the people involved, certainly, but also unfair in that it singles out COVID-19 from other diseases. Lots of 45-year-old women get breast cancer. Some of these cancers are less aggressive, and are easily cured; others are super-aggressively metastatic and kill the person horribly within six months. I&#8217;m not saying COVID-19 is like the flu&#8211;I believe that it is worse&#8211;but some people barely suffer from the ordinary flu, others wind up in the ICU. It seems that the vast majority of people who contract COVID-19 sail through unharmed, but a small, extremely unfortunate percentage get hit by the 10,000-ton Coronavirus freight train (yes, I know, mixed metaphor). <b>Life is a crap shoot</b> (further mixing the metaphor).</p>
<p>I may be rambling here, but&#8230;it increasingly seems like our national goal in confronting COVID-19 is to completely eradicate existential risk. NO ONE is allowed to die. It&#8217;s like wanting to take your family out for a drive, then reading about a horrible wreck on the highway that killed a family of six, including an adorable toddler and a litter of puppies, and deciding to stay home for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Like I said, I don&#8217;t know what to think, and I am not an epidemiologist. I certainly don&#8217;t want to be that person who boldly goes out, lives life to the fullest, and turns out to have the exact genetic composition that allows COVID-19 to turn my internal organs into day-old scungilli.</p>
<p>I know Matt M. has been making this argument for weeks now, but it is only now starting to sink in with me. How many more deaths are we willing to accept from COVID-19? If the answer is ZERO, we are seriously heading down the wrong path.</p>

<p>As far as I have seen, this kind of thing is entirely anecdotal.  Any numbers of non-lethal but serious outcomes from COVID-19?  Ages and percentages?</p>

<p>How can this not produce a symptom that someone notices? They might not have been coughing, but surely they noticed they got winded doing things that were easy a couple weeks before and that breathing heavily was painful?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Nope. The lack of hard data on anything that isn&#8217;t &#8220;confirmed positive test&#8221; or &#8220;dead&#8221; is extremely frustrating. </p>
<p>Part of it is because, well, it&#8217;s impossible to know what the long-term effects of a disease are before you had a while for those effects to manifest. Are people who&#8217;ve recovered by experienced lung damage going to recover fully in the next 6 months? Maybe! But we don&#8217;t really know. </p>
<p>The best we can do now is probably to look at whether people who didn&#8217;t die from things like H1N1 and SARS Classic experienced long-term health problems. <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41413-020-0084-5" rel="nofollow ugc">Here</a> is a 15-year follow-up study on SARS patients who recovered. It looks like a mixed bag, with many folks experiencing long-term health issues but others mostly recovering fully. The trend the authors identified (at least w.r.t. lung damage) is that people tended to slowly recovery for a while and then eventually level off with some amount of degraded function. </p>
<p><a rel="nofollow"href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20337995/" rel="nofollow ugc">Here&#8217;s</a> an older study that finds similar results. Folks get better for a time but don&#8217;t recover completely, and are generally worse off than the public at large.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a different disease, so perhaps all of this is meaningless.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>People have a lot of mental filters to block out the bottomless pits of suffering all around them.</p>
<p>The biggest one I&#8217;ve encountered is aging &#8211; after being converted by Aubrey de Grey and his ilk, I&#8217;m constantly amazed at the mental contortions people put themselves into to not see it as the biggest cause of suffering that is, finally, almost within the reach of science. </p>
<p>I think a lot of people within the SSC commentariat may feel similar about their pet issues, especially the EA movement. Then again, it requires a bit of soul searching to stop being paralyzed and depressed by the newfound suffering all around you, so I do have empathy for people who just block the entire thing out.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>With respect to the nyt headline, I think mourning people that died in a collective, unusual event is natural and good. If your argument is that we should accept some amount of risk as the cost of doing business, then I would agree, and we can argue about what level of risk is appropriate. After 9/11, I thought the changes to security procedures were ineffective and actively corrosive, but the minutes of silence and very similar newspaper remembrances were entirely appropriate.</p>

<p>One of the unfortunate questions that (ETA: <i>in my opinion</i>, of course) has to be considered is the role of media attention in support for those procedures. Like, analogously, we all accept that children being kidnapped by strangers is a tragedy, but whipping people up into a panic about stranger danger for at least a generation now is plausibly a major cause of the ineffective and corrosive procedures.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yes! Exactly. The one complication I see is that &#8220;a very deadly flu&#8221; might not be identified as fast as covid has, because we wouldn&#8217;t be collecting all data for it as quickly and as thoroughly. But after a few weeks, things might look much the same. In fact, I believe that a lot of the pandemic measures in effect now have originally been developed with the intent of treating a flu pandemic.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The 80k number was later revised down to <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2017-2018.htm" rel="nofollow ugc">60k</a>, somewhat highlighting the relative <a rel="nofollow"href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/comparing-covid-19-deaths-to-flu-deaths-is-like-comparing-apples-to-oranges/" rel="nofollow ugc">squishiness</a> of the flu estimates. I still don&#8217;t think you could have something go from flu levels of deadliness to corona levels without something novel going on. The deaths of despair narrative might be a good example of a cause of death suddenly becoming more important, and it also generated a lot of news coverage and profiles of individuals.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s completely possible that, once (if) we get a COVID19 vaccine, we still will get 100k death yearly, but at that point without closing off the economy.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The main thing that caught my attention with the NYT thing is just how old (almost) everyone who has died was. I knew this already, but still, seeing it on a list like that made it very noticeable. This people were old. Really old. Makes it harder to worry about the virus, if anything.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The simple answer is that we don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s clear that COVID-19 does weird things to the human immune system, along with other parts of the body, and that we haven&#8217;t had nearly enough time to figure out what the long-term consequences of surviving COVID-19 infection are. <a rel="nofollow"href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-017-2302-3" rel="nofollow ugc">Older economic analyses</a> suggest a 16% decrease in quality of life for elderly patients surviving a pneumonia infection, along with a substantial (~5X) increase in indirect mortality risks; COVID-19 is probably worse in terms of its overall quality of life impact. The overall impact on younger patients is probably lighter, but anyone who requires hospitalization probably has a tough road ahead, regardless of age.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>As it happens I support easing of lockdowns, for various reasons. But I disagree quite a lot with what I perceive to be the gist of your comment. Correct me if you think I got it wrong. </p>
<p>Covid is not like cancer in two very important ways: </p>
<p>1. You currently have very few ways of preventing cancer. What you eat, your genetic makeup, pollution in the air, 100 different cancers&#8230; it&#8217;s all just a big mess. Covid on the other hand is by comparison crystal clear: avoid a virus and you&#8217;re good. </p>
<p>2. It&#8217;s very hard for a supervillain to double total cases of cancer. You need a lot of work to do this, even on purpose. Covid on the other hand has an exponential pattern, which makes doubling to be trivial, and 10x fluctuations in cases relatively easy. </p>
<p><i>So all in all, Covid is still a very low hanging fruit.</i> </p>
<p>Now, should we all stay locked in our houses for the rest of the year? The answer varies. I&#8217;d strongly suggest that for my father (or David here). They&#8217;re in a risk group, and have quite comfortable conditions in their home. My dad has an almost obscenely-sized garden &#8211; he can literally grow all his vegetables there if he&#8217;s so inclined. Little downside and quite a big upside in staying in. </p>
<p>Should I stay in the rest of the year? That&#8217;s going to be a predictably different answer for a very different set of conditions &#8211; starting with 40yo in good health. </p>
<p>And to get to the core of the matter: should we, as a society, force people to stay in? If not, should we strongly encourage them to do so? If yes, how strongly?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not an easy question, especially because it has some big problems: some people will make the wrong decisions &#8211; would you trust all elderly people to properly judge the situation and risks involved? How about people that have to work? How about inherent discrimination, like the 65 year old that very much wants to go to work tomorrow, but is caught between a rock and a hard place? Is it fair to him to let &#8220;everybody&#8221; go to work, when for him it&#8217;s likely a 5% risk of death?</p>
<p>I liked a lot your introduction, about not knowing &#8220;what the $&amp;#$ to think&#8221;. You&#8217;re very right here. The problem is pretty complicated. Beware of simple answers.</p>

<p>Nah, the comparison stands. They just don&#8217;t compare. As far as we can tell, and after decades of research, best you can do is change your cancer risk by around 20%. And some advice is literally choosing between different cancers, like birth control pill. </p>
<p>Covid on the other hand is all about small changes &#8211; big impact. Stay-in-home strategy works about 99% on an individual level. But there are many things you can do society wide to get to 80% &#8211; we&#8217;re arguing on which are best and which are worth it, but it&#8217;s pretty clear a combination of masks/hygiene/testing/avoiding groups can get us to 80%. </p>
<p>Actually, no, scratch that. Given the exponential nature of epidemics (vs cancers), that 80% reduction in infection risk is actually over 99% reduction of effects, society-wide. Your actions move R, and R changes effects.</p>
<p>The case for panic and lockdown is unfortunately crystal clear. Like I said, I&#8217;m not supporting it, but the argument chain for easing it is necessarily longer and needs to be stated carefully.</p>

<p>Well we&#8217;ve had COVID19 for less than a year.</p>
<p>Maybe in 2021 we will just notice kids don&#8217;t trasmit it too much so they can go to schools, restaurants have to half capacity, theaters have to cut capacity in a quarter and choirs and singing in church are verboten, but everything else is cool and we make the necessary economic adjustments. </p>
<p>Just as at some point we decided to start putting warnings on tobacco and stop selling radioactive glass because of Cancer. That was the low hanging fruit.</p>
<p>I think the main obstacle to reopening is to get people in the mindset that masks are here to stay, regardless of other adjustments to society we have to make otherwise.</p>

<p>Yes. It is just astonishing to me how little distinction is made between &#8220;what a person should do&#8221; and &#8220;what society should do&#8221;. These are two very different questions.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>FWIW, I agree with your sentiments. Wanting the risk of death to be zero is not an acceptable way to live, and it confuses me that so many people are advocating for this. I&#8217;ve been in contact with several people emotionally suffering a lot recently due to the lack of normal social interaction, mostly young people. Apparently this counts for nothing.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>For me I mostly feel this with children: I think we need to be much more risk tolerant with children in order to build better humans. Where it is possible to minimize the risk of catastrophic injury, great; but children must be enabled to endanger themselves so they may learn care.</p>
<p><i>obviously</i> I&#8217;m super biased. I grew up rurally and my favorite activities, stick fighting and tree climbing, could readily result in death or disfiguration if practiced injudiciously. I look back and I had an unusual amount of agency and autonomy for my age, and I think a big chunk of that can be attributed to being encouraged to take responsibility for my own safety where practical. Clearly there failure modes and pathologies to this sort of sentiment, but I think it&#8217;s a sentiment we could use more of.</p>

I grew up in a suburban area, felt myself to be by no means anything other than ordinary- certainly my parents were not unusually permissive as I was quite limited on screen time, desserts and the like- yet I roamed the forests with my friends for hours unsupervised, climbed the back of stadium bleachers, climbed over barbed wire fences, crawled over streams on fallen logs, etc.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I grew up in a city, but we spent summers in New England. I shot a bow, BB gun, and .22, all unsupervised, probably all by early teens at the latest. Melted lead pipe over a fire and poured it into molds to make toy soldiers. Wandered by myself in the woods. </p>
<p>That would have been in the 1950&#8217;s, and I don&#8217;t remember seeing it as unusual, aside from the fact that our summers put me somewhere those things were practical.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>We don&#8217;t want the risk of death to be zero, we ideally want the risk of getting covid to be zero. And that&#8217;s a goal that theoretically could be achieved by locking everyone up for a month and then aggressively tracing any cases that do pop up (as demonstrated by China). Whether that&#8217;s acceptable to you is a different question, but the infinite rolling lockdown exists precisely because we&#8217;re willing for the risk to be greater than zero, but not as great as it would be without lockdown.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Assuming all goes perfectly after that one month, you also have to indefinitely seal your borders (impose a 2-week quarantine on arrivals).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been wondering for a while&#8212;how did the people of Wuhan eat during all of this? And get essentials?</p>
<p>One major overlooked thing that is done in South Korea and a few other places is that when they put people in quarantine, they deliver or provide meals and essentials, I think at government expense. It appears that is how China was handling much of the Wuhan situation, since they were forcing so many into quarantine, where they were presumably fed by the government. </p>
<p>It seems to me that the kind of lockdown required to get anywhere close to eradicating this in a month, where the virus is widespread, requires exempting virtually no &#8220;essential workers,&#8221; and directly providing supplies. (This will generally mean that some regions of the country have to be open and providing resources for those locked down.)</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t want to say national goal, but definitely on some parts of twitter, reddit (r/coronavirus is the worst) and possibly in the heads of some politicians.

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I was going to say that! It sounds like the issue of having the interest group <i>most</i> effected dictate policy. On covid I, like Bobobob, am uncertain, but the notion that there must be an acceptable threshold of harm seems valid to me. </p>
<p>On the flipside, I have this theory that those who have the greatest stake in the continuation of the economy, i.e. capitalists in the old sense of &#8220;owners of capital&#8221;, are most prone to opposing the lockdown because their incentive matrix differs from those who do not own capital.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I always find it worthwhile to consider the big picture in cases like this.</p>
<p>Checking the <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db355_tables-508.pdf#page=4" rel="nofollow ugc">CDC&#8217;s numbers</a>, there were 2,839,205 deaths in the U.S. in 2018. This works out to 236,600 deaths monthly.</p>
<p>Going by <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States" rel="nofollow ugc">Wikipedia</a>, the first U.S. COVID-19 deaths were recorded on 13th March, which means just over two months have passed. Based on 2018 data, we would expect ~473,200 people to die over two months, so the 100,000 COVID-19 deaths account for roughly one fifth of deaths expected over that period.</p>
<p>How many of those are excess deaths? I don&#8217;t have any good data. Given that risk of COVID-19 death is positively correlated with both age and co-morbidities, it&#8217;s a fair bet that some aren&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The headline annoys me because of what is absent: the much greater number of people who died of causes unrelated to COVID-19 during this period. Those deaths aren&#8217;t an incalculable loss, presumably.</p>
<p>Oh wait, no. It&#8217;s simply the NYT editors going for the low-hanging emotional blackmail. This is why we can&#8217;t have nice things.</p>
<p>If I could single out one villain in this whole pandemic saga, the media is it.</p>

<p>The sixth person on the list, IIRC, was killed in a homicide. Bad computer grepping (that failed to be caught by editing) made it look like a coronavirus death.</p>

<blockquote><p>If the NYT printed the names of the people who died from 9-11 (it wouldn’t surprise me if they did), is this also emotional blackmail since they didn’t mention all the people who died from non-terrorism-related-causes that day?</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, probably.</p>
<p>Given that the ostensible purpose of newspapers is to inform the reading public, just what would you say is the informational value of printing the names of all the people who died of X?</p>
<p>Bobobob has a point about a singular disaster scenario like 9/11, where &#8220;did someone I know who was on site survive?&#8221; is an understandable question. Even then, I&#8217;m not at all certain the NYT front page is the best place for disseminating such information.</p>
<p>In the case of &#8220;ill person died&#8221;, there&#8217;s simply no excuse. How many patients died in your hospital during your internship? How many of those made the NYT front page? How many should have?</p>

<blockquote><p>You mean the NYT that ran editorials like ‘An Iraq War Won’t Destabilize the Mideast’?</p></blockquote>
<p>This is arguably true, but in a misleading fashion. There is indeed an <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/26/opinion/an-iraq-war-won-t-destabilize-the-mideast.html" rel="nofollow ugc">op-ed</a> with that title by Reuel Marc Gerecht, at the time (as far as I can tell, his bio is unclear on timing) a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. There is a difference between an op-ed, intended to allow a broad range of views to be published and an editorial, intended to convey the opinion of the editorial board.</p>
<p>The only <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/03/opinion/a-time-for-candor-on-iraq.html" rel="nofollow ugc">editorial </a>my quick search could find on the topic in 2002 says:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is time for Mr. Bush to level with the nation about his intentions and to talk candidly about why he feels military action against Iraq may soon be necessary, and what the goals, costs and potential consequences of a war would be.&#8221;</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>&#8220;Military victory in Iraq would leave Washington temporarily responsible for guiding the future of a major Arab oil-producing country in the heart of the Middle East. The first challenge would be preventing Iraq&#8217;s dissolution. The country&#8217;s volatile mix of Shiites and Sunnis, Arabs and Kurds has been held together only by brute force. A splintered Iraq would tempt Iran, frighten Turkey and perhaps lead to regional war. Remaking Iraq through prolonged American military occupation, on the model of postwar Germany, seems unrealistic. Yet too rapid an American pullout could allow a new strongman to emerge, rearm and seek revenge.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>It’s simply the NYT editors going for the low-hanging emotional blackmail.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a somewhat extraordinary claim. The urge to memorialize events where lots of people died does not seem confined to situations where there is a policy disagreement about the response. Did the New Zealand government build a memorial to blackmail people into increased earthquake preparedness? Did Reagan give the challenger speech to evangelize thermal testing of o-rings? Listing people&#8217;s names is about as neutral and common a memorial as you can get.</p>

<p>Given that the shelf-life of a daily&#8217;s front page is &#8211; quite famously &#8211; one day &#8220;memorial&#8221; doesn&#8217;t seem to be a very appropriate term.</p>
<p>Leaving that aside, to memorialize a person or event is always a political choice, but doubly so in this case.</p>
<p>The examples you quote were one-off extraordinary events. More people die on the roads on an average day than died in the Challenger. Does the President address all of those? With Challenger, the matter is at least understandable in that Challenger was the U.S. Government&#8217;s responsibility. It&#8217;s pretty much the President&#8217;s duty to step up and say something when a high-profile government project goes horribly wrong.</p>
<p>I am unfamiliar with the New Zealand example. How many earthquakes does New Zealand get? What makes this one special?</p>
<p>COVID-19 is simply a specific case of &#8220;sick people sometimes die&#8221;, so we need to explain why we care about this particular instance and not all of the other ones. It doesn&#8217;t appear considerably more deadly nor infectious than a bunch of other diseases we&#8217;re dealing with. Just the fact that we can begin to consider such a &#8220;memorial&#8221; should be sufficient evidence of this (if it were as deadly as the early models made it out to be, there&#8217;d be too many bodies by now).</p>
<p>Even if we assume that <i>some</i> memorials can be politically neutral, it does not follow that <i>all</i> memorials are, much less this one.</p>
<p>Hmmm, let&#8217;s check the editorial: <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/24/opinion/coronavirus-us.html" rel="nofollow ugc"><i>The Most Patriotic Thing You Can Do Right Now</i></a>. What could that possibly be?</p>

<p>I thought that was the point.</p>
<blockquote><p>Whatever horrible distopian ‘for your own good’ thing you can come up with, you’d have to go pretty far before it crosses a line we haven’t just crossed here.</p></blockquote>
<p>I see the current situation not so much as something that may lead us to further bad things down the line, but rather the culmination of a many-year effort to bring such a state about. This year&#8217;s pandemic response is the first time it really worked.</p>
<p><i>Of course</i> it&#8217;s going to be used as justification for other things. It&#8217;s already happening. Proposals for the &#8220;new normal&#8221; are a dime a dozen and entirely predictable because they all inexplicably happen to be the proposing party&#8217;s hobby horse.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;ve had this concern from the beginning. </p>
<p>FWIW, I don&#8217;t think the people making the decisions have a goal of zero deaths; I think they are afraid to admit that some amount of deaths are acceptable, let alone explain what amount they have in mind.</p>
<p>There was &#8211; theoretically at least &#8211; the possibility of eradictating the disease, as was done with e.g. SARS, if the whole world had done in Jan/Feb what it instead did in March/April, and if it had done so without holdouts like Brazil. By the time we actually locked down, that possibility was gone, though we didn&#8217;t yet know just how much community spread there had already been. The only reasonable goal was to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed. </p>
<p>Since then, it looks like there are many people in favour of reducing the total deaths by keeping the rate of infection low enough that it doesn&#8217;t make it through all/most of the population before an effective vaccine is developed. I&#8217;m not a virologist, but I&#8217;ve never believed that was possible; there&#8217;s just too much work that has to be done outside of isolation bubbles in order to keep people fed and otherwise healthy that long. </p>
<p>That leaves isolating (or self-isolating) the extremely vulnerable. On the one hand, we&#8217;ve already dropped the ball on that &#8211; for every David Friedman, there are several folks in long term care facilities, and handling those facilities has been badly botched just about everywhere. In many jurisdictions, actively harmful policies were pursued with regard to such facilities well after a prudent person would have considered them too risky, though they were sometimes stopped after they were proven to be actively making things worse. And on the other hand, solitary confinement is regarded as a severe punishment for a reason &#8211; people living alone aren&#8217;t in good shape even after the amount of lockdown we&#8217;ve already experienced.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I appreciate the drumbeat pointing out that even babies can die from Covid-19. I&#8217;ve seen too many people calculating that the deaths of older people don&#8217;t really matter, and I&#8217;m old enough to identify with those who would be sacrificed to the &#8220;common good&#8221; in those net.commentors&#8217; vision of a desirable response. </p>
<p>Also, of course, the news is probably just &#8220;man bites dog&#8221; &#8211; grandfather dies of covid-19 -&gt; not newsworthy, unless he&#8217;s famous for some other reason. Baby girl dies -&gt; very newsworthy, since it doesn&#8217;t happen often.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to articulate this, but I believe there is just so much that is at risk of falling apart in ways that we can&#8217;t really see. The conditions required to support what seem like sensible enough steps are likely unsustainable, and we won&#8217;t see it until it&#8217;s too late. </p>
<p>Kind of related to this is the Midland Dam thing. It&#8217;s easy to see situations where impending problems go overlooked in the pandemic because nobody is at a certain warehouse or whatever, or a certain machine that requires constant use or maintenance sits idle and then malfunctions when turned on. But even ignoring that possibility&#8211;I know the dam&#8217;s problems long pre-dated this issue&#8211;imagine the situation of the people in that area. They have been staying home, probably suffering some level of economic damage, in the hope of a vaccine. Now, overnight, the social distancing efforts of thousands of people have become untenable, as they have to go to shelters or move in with elderly relatives. They are now in much worse economic shape, with little room to maneuver and a pretty unpredictable future. Relying on friends and family is especially difficult &#8212; many of them are economically distressed. People are being placed into a vulnerable position, which is manageable if nothing else happens and it is short-term. But it probably isn&#8217;t very short-term, and if so, we absolutely can&#8217;t count on nothing else happening.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>How many more deaths are we willing to accept from COVID-19? If the answer is ZERO, we are seriously heading down the wrong path.</p></blockquote>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t have to be zero, it just has to be enough to flip the risk from &#8220;Intolerably Dangerous&#8221; to &#8220;Completely Safe&#8221;.  That&#8217;s well above zero, but it&#8217;s a highly subjective sliding scale rather than a fixed number.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, one of the subjective factors is &#8220;how much would it cost us to make this Completely Safe, if we decide it isn&#8217;t so already?&#8221;.  That&#8217;s why e.g. automobiles are Completely Safe so long as not driven while drunk, even though things with much smaller body counts are Intolerably Dangerous.  And right now, part of the cost of putting COVID-19 in the &#8220;Completely Safe&#8221; category is giving up a culture-war cudgel that Blue Tribe can use to bash Red Tribe as being lethally dangerous uncaring idiots.  </p>
<p>It would work a lot better if there were a &#8220;Manageable Risk&#8221; category between the two, but that&#8217;s more of a Red Tribe thing.  And Black and Brown tribes, of course, from long experience being stuck dealing with shit that was no way near &#8220;Completely Safe&#8221;.</p>

<p>Yes, this is what I want. It&#8217;s not that COVID-19 isn&#8217;t dangerous, but it&#8217;s a Category 3 plague and we&#8217;re doing the Category 4 response. The correct answer is not the Category 2 response, but the Category 3 response.</p>

<blockquote><p>
This strikes me as unfair. Unfair to the people involved, certainly, but also unfair in that it singles out COVID-19 from other diseases. Lots of 45-year-old women get breast cancer. Some of these cancers are less aggressive, and are easily cured; others are super-aggressively metastatic and kill the person horribly within six months. I’m not saying COVID-19 is like the flu–I believe that it is worse–but some people barely suffer from the ordinary flu, others wind up in the ICU. It seems that the vast majority of people who contract COVID-19 sail through unharmed, but a small, extremely unfortunate percentage get hit by the 10,000-ton Coronavirus freight train (yes, I know, mixed metaphor). Life is a crap shoot (further mixing the metaphor).</p></blockquote>
<p>Right before this started, an acquaintance lost a college-aged relative to cancer. We keep pretending like COVID-19 is some new horror show giving people what they don&#8217;t deserve. It may be a greatly increased threat for some groups, but the occasional 30-year-old dying is both awful and not at all a new thing. 30-year-olds get cancer and other horrific conditions all the time. Some people get a raw deal. This isn&#8217;t a preventable thing. We should acknowledge this. We should also acknowledge that every day, people watch loved ones of all ages die painful deaths of cancer and other diseases, which often strike healthy people seemingly out of nowhere. Ignoring this reality, treating it as a matter of choice and beyond comprehension, just disturbs me on many levels, even if the response will be that they&#8217;re only trying to stop the same from happening to others. The implicit or sometimes even explicit question in much of the discussion is: &#8220;Stop being complacent and ask yourself, &#8216;What if your healthy grandmother suddenly died a horrible death when you didn&#8217;t even think of her as elderly?'&#8221; And my natural reaction is, &#8220;That happened to me 5 years ago, so I am well aware it could happen and is extremely devastating.&#8221; Obviously, it&#8217;s not a personal provocation on their part, but the obliviousness and the assumption of obliviousness in everyone else nonetheless provokes something in me. It invalidates people&#8217;s lived experience, or whatever the term is. This seeming commitment to the eradication of existential risk indicates a dangerous detachment from reality on a lot of levels. And we&#8217;re being encouraged to think that way, even though it is transparently absurd and anomalous.</p>
<blockquote><p>
I consider myself a reasonably rational, well-informed, scientific-minded person, and I still don’t know what the $&amp;#$ to think about COVID-19. I don’t know if we’re overreacting, underreacting, or reacting at exactly the appropriate level. </p></blockquote>
<p>Definitely relate to this as well. And I don&#8217;t think anyone can know exactly. But whether or not we&#8217;re reacting with the right level of concern, I&#8217;m pretty confident we&#8217;re not reacting the right way. We don&#8217;t have control of this, and probably won&#8217;t have &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; levels of control of it within any reasonable time frame. We aren&#8217;t asking some of the biggest questions. I have felt similarly to Matt M. from the beginning, and certain things are making this clearer for me. </p>
<p>We have to look at the big issues here, and it is easier to orient once we do. These are just two things I think have major implications that we are not discussing very seriously:</p>
<p>1) It is a mistake to count on a vaccine to save us, though of course we should try for a vaccine and pray for a miracle. If we pull it off, I cannot believe it will happen in less than 3 years at the absolute best. Creating one, making sure it is safe (you *don&#8217;t* want to rush this too much), manufacturing it, getting it distributed to this many people at once&#8230;.we must stop centering our conversation around this longshot. I might be wrong about the odds, but I see no situation in which it is smart to act as if this is guaranteed. Sufficiently accurate tests also seem a long way off, which means 14-day quarantine rules have killed global travel anywhere that adopts a strict containment strategy. Singapore, South Korea, and New Zealand are expecting enormous, long-term economic problems as a result. </p>
<p>2) Talking and singing seem to be pretty high risk. The obvious response is &#8220;no super spreader events.&#8221; This seems like an easy answer. Too high risk, and who will go? But phrase it this way: Are we willing to give up parties, funerals, sports, concerts, gyms, office interaction, conventions, travel, school and church, and the jobs associated with this, for a minimum of three years? After this sinks in a bit, I think very few Americans would answer yes to this. Even high risk Americans, particularly the elderly. It&#8217;s not realistic or desirable. Some more vulnerable people would still choose to isolate themselves, but I think most would resign themselves to the risk. That is just not sufficient quality of life for most people, but most people are still thinking they only have to wait a bit longer. Making the priority minimizing spread isn&#8217;t as sensible as it looks when you lay it out more realistically. I&#8217;m not even sure what to do about nursing homes: on the one hand, clearly it can&#8217;t be allowed to enter in the first place, and we have to somehow come up with the resources for a staff that never leaves. On the other hand, how many of these people want to maximize their lifespan if the trade off is no visits from family members? </p>
<p>3) Once tradeoffs are acknowledged, we will see rapid shifts in expectations, and things that seemed unacceptable will be accepted. Until then, it will be hard to make sense of a lot of this. Judging what we&#8217;ll accept in relation to how much it diverges from the pre-pandemic status quo will be less and less useful, because that status quo is gone. I can&#8217;t predict anything specific, other than that eradicating existential risk is definitely not on the table, and never was.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>To me it is making a political statement that these deaths of this type are more important than other deaths. And that we should do all we can to prevent more.</p>
<p>For the last few years I&#8217;ve given 2% of my salary to givewell.org for schistosomiasis or malaria. I feel like the guy who was a fan of the band when they were small, and now that the band is a big hit, everyone has jumped on board. Suddenly everyone gives a shit about saving as many lives as possible no matter the cost. But just as they call themselves fans but can&#8217;t even name a song on the first three albums, they act like this is the first time it has been possible to save human lives with money. And when we want to do cost-benefit analysis this time, they act like they are the first people on earth who ever gave a damn about saving lives.</p>
<p>Even though they have spent their whole lives ignoring charities and scrolling straight past their friends of friends give-a-little pages. And trading their own quantity of life for extra quality, with alcohol and delicious food.</p>

<p>You make that sound negative.  Surely, you should be happy that more people have come to see the light, and are contributing effectively?  And maybe pat yourself on the back for being ahead of the curve, without being arrogant or condescending about it?</p>

<p>Not what I meant!  But I think I misunderstood this:</p>

<p>&#8230;to mean that your friends are now suddenly also donating to GiveWell, which sounds like a win for everybody.  After are-read, I think you mean they suddenly (pretend to) care about saving lives in the context of COVID-19, which is something else.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I don&#8217;t think the things you are describing are the same kind of thing.</p>
<p>The effective altruism movement is very much about putting a $ amount on a life. They then check which lives can be saved for the least $, and focus on that. EA very much does not focus on citizens of rich countries; they focus on the cheapest value of $ per life.</p>
<p>This whole coronavirus bondoogle is about refusing to put any $$$ on a life, and measuring whether it&#8217;s worth it. It&#8217;s completely different.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I just don&#8217;t like being lectured to about valuing human lives by people who have never given to charity. It is easy to advocate for spending huge amounts to help people when it isn&#8217;t your money.</p>
<p>That really isn&#8217;t being very fair though. I know most people just don&#8217;t have the context to think about the costs, the media is not providing it, and it is a complicated and ambiguous thing anyway. GDP, government debt and unemployment numbers and all that are very abstract, and human lives are concrete.</p>

<p>They clearly chose not to and went on to sacrifice some people. Which is fine, nobody wants to spend infinite money to save one life. Hell, they&#8217;ve said what was the death toll expected with their strategy, 100k to 200k deaths, and so far, they seem to be on target. </p>
<p>Saying that the gov wanted zero deaths is not accurate.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s like saying that if Poland hadn&#8217;t wanted to be conquered by the Nazis, they could have done what the Russians did.  The United States didn&#8217;t have the efficient, practiced infectious-disease control service that South Korea and New Zealand did, and it didn&#8217;t have the geographic isolation of New Zealand in particular, so no, the United States could not have done what South Korea and New Zealand did.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>hat’s like saying that if Poland hadn’t wanted to be conquered by the Nazis, they could have done what the Russians did. The United States didn’t have the efficient, practiced infectious-disease control service that South Korea and New Zealand did, and it didn’t have the geographic isolation of New Zealand in particular, so no, the United States could not have done what South Korea and New Zealand did.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s another way of saying &#8220;USA accepted a lot of possible deaths under a flu-like sickness, while SK/NZ did not&#8221;. Preparedness is a choice and a cost countries bear too. </p>
<p>But even then the USA could still have gone into lockdown earlier on to give time to the CDC to realize their tests weren&#8217;t up to par. Trump did start to close the country early on, so it&#8217;s not like the USA did nothing. Just not enough. </p>
<p>Even if they couldn&#8217;t follow the same playbook as SK/NZ due to geographical situation, they chose not to act early on. And geography may not be as critical as you think; Uruguay is next to Brazil, a country whose president has decided to do literally nothing about the virus -and is fighting its own government to keep that position- and is largely free of covid deaths. 22 so far. Without closing the economy as much as its neighbours.</p>
<p>Maybe you think geography matters because the USA is large while NZ/SK/Uruguay are tiny? but there are few countries as big  like the USA. I&#8217;d say there are 4 (USA, Russia, Canada and China) and they are too few to make generalizations. </p>
<p>But I want to point out that the country that had the less warning about the sickness and a similar size and waaay more population than the USA, China, has done way better than the USA so far. So size may not be an excuse either.</p>

<p>China has what? 4x the population of the USA? they&#8217;d have to have 400K deaths to put it in &#8220;as bad as the USA&#8221; territory. They&#8217;d have to lying 100x.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>NZ went into lockdown March 23rd with 100 cases. At the time, the US had 50,000 cases and Italy had 63,000. NZ was only successful because they had three weeks more warning than the US. NZ was not prepared at all: we didn&#8217;t have any testing in place, or any masks, or any contact tracing, or any culture of worrying about this stuff. We just got our government contact tracing app two days ago.</p>
<p>What we did have was plenty of advance warning and competent government, both the current leadership and the long term systems which are much more flexible than the US. The most crucial factor though was the advance warning.</p>
<p>EDIT: It also came up in the last week that NZ wasn&#8217;t actually trying to eradicate at the start. They switched to that strategy when it started to look feasible.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>The analogy with the polish/russians is silly and won&#8217;t entertain it.</p>
<blockquote><p>“You should have been better prepared” is so much more persuasive in hindsight than in foresight, that it should almost always be dismissed out of hand when someone offers it in hindsight.

<p>But the truth is&#8230;you should have been prepared. Other countries were prepared. This is not space aliens with ships the size of moons taking away our cars. This was a real threat, people warned about something like it happening years ago, and instead Trump tried to defund the CDC. </p>
<p>Choosing to have a non efficient disease control as part of the government was a silly decision. Yes, it is assholish to point it out in hindsight, but the point here is that the government decided to act that way.</p>
<p>And in that decision it said the government is ok with 100k deaths and the stoppage of the economy. </p>
<p>The original point was that people were acting as if 0 deaths was acceptable. That is not true. The government accepted deaths before hand (by not investing enough) and afterwards (by reacting slowly and setting themselves their acceptable deaths target).</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t any sort of decision.  Non-efficient government isn&#8217;t a <i>choice</i>, it&#8217;s the default.  It is not only what you get if you don&#8217;t make a choice, it is what you get if you &#8220;chose highly efficient disease control&#8221; (or whatever) and don&#8217;t follow that up with a substantial commitment of political capital that cannot be sustained across the whole of possible government activity.</p>
<p>Actually <i>achieving</i> highly efficient disease control, requires choosing some <i>other</i> substantial thing the government might do, and either not doing that thing or allowing it to be done poorly.  I am certain you can think of candiates for that sacrifice, but for every plausible candidate I can posit a scenario where a hundred thousand people die because of it.</p>

<p>To back up what john schilling said, imagine that 2 years ago trump got up on the stump with a report about unsanitary conditions in wet markets in china and started campaigning on the vital importance of disease preparedness.  Do you really think that would have gone well for him?  or do you think that he would have been called a fear mongering fascist?</p>

<p>I feel this attitude is part of the problem, though. If voters think the government cannot do good, if the president says that the government is the problem, well, this is what you get.</p>
<p>Besides, what government duty do you think the South Korean government is not doing that America is doing right? Or New Zealand? What part of the government of America is doing so great to pay for the good disease control of SK/NZ?</p>

<p>Oh wait, I misread. Ok, no, you are right. Me bad. </p>
<p>If Trump had done everything right and he had deaths in the hundreds (as proportional to the populations of successful countries predicts) then that&#8217;d be great, yeah. And we&#8217;d have the UK/parts of Europe to compare and tell he did right.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not what happened.</p>
<blockquote><p>

<p>Ok, but I feel that still the American government is particularly bad at &#8230; a lot of things &#8230; in comparison with other developed countries. I do not think that government-potential-good is a zero sum game. On the contrary, doing well in some areas may help other areas. If we somehow divided the NZ/SK government in areas comparable to the american one, I suspect the former would come out on top overall in evaluation to the later.</p>

<p>Eh, dunno. Bush Jr, a republican, seemed worried about this kind of problems and worked to prepare america for it, and Obama, of the opposite political side, seemed to continue that legacy.

<p>Of course we cannot look at the counterfactual world where President Clinton bungles the COVID response to know, but it is clear that american presidents _could_ prepare the government, without being accused of fearmongering. Because two presidents of opposing sides just did.</p>
<blockquote><p>The US is also a lot bigger and less homogenous than the other developed countries. that makes everything harder. new zealand is an island with population smaller than the average state, and south korea has 150 miles of border and half a dozen international airports.</p></blockquote>
<p>Eh, there will always be excuses. The size, complexity and hetereogenity of America helps it be one of the biggest economies of the world, but somehow cannot coordinate to get a good government going. But when America decided to put a man on the moon, the size and complexity of the country did not matter. On the contrary, it helped. Which means its government clearly can coordinate to do great things, but I think something broke in America at some point and now it cannot do that kind of thing anymore. And part of it may be that people think their government is the problem.</p>

<p>Bush did care, but he and Obama didn&#8217;t meaningfully prepare for it, in a way that would have made a massive difference. They prioritized other things. Pretty sure Trump&#8217;s changes had basically zero effect&#8211;these were just groups  writing the same reports that had been ignored by early administrations. Virtually no one in the U.S. leadership class took it seriously in a way that would have allowed a mass mobilization. I agree with you that the U.S. has weaknesses here, but they weren&#8217;t mainly Trump-related. They were mainly CDC, FDA, WHO etc. problems, and it wasn&#8217;t due to lack of funding, but the institutional mindsets. But almost no countries were really talking about total eradication&#8212;back in February, the NYT was publishing pieces in which the international consensus seemed to be the virus could well be with us every flu season. That came later.</p>
<p>What NZ and S. Korea and others did that we did not do, above all, was catch the early cases before there was significant spread, by intercepting airport arrivals and restricting travel. S. Korea had also prepared after SARs, and had some good systems in  place, which neither the U.S. nor NZ did. This is where one can criticize the U.S. response&#8211;not acting early, or thinking much of SARs. Most countries made the same mistakes. Once it is widespread, there  won&#8217;t be eradication absent a vaccine. I won&#8217;t comment on  China because I don&#8217;t know whether to trust them. I agree it seems more under control than elsewhere, but they are still having outbreaks and Chinese scientists today said they thought it was  probably endemic. They seem to have gotten it under control by placing people into monitored quarantine centers. Most other countries weren&#8217;t willing to do that.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>JPNunez,</p>
<p>Just to reiterate, New Zealand wasn&#8217;t successful at eradication because they were prepared at all, which they weren&#8217;t. They succeeded because they had a full three weeks of extra time to shut down the borders compared to the US. Italy was a total shitshow by that time so it was a lot more obvious March 23rd that drastic action was feasible and maybe a good idea.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t invalidate your point at all and I agree that the US has institutional problems that hampered their response. But you can use Taiwan and South Korea as your good examples instead of NZ.</p>

<p>the size of the US is irrelevant to the problem of putting someone on the moon.  It&#8217;s not irrelevant to the problem of coordinating a plague response.  </p>

<p>Large government bureaucracies are good at problems that (A) they are organized around and dedicated to and (B) have solutions that are straightforward and require few tradeoffs between stakeholders. Neither of those applies to covid in the US, and USG could not have been realistically reshaped to make it so.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Seconded that there&#8217;s a pretty good Tom Clancy novel in there.  But I really wanted the payoff from the virtual world.  The Apostropocalypse and the epic battle between the Earthtone coalition and the Forces of Brightness were ideas worthy of a Neal Stephenson novel, and I never really stopped feeling cheated about that whole plot being dropped.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Those Doritos you were craving? They&#8217;re gone, man. Just gone. There are no Doritos in this world, now. </p>
<p>The aliens with spaceships the size of small moons are back at it. This time, they&#8217;ve taken all our food. They&#8217;ve left all unharvested plants and livestock on the hoof, but they&#8217;ve taken all the grain and produce that has already been harvested and all the animals that have been butchered. And of course they have taken all the finished and processed food-stuffs. The farms, farmers, farm-equipment, and inputs such as fertilizer are all still in place.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m guessing the people still alive are a rounding error. Maybe a few of the most rural preppers who actually have their own gardens. Possibly one or two amish/mennonite communities? I&#8217;m guessing it would depend on when this happened. If it was close to harvest time the chances would be a bit better.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Barely anyone survives, maybe some remote groups of hunter / gatherers, certain types of subsistence farmers, and people who mostly live off fish they catch.</p>
<p>In most places, there might be enough food-plants and animals around to keep a minority of the population alive until harvest time, but I expect there&#8217;d be a lot of fighting over it. So it won&#8217;t exactly be distributed in a rational manner. There will be places where everybody dies.</p>
<p>I guess our main hope is that the aliens forgot to take things that are edible but not strictly food <i>as such</i>, and we&#8217;ll all be eating starch packing nuggets and cardboard for a few months. Maybe it&#8217;s even possible to make petrol edible?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Basically, we need to keep things going until the next harvest, whenever that will be. Different places and different crops have different harvest times.</p>
<p>International trade for food will probably be impossible. Some countries might actually raid others for food.</p>
<p>Living livestock can be slaughtered. That&#8217;s a once-only contribution, but it will buy time.</p>
<p>We can catch fish, and we won&#8217;t worry about sustainability. And we won&#8217;t just catch the usual palatable/popular varieties. We&#8217;ll catch whatever we can get.</p>
<p>Any hope for industrial synthesis of food from inorganic chemical sources? Glucose isn&#8217;t a particularly complicated molecule.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>We could probably eat some machine oils for fats, and paper, wood, cellulose in general for fiber. The main problem is protein, but since animals are still around, we might be able to consume eggs and milk (assuming society doesn&#8217;t break down). If we run out of food for the animals, we can slaughter them. For micronutrients, there&#8217;s supplements, if the aliens didn&#8217;t take them. All that might allow us to survive a few months until the next harvest.<br />
So I guess in theory this could just be a &#8220;major worldwide famine&#8221; if we react smartly and quickly. Maybe the majority of people could survive.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Do we get to eat the seed corn?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a billion cows. Each has about 200kg of retail meat and some amount of offal.<br />
Beef contains about 10kJ/g of energy. 4MJ/day is starvation rations.<br />
That works out to about 71 days.  </p>
<p>EDIT: fungi might be a way to convert biomass to a form humans can eat. Cut down the forests and cover them with mushroom spores?</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><blockquote><p>There’s a billion cows [&#8230;] That works out to about 71 days.</p></blockquote>
<p>At 400g meat per day (which I get from your numbers), a human should keep another human alive for maybe 80 days, which would be the half-life of the population.</p>
<p>We have enough people for about 33 halvings, so it takes around seven years until the last cannibal dies.  I think we can manage to get food production back on track by then, so&#8230;no worries, I guess.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If the short term is important, I’d suggest putting some of the seed corn into the seed corn converter &#8211; the ones that take the corn in one end and push out chicken eggs from the other. Good conversion ratio, too. </p>

The main plan seems to be:<br />
1) tear out all vegetation you can find; grind, press, and coagulate non-woody plant matter to extract concentrated proteins as food for humans;<br />
2) feed the leftover liquid and partially decomposed wood to chickens for eggs and meat;<br />
3) feed all cellulose-based solids to rabbits or rats for meat;<br />
4) feed wood and animal waste to insects (termites, beetles), or use it to grow mushrooms;<br />
5) throw everything else to bacteria, use chicken dung to fertilize water to grow fish and seaweeds.<br />
Cockroaches would also have a good potential to turn anything even vaguely organic into concentrated proteins and fats. I say once they&#8217;re dried, ground, and finely sieved, most people won&#8217;t mind too much.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Based on <a rel="nofollow"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass_(ecology)" rel="nofollow ugc">wikipedia</a>, the biomass of cattle, sheep, goats and chickens is approx. 1.75 times the biomass of humans.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow"href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/105/" rel="nofollow ugc">xkcd What if?</a> made calculations about how long (some of) humanity could survive on cannibalism only. According to it, a human would need to eat approx. one another human per month. (Source is not too reliable and not available anymore; we may last longer on meager rations.) Assuming the aforementioned livestock is about as nutritious as humans, they would be enough for approx. 1.75 months. That doesn&#8217;t include pigs and some other livestock, plant based food available to harvest, and fish. In order to be able to eat said animals, we need to be able to feed them (has animal feed been taken?), or enough capacity to freeze them.</p>
<p>A lot depends on the time of the year. I don&#8217;t know how worldwide production at different times of the year relates to the minimum amount of nutrients needed to keep most people alive and capable of working. </p>
<p>Grains that are harvested in a narrow part of the year and then stored for up to almost a year do not dominate our diet anymore, at least in developed and middle income countries. Also, the Southern hemisphere produces food when the Northern hemisphere doesn&#8217;t, and vice-versa. Parts of the tropics produce year-round, I guess.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I’m less pessimistic than most of you townies. Where I live, almost all of the food is either a) In the ground , or b) walking around on top of it. At this time of the year everything is growing like mad and harvest time, for a lot of things, is already upon us.</p>
<p>Sooner or later I guess some of the people who live in the foodless urban environments are going to come out to the sticks to see if they can get their hands on some of our sheep, or chickens or potatoes &#8211; of which we have a plentiful abundance, as do all our neighbors. The good news for us is that here in France, it’s only country folk that have the guns. So if it all gets a little bit feisty, we’ll probably be all right.</p>
<p>Seeing as the aliens have presumably emptied all our freezers, I guess the first thing we’d do is go out into the woodland and and kill enough deer and wild boar to fill the freezers up again. </p>
<p>And it might turn into a time of plenty &#8211; our next door neighbor has a herd (well, 15 &#8211; it’s rural France I’m talking about, so what local farmers live on is ‘subsidies’) of milking cows. If, as I expect, the big Lorry that comes every two days to collect his milk fails to turn up as infrastructure has started to break down, he’ll be looking to offload his now worthless surplus milk. Perhaps to be exchanged for some venison and a few chicken eggs. We’ll therefore also be sorted for cheese, butter and yoghurt. Things are looking up!</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m&#8230;optimistic. For one thing, all infrastructure is still standing, so whatever solution we find, it&#8217;s there to scale it up. Let&#8217;s make it challenging &#8211; say it happens on Nov 1st &#8211; so nothing to harvest in the northern hemisphere. </p>
<p>People die pretty slow from starvation. I&#8217;m pretty sure most people can shed about 10kg and be healthier than when they started, so that&#8217;s about a month and a half. True, that&#8217;s for the average person, so we do have to take care of the skinny ones somehow &#8211; especially children and elderly. If we fix this, we have about 2 months before A LOT of people die. It&#8217;s gonna be pretty busy holidays.</p>
<p>How do we fix the short term problem? Eggs, milk and meat. A bit of googling says about 1kg/month/person just for eggs. Mmm. That&#8217;s like 50 cals/day. About 10 times as much milk but lower caloric content, so say 150 cal/day. Meat is somewhere in between, say 2 kg/month minimum and&#8230; damn. It&#8217;s gonna be tight &#8211; just an extra 100 cals. BUT &#8211; we will definitely not be saving meat for later while starving, so by butchering long lived animals early, we can easily double the monthly output for at least a couple of month. Probably triple. So 350-450 cal/day/person short term. If properly distributed it would keep kids and skinny people alive, but I don&#8217;t trust efficient distribution so we&#8217;d better hurry. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s also import from the south &#8211; I&#8217;m a bit hesitant here, because the south will be hungry for at least a week or two until the supply chain gets fully refilled, so they&#8217;ll be hesitant to export. But I doubt they&#8217;ll let billions die, so in a few weeks we should see some stuff flowing from there as well. Impossible to tell how much &#8211; 100cals/day? 500? Not enough, certainly.</p>
<p>How do we fix the long term problem?</p>
<p>I see three directions: greenhouses, oil and making cellulose digestible. </p>
<p>Greenhouses have the benefit of being tested technology. We can make them everywhere &#8211; either from glass on open land, or by taking a bunch of dirt in existing warehouses. Some (admittedly not appetising) crops can be grown in <a rel="nofollow"href="https://www.naturallivingideas.com/18-fastest-growing-veggies-can-harvest-no-time/" rel="nofollow ugc">under a month</a>. But there&#8217;s a big difference between first crop and proper scaling, so I&#8217;m guessing at the very least three months before proper production. Not good. Hopefully in about two months they&#8217;ll add a bit to the calorie deficit, but either way, still a full month missing there. </p>
<p>The other two options, namely oil and cellulose, are pretty interesting. They could probably ramp up production in a matter of weeks instead of months, but unfortunately I have no idea of the details involved. Maybe somebody else has? All I can tell from google is that 1. yeah, it&#8217;s possible, at the very least alcohol from oil and glucose from cellulose. And 2. nobody in their right mind would normally consider it. But well&#8230; alien friends.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Interesting. I hadn&#8217;t known it was possible to grow edible plants in just a few weeks. I though it took months. That makes it easier, at least if the foodpocalypse happens during the growing season. And with greenhouses and artificial lighting, we just might be able to grow food during the northern hemisphere winter. It would be expensive as heck, but the alternative is mass starvation.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Most of those plants are not terribly good staples.<br />
And sprouts are getting most of their energy from the seeds.  </p>
<p>But stuff like parisienne carrots, first early potatoes and dwarf legumes should be good.  </p>
<p>We might also be saved by the practise of leaving fully grown root vegetables in the ground during the winter. (it&#8217;s as cold outside as it would be in a fridge, so why bother harvesting them before they&#8217;re needed?)</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Does expired food count? </p>
<p>Does pet food count? </p>
<p>Do edible seeds count? </p>
<p>Do beverages count?  </p>
<p>Do condiments count?  </p>
<p>Because for every one of those that counts, the problem shrinks significantly. On a &#8220;if you ate only that for supper, would your mother tell you it wasn&#8217;t food&#8221; basis, humanity&#8217;s quite well-provisioned to get through a short-term crisis until we do a lot of fishing, dairy and a slaughtering. </p>
<p>I actually think we&#8217;d be alright. For one thing, you can go a LONG time without food. A lot of sick and elderly people are going to die/be allowed to die/be encouraged to die. But all of the above have a strong argument not to be food and would be attainable in quantity relatively easily. Even without those, the pipelines for supplying meat and dairy are fairly short. Grains and vegetables are where things get a lot dicier. Fortunately, a lot of weeds and other such things are technically edible.</p>
