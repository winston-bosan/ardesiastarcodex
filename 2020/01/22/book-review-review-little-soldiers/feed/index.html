Work is different in agricultural societies vs industrial plants... 

When you work - often it&#039;s 24 hr/day x 7days/week until the work is done...  It&#039;s nothing for farmers to be planting all night long when the weather/season is right... It&#039;s the same at harvest time - Ripe crops rot - so you have to get them out of the field/vine when they are ready - not when you are ready....  Tomatoes only last a few days and 1-field gives you several tons all within 1-week... You have to get them picked and processed NOW!!!!   I knew several men who made their entire year&#039;s salary in 3-months picking oranges (they worked 24x7 only taking off a single shift here or there to sleep) - they would then work odd jobs for &quot;walking money&quot; as the opportunity arose through the rest of the year.

The converse of this is the &quot;steady&quot; pace of Industrial work... It&#039;s the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow... Rain or shine...   So you work your 8-hrs and go home... The work is the same tomorrow.... 

But this still exists for the most part.....  &quot;Jobbers&quot; work intensely when there is work available - and &quot;Lay around&quot; when it isn&#039;t.... I know a lot of men who live this way - and they can get paid a surprisingly large amount of money for being available &quot;Right Now!!!&quot;]]></description>

Right - except we do the opposite.... We punish kids who do well by grinding them through vastly harder work and more and more of it instead of making a big high-status reward out of it... 

Want to double the number of kids earning high grades in High School?   Offer a free &quot;Skip&quot; day every month for kids who maintain an A average!   I bet the Honor Roll numbers would double.... 

One of the incentives that has shown to REALLY work well in schools is to allow kids to skip final exams if they have an &quot;A&quot; average.... Kids will work twice as hard just for the privilege of having those days off...

I mean consider also that most companies fill management and Executive ranks with people who couldn&#039;t do math while Engineers are treated like deadbeat technicians...   

What does that &quot;Signal&quot; to students who work extra hard to grind it out?  Right - all the extra effort put into education is worth basically nothing....]]></description>

&quot;Culture&quot; you want to showcase in public only really develops with surplus wealth being available to fund it... China was one of the poorest per-capita nations in the world 30 years ago... 

Now that the Chinese incomes are coming up and people have some disposable income - we will see this change....]]></description>

Also - many American schools have consolidated and so distances children travel are much further.  

We are 10+ miles away from our kid&#039;s school... No way the kids are walking 10+ miles each way....   1/2 mile - Sure, walk or ride a bike... 10+ Miles - nope!]]></description>

It&#039;s also possible &quot;Suburbanization&quot; has something to do with this....

I mean if you look at something like crime &quot;Paying&quot; some threshold $$$/hour - it&#039;s a lot more time consuming to rob a few cars scattered through a couple miles with a lot of yards and dogs in-between than when they are all in the same building....   Seriously - lets say 10% of cars are unlocked just because...  You could go down a 1-mile suburban road to check 10 cars or go through some Big City Parking garage/Apartment Complex and pull 400 car door handles in one parking lot...     And so if you can make 5x as much working at WalMart, cutting lawns, or fixing cars - why resort to stealing?]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;If so, wage costs for a corporation should be under one percent of revenue.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No, that&#039;s only true under an immature oversimplification of economics. In reality, the corporation provides the worker with benefits it itself does not enjoy (notably stability), and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;it is very difficult to evaluate the relative performance and contributions of great programmers&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

(Sorry for accidentally clicking &quot;report&quot; instead of &quot;reply&quot; at first)

Children can generally understand games, where rules have to be obeyed. Why couldn&#039;t they understand the concept of a &quot;strict discipline day&quot; (or even week, etc) which its specific rules? (Except breaking them would have more serious consequences than most games).]]></description>
