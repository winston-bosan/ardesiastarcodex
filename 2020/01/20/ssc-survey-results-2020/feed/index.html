I was astonished to see that roughly 40% of the people here have JD degrees. That can&#039;t be right, can it?]]></description>

Google Forms does not provide that feature. One can use Google Apps Script to implement it, though.

That said, most people have easy access to at least three different devices that are likely to have different IPs (phone on cellular network, home network, work/university network), so this would not help all that much in identifying the cheaters.]]></description>

It just means the US is wealthier and has higher salaries for many professions.  In as much as that provides support for the Hive Mind hypothesis, it should have already been taken into account, so it is not &quot;further&quot; support.  But as @Alexander Turok points out, the US has higher salaries for many professions even compared to other countries with similar IQ, so it fails to support that hypothesis.]]></description>
